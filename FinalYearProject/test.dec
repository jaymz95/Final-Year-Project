Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?

Forget it.

Cameron.

Seems like she could get a date easy enough...

Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.

I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.

What crap?

Let's go.

Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?

Is he oily or dry?

Queen Harry?

At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.

You're welcome.

What?

Why?

As in...

I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.

So did you

No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.

Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.

It's just a party. Daddy.

Daddy, no!

The prom?  Kat has a date?

I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.

Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.

That's her?  Bianca's sister?

Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?

He seems like he thrives on danger

They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?

Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?

I thought you hated those people.

In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.

Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.

It's a lung cancer issue

Dead at forty-one.

The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?

Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.

Yeah -- we'll see.

Don't make me do it, man

Sure

And why would I do that?

You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?

We're not.

Does this conversation have a purpose?

Patrick Verona   Random skid.

But imagine the things he'd say during sex.

William would never have gone to a state school.

No fear.

Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .

Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.

Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?

My mission in life.

I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.

I just need to lie down for awhile

Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.

But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.

Busy

My father wouldn't approve of that that

BIANCA

What are you doing here?

You 're so --

Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.

C'mon.  It's not that bad

Forget it.  I'm stayin'.

Maybe.

I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.

Yeah, well, don't let it get out

Acting the way we do.

I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.

You know what I mean

I thought you could use it. When you start your band.

Don ' t you even dare. . .

Then tell them I had a seizure.

I thought you were punishing me.

When I go?

I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.

Just smack her now.

Yeah.  I guess.

What?

So Dorsey can get the girl?

What's to discuss?

Pirate -- no question.

Dr. Ruth?

We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.

Excellency, you are right.

Is that all that interests you? Gold?

I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!

I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.

There'll be a time.

Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!

Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.

What is it?  A tribe?  An island?

Thousands.

To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...

Passion is something one cannot control!

I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.

I knew you would.

Surely you can do anything you want.

They come and go as naked as the day God created them...

The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.

You think I don't know that?

Never, Your Majesty.  Although...

Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!

Is this true, Brother Buyl?

He must be replaced.

Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!

Divorced.

No.

They're not gonna send you right back.

Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?

I'll get my clothes.

I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.

But Chief?  Over this??

Yeah, right.

Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.

Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.

Good.  Good.  Commendable.

Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.

I'll call it... tails.

I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.

Something back home?

Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.

If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.

We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.

Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.

Yeah.  Now's not a good time.

Tonight.

Yeah.  I promise.

I'm not moody.

I am butcher.

You stuff sausage in it.

What?  It doesn't work that way.

Two weeks holiday.

Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?

We have no money.  Come on.

I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.

Shut up.

The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.

And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.

What does it look like?  It's an address book!

Sit down!

Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.

Surprise!  Surprise!

A job?

As a plumber?!

Excuse me?

Thanks.  Appreciate it.

Evidence.  Of a homicide.

He's my collar!

Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!

Clean?

Aren't you tired?

Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.

Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.

Your doctor?

...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?

You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.

How did they manage to do that without any communication?

I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.

Sure, what is it?

It's possible.

I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.

I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.

Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.

But not completely inconceivable?

Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.

Are you reasonably awake?

Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?

Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.

Yes, it is, Hal.

It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.

Did they have any explanation for this?

I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?

No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.

In three days, darling, I hope.

I'll bet it's a fortune.

How is gregor?

You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?

Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.

Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.

I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.

True.

Roger.

Hal, check all airlock doors secure.

Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.

Hammond.

Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...

Whaddya mean, buy?

He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.

Here's hoping, baby...

I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.

I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...

In the back.  Down the other corridor.

Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...

Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.

Just throw me the Goddamn gun.

Thank you.

Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.

She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?

Last night, two nights ago, three?

At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?

It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.

But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...

While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.

Not likely, convict.

In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?

Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.

I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.

I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?

You sure that's the reason?

Don't worry about it.

Whatever play I maker just back me up.

Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.

No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?

Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.

I lost them, that's what happened.

Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.

I didn't have the time.

Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.

Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.

They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.

Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.

So do you...been a long day.

Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.

I'm heading out. How about you?

I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?

Hey, you know what I really think?

Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.

Jack, are you okay?

Jack?  What was that?

Hi, it's me...

What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.

Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...

Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.

I don't know what you're talkin' about.

Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...

It's loaded... I got some shells in here.

Give it back.

I brought the girl remember?

Good luck..

Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!

White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.

Thank you, Mr. President.

Perfect.

Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.

On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.

I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!

I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!

Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.

I was talking to the cat.

You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.

Don't exist bud.

So, just how big was this fare?

...'Scuse me?

Yes ma..

...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!

Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.

This is a police control action..

Found it?

Uh... not really.

Crystal.

It's like a cab isn't it?

Where have I heard this song before?

What is it?

Three of us will never fit in there!

Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.

Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!

All 900.

Apipoussan!

The wind blows... the fire burns...

I'm so tired...

You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...

Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!

I love you...

This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.

It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.

Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.

Yes, Sir!

Got it.

Smoking?  I'm not smoking.

Well, I'm not smoking, okay?

Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.

I don't know what to say

She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.

There's nothing harder.

What can I do for you today?

Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.

We can do that.

I'm camera shy.

Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.

What are you... ?

Look, I don't know what this...

What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...

Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...

One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...

What do you want?

Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.

Something like that.

What the fuck do you want from me?

Why?

You enjoy it?

Stop talking.

Where?  Show me where.

Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.

Of what sort?

That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.

They're no friends of mine.

Fuck you.

Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.

From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?

Four hundred a week, off the books.

Interesting theory.

I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?

I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?

Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...

It's their Presidential Suite.

Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?

I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...

What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?

It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.

I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.

Do you want to tell me what you found?

I'm afraid I don't...

Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.

Okay, I follow you so far...

You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.

I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.

Yes, but...

Neil... Neil Cole.

No.

You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.

You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.

No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.

We're all like that.

I don't know.  I think so.

Will you let me look?

You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?

Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...

Who are you?

No...

No... no... no...

That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.

He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?

Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.

But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.

What's wrong?

It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.

Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?

You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.

Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.

That obvious, huh?

The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.

Why can't we just talk to the authorities?

Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...

Oh God!  He killed them!

It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.

Don't worry, honey

And ours.  It's our grandchild.

You're not taking my baby!

No...

She doesn't want me around

Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.

It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.

Jesus!  Don't do that!

You're right.

Me too.

Sobering...

Alice...

Since my little girl became a mom...

They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.

No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.

What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??

We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!

Yeah.  I'm just aces.

I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?

She must've fallen asleep at the table...

That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.

Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.

It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.

Your 'out.'  This came for you. 

Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...

- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!

Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?

'Us?'

What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!

You know - it <u>is</u>?

What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?

The frogmen?

Yes, Griff?

Radiation level...constantly rising...

Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!

I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.

Huh?

Thirty-four seconds!

What?

Nothing we can do, now.

Come where?

- for horrors like yourself?

This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.

Same old shit.

Yeah. I know about that.

Tell me.

Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?

You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.

You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.

Oh.

Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.

A half mile in, along the old lumber road.

What blood?

Yeah.

To us it was.

I don't want to.

I want to go home.  I don't like it here.

Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.

Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --

I know.

I'm not saying that.

Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.

You want me to follow them to Littleton?

You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?

You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?

You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.

Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.

For a while.

Okay. She's fine.

Said what?

Yeah. I mean that.

Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?

You knew me as a kid.

Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.

I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.

I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.

Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--

Yes. Here's your ticket.

I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?

Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.

It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.

His office. You mean my old office.

Sleeping.

I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.

In the living room.

Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.

Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.

Everything you know is from me.

Crawl!

I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.

There was something. It happened up your way.

He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.

You think Jack shot him?

Huh?

I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.

What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?

They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?

Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.

A hunting accident is perfect.

Not particularly.

Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.

You must be tired. It'll wake you up.

It was the experience of a lifetime.

Daddy...

Been better, Dad... You?

I'm doing what I can.

Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.

We don't know that.

That kid's name was Jim Marshall.

I prefered the terrorists.

Thanks.  Wrote it last night.

Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.

To swear you in as President.

Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.

Where are we now?

Tower, here.

This is a remarkable aircraft.

I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.

You will be the first to pay for that mistake.

Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.

Over my dead body.

One thing I've learned as

I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.

Yes, sir.

Rose, I don't have time for this.

She's a big girl.  She understands.

Please... don't start with me.

Excuse me?

We're handling it, sir.

You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.

I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.

I might still have a few chips left.

Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?

I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?

How long's it been since you flew, sir?

I just wish it was that simple.

Te...!

There's nothing wrong with me!

I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.

Ted!

I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.

That's right -- premature ejection.

Set!

Compute!

Is that a good sign, Doctor?

Simon.

You can do it from up here, Captain.

Go ahead.

Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.

Scraps.

Yeah.

We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...

Yes.

Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.

Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?

Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.

Surely there must be something you can do.

Yes. Yes, of course.

Well...

Ted!

Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?

I remember everything. All I have are memories.

Headquarters!? What is it?

Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.

Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.

It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.

You promise you'll write.

Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.

I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.

...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.

I will, but Jim won't.

Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?

Of course.

Thank you.

No. No thank you.

Does that cost extra or you throw them in?

Yeah...

The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.

Show me.

No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...

It is his new partner that I'm worried about.

Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.

My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.

His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.

And still it fits?

Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.

Did you learn anything?

Uh, Matthew...

But I-- .

Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.

When will Strader return?

We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.

I appreciate your honesty, George.

Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?

Nothing.

Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...

Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.

Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.

If the drug is here, we must destroy it.

Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?

Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.

The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.

Fuck procedure.

Do what?!  George-- ?!

We can't let him get away.

Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.

You look very good.

What is it?

Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.

Sure.  Just a minute.

Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.

Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.

Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.

Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.

Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.

I got him.  Don't get pinned.

Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?

Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!

Talk to me, Hudson.

Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!

Say again?  All after incinerators?

Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...

Yes.  That follows.

How long until it blows?

See you soon.

Well, thanks, I --

Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...

They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.

Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.

I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.

Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...

You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.

Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.

Sorry to disappoint you.

You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.

Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.

I don't know.

All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...

...We're coming in.

We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.

On my way.

Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.

But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.

Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.

We ain't going anywhere.

No.  Have you?

Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.

Think of what?  We're fucked.

Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.

What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.

I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!

I don't want to...I have scary dreams.

Did you ever have a baby?

Where is she?

I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.

Look!

That's right.

Yes, honey.  I think we both can.

It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.

Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.

A Turkish brothel.

Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.

What?

Extremely clever.

Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.

Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.

Who the devil are you? What do you want?

I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.

We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.

Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.

Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.

Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!

What?

Eat

Of course.

Oh yes? You always know everything.

Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.

Tell them to go!

Well, ask her!

I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?

No one.

Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.

It's killing me.

Madame. How can I help you?

Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.

No, sir. This is my own idea.

Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!

Tonight?

He asked me to stay.

Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.

Leave him alone!

Oh, yes.

In three months! Papa.

But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!

Adorable!

Behold!

Gertrude!

Yes. He is a little strange.

Majesty.

Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.

Yes?

Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!

Enchanted, Madame.

Thank you, Sire!

Yes, Sire.

Who told you this, Majesty?

Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.

Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.

Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -

I will.

Is she not here?

Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.

Don't you have a maid?

How is your financial situation?

How many?

It's a secret.

Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!

This is just a game, Papa.

Mine?

I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?

Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'

Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?

Yes what?

They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.

Yes, well, it's all good fun.

What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?

Madame.

Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?

Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?

Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.

But this is absurd!

Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.

It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.

Of course not.

It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.

Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!

Oh no! My wife took it out in time.

I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.

I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?

How could it not, Excellency?

How much?

You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.

Finish what?

My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.

Of course.

Come. Let's begin.

Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?

You go fast!

I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?

I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.

But, Your Majesty -

But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.

A little modesty would suit you better.

Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.

Mozart -

Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?

I know a little. I studied it in my youth.

I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?

And do they believe it?

He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.

God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.

I did.

Yes?

Incredible.

Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?

I can't wait.

Show her in. Then go to bed.

Yes, I am looking after him.

I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.

Dr. Hirsch?

Yes, Doctor?

I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.

They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.

No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.

David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?

Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?

Tea would be nice.

I beg your pardon?

Please, really. I'm not hungry.

How is that?

Right.

I thought you were asleep.

I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.

That's not really a very proper question.

I'm sorry I woke you up.

I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.

I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.

Lovely.

I wasn't hallucinating.

Werewolves simply do not exist.

Okay.

See you later.

The zoo?

Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.

Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!

Will you shut up!?!!

No.

No.

You did, did you?

Oh, come on, tell us.

That's very funny, that is.

The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?

Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?

Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.

Yes.

A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.

Nice to see you.

I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.

What do you mean? I'm starving.

I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.

I have no idea.

I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.

Yeah.

Not far enough. Come on.

Are you going to help me up?

Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?

David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.

The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.

Nurse! Oh God! Alex!

I wanted to see you.

David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...

I want you to meet some people.

Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.

Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.

Campari and soda would do nicely.

Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.

No.

Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?

And what, Sergeant?

I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.

She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.

Yes - sure

How much?

It was more than that last week.

It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.

All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.

I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.

Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.

So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.

I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.

We've been waiting fifteen minutes

I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.

But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!

Why not?

Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?

Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!

Why, I needed a

Line?

Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?

Well, aren't you going to invite me?

Don't you know?

What are you doing here?

Yes, sir.

Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.

Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?

But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.

Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .

Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?

Yes, sir.

Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.

Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?

I haven't any.

Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?

But I haven't . . .

If he can do it, yes.

Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.

Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.

Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?

Yeah.

Well, he was making love to her.

Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.

Oh, Charlie again.

All right, dear.

Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.

Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.

Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!

Yes, why?

What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?

It couldn't have been earlier?

I don't know.

Okay, Matt.

Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.

Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!

How?

Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.

It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.

Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.

Tomorrow.

Best damn plan I heard all war.

One false move and I'll blow your heads off!

You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!

You are a fine figure of a man.

He's been full of vinegar lately.

What?

Tell me.

I think I recognize you.

No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --

It was exciting.

Sorry.

Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.

It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.

Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --

That's it.

Pass me some whisky.

Who's next? You? Me? Bob?

You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.

I'm thinking...

Which one, right or left?

Shakespeare.  He's European.

Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?

All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...

Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.

On account of we're robbing it.

I'd appreciate that.

The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.

I think he's already feeling better.

So we got a plan?

I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.

All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.

What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.

Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."

Damn. All that reading paid off.

Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?

Fine. How'd it go out here?

Got any ideas, little brother?

Jim was old enough...

Sounds like he was a hell of a man.

Yeah Jimmy?

A fair number, Ma.

Boys?

Nuh-huh ...

No! I mean, of course not. No.

You didn't want to farm?

A river pirate.

Me neither.

When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.

Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!

She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.

That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.

I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.

Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.

Stop it. This is just sad.

What?

But I like the presidential suite.

Pity.

Right here in church?

Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.

Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.

You been with a girl ever?

I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.

Really?

Move you fools!

NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!

Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.

THEN WHO DID?!

Not to mention my men who lost their lives.

Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.

I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.

I can't believe this.

I demand action.

Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.

Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.

Yes.

Turn the light on.

You and...Luis?

You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.

Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.

I don't want to talk about it.

Because I...want...to...fit...in.

My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.

But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.

Oh God, I can't believe this.

What are the rules for a sweater vest?

Nice.

I know her. I knew her.

How did you guess?

Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"

No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.

It's just not.

Calm down. Let's do it anyway

But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.

Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.

No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.

Two at nine? Perfect.

Negative. Cancel it.

Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.

Can you bring Mr...

Yes, Patrick?

Oh no. I have no plans.

Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.

Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.

You didn't give them a name.

No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.

Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?

What's that?

Hmmmm.

Jean? Hello? Jean?

Hello? Jean, I need help!

What are I doing?

Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.

Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.

Uh huh?

He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.

Paul Owen.

No.

Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.

No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?

Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.

No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?

Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.

No. I'm okay.

The disappearance of Paul Owen.

I think his family wants this kept quiet.

Harvard. The Harvard Business School.

I know. I'm sorry.

I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.

What do you mean...Yale thing?

No. Not really.

No, he just hung out there.

We were both seven in 1969.

No.

It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...

People just...disappear.

Eerie. Really eerie.

Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.

Let's see...  That you were with-

Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.

Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.

Where was Marcus?

It's cold out, too, isn't it?

You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.

I can't...I can't find a shelter

Oh well, you know.

They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.

Teddy was killed last night.

It was a hate crime.

You're scaring me. I think we should just go.

"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.

Milo. Why would he --

Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --

Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?

Nothing.

...Different?

He has thousands of employees, Milo --

I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.

You're just afraid to eat it.

...It's -- Milo, isn't it?

Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.

My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.

'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.

No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.

What'd they ever do for you?

Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.

We tried!

He's pretty tight with his family.

...Do I?

I'm sure.

Definitely.

...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.

'Sorry about the late notice...

I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.

You see what's hanging on the wall?

Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --

In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.

You do?

Cool.

They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.

I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.

No. Please.

"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?

Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?

You're compulsive.

She saved my life.

No, no. Never.

Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!

And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.

Gary.

Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --

That's lame, isn't it?

What?

Uh. Not exactly.

What?!

I met this girl.

Oh we're not going to the campus.

You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.

Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.

Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --

Where is he?

That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?

Is it about my teeth?

Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?

Smashing!

Thank you, Exposition.

Yes?

There's one more thing, Austin.

Be careful.

Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.

What's the other thing you're scared of?

What?

Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.

If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?

I'm sorry?

I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.

I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.

No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.

I'm sure.

Do you want to talk to him?

Well, you know... cows, and shagging.

Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.

Indeed.

We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.

Lay it on me.

That's not mine.

Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?

Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.

Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!

These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!

Thank you, Herr Doctor.

They're mutated sea bass.

Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.

We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.

Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.

Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.

Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?

Scott, don't say that...

Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.

People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.

Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.

I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.

Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?

You don't say. How real does it feel?

... preserve...

This isn't a game.

After the cold war ...

You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.

We want to help...!

The Institute ... the funding ...

Quite frankly ... it could have been you.

Valentine, listen to me ...

How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.

I'll never marry you.

Whereas you are.

Rules are made to be broken.

And just what is the game?

Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.

Mother?

Thank you, Trubshaw ...

Did he say who?

Is that written in his shoe?

... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...

I expect we'll have to gatecrash.

Mrs. Peel ... ?

Nothing personal.

You don't trust me?

Where are you going?

Have you any place in mind?

It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.

I know all this.

Surveillance? By whom?

Who's now vanished.

I fail to see --

Well, I can't possibly go like this.

I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?

So you say ...

Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...

Guilty until proven innocent?

Check out the other guy's buns.

I feel like I'm spying on Rick.

Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.

Chulo, one thing at a time.

When do the girls get to the party?

You dump her and I'll give you cash.

I'm marrying Debbie.

What is this person's story here?

The best.

I'm very happy for you two.

Maybe it had something to do.

Yes I did.

Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...

Thank you, sir.

Cole, I'm sorry, I...

Good...

Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.

Gonna get married...

Did I promise that? I don't remember that...

Your mother's not dead.

Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.

Yes...

That's more like it.

Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.

I'm going to see what the hell happened.

You're a pimp?

Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.

Yeah, I guess so.

I couldn't find any razor blades.

All right, who serves?

Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.

Rick!

No sob story is going to change my mind.

No, Brett, I...

Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.

Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.

My gift to you.

The best table in the house.

If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.

I'm saved. Let's party!

You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.

Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.

Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?

Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.

Let me take the lead, Stephen...

Just come down, John. Just --

-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --

It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.

Thanks for the speakers.

Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.

I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.

What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.

Hey.

What, are you kidding? By myself?

I waited... I would have fucking waited...

Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?

Thanks for the insight.

Saw what?

-- What are you doing here?

I know.

You look great.

So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.

Yeah? What have you been up to?

Really? No kidding.

Carrying Swayzak's notebook?

Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.

Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?

But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.

Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.

Then why did you quit?

-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.

Hi.

Your boss is lying, Jennifer.

I quit two days ago, Brian.

Hey, do I know you?

So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...

Who's doing this?

What?

I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.

The outlets.

-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.

Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.

Pest control.

No it couldn't.

But the right guess on this is arson.

Are you going public with this?

I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.

Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.

It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?

No.

I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...

Like it never happened...

Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.

You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.

Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.

Fixing my roof.

Okay.

Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.

Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.

Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...

He works for me.

Tell him about me, Shadow?

And old ladies?

Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.

Investigator Rimgale.

Alderman.

Just catch the son of a bitch.

Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...

They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.

She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.

Who?

I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.

That's my problem. Just put in my bet.

...that simpleton is holding back the race.  They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?

We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.

Did he gots to be.

Let's go NIGGERS.

Give me some?

I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?

Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?

Please.

What's your name?

You might be right.

No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.

You ain't happy about the green light?

Damn skippy.

You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.

And this is Manray.

We might need some mo' money behind this.

And I'm the feet.

Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?

Well do something about it.

Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.

I've never been given a fair shot.

I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.

It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.

It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.

Exactly!

And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?

This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."

Who are the other characters?

In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."

I don't know about that plantation angle.

I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.

Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.

The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.

I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.

How did you end up here?

Where do you go from here?

Always keep 'em laughing.

The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.

Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?

Hello.

I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.

Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.

A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.

This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.

I thought it was appropiate.

To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.

I don't want to hear it.

I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.

You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.

The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.

You sound like the media.

Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?

Not at all?

My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?

First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.

What do you mean?

Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.

Oh her.

...no, she didn't...

Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.

A song a comin' I feel.

Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.

Just a little something' somethin'.

Gots no intention of ending up broke.

Good morning.

This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.

I have acted as I think fit.

It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?

Not yet, but I believe he intends to.

Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.

Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.

A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.

Is Miss Dugan well?

The coward!

I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.

Your honor must lower his voice.

Yes, sir.

Only the agency of servants.

I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.

Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.

Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.

But, for a time... a passing fancy?

How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?

What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?

Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.

I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.

To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.

With pleasure at finding the ribbon.

Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.

I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.

Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.

It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.

Yes!

Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.

Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...

That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.

Yes, of course.

Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.

Would you have me spend my life all alone?

The milkmaid's daughter?

Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.

And he doesn't care about me?

You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.

Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.

It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!

Can anybody hear me!

HEY!

What do you mean, alone?

I just don't like it.

Did Kendall tell you about the PX?

Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.

Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.

Epilepsy.

Can't do that now, though, can you?

I...

West's. Any kindling for afire?

Oh, come on --

Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.

From up close or far away?

They?

Put it down!

I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.

I didn't kill him --

I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.

Because I was standing next to him.

Maybe --

It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.

The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.

I'm not gonna let that happen.

He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.

From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.

Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.

What are you talking about?

I wanted to see if he was okay --

That is the most unprofessional --

I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --

Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.

You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --

What?

And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.

Positive. Hardy, they planned this.

You couldn't have known --

Yeah.

Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.

Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?

Good, just making sure.

Hardy, for Chrissakes --

No death certificates. No crime.

Tough.

Think it'll work?

I should probably write that down.

You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?

So you took off your shirt?

He wanted more than that.

"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.

What?

What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --

What the fuck are you doing?

Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.

Bullshit --

No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --

Sir, yes, sir!

Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.

Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.

Edward Bloom.

Yes.

Fine, I will.

Fine, I'm doing it.

Thirty years. Maybe more.

Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?

I suspect it will hurt a lot.

I'm not convinced you should be happy.

I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.

I can get it. I can just...

I know.

I was dreaming.

No, I understand.

Can I take your picture?

Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.

Am I?

What did he say?

There's a lot you don't know about me.

You mean, while I'm here.

Can we talk?

Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."

It would kill you, huh?

The river?

How what happens?

Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...

I have the rest of my life to find out.

There is no softer ground than town.

I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.

This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.

Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.

I'll help you.

Mmm, what?

But it's not true.

He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.

But I understand you, Mom. I always have.

No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.

I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.

There's over eighty thousand here.

You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.

Leave him!

Ch...

Uh... Yes.

He says he feels safe here.

And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.

Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.

We better watch him. He's crazy.

"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.

He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.

I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.

Fine. I thought you were leaving today.

I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Happy bath day.

It's makes it easier. Okay.

What? No you're not..

No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?

Shut up. Have you got your passport?

I don't have any money.

I said I don't have any.

No. But you tend to tie them up.

You don't want to talk about it.

And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.

Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.

So now you hate all women?

You...

Get out

You don't have to say anything

Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?

It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.

She's dead.

I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.

I'm sorry.

Maybe you will find out.

Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.

I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.

You hurt it?

You take her to a doctor?

I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.

Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.

That'd be nice.

You gonna sing me somethin'?

Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.

I need ya help again.

That young lady's size, right'cher.

Sure.

You need a ride?

I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...

You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?

Stop what?

I got others.

Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.

It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.

Yeah.

If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...

Careful how you point that gun, boy.

Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?

Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.

The fuck you been doin' to me?

Get this Goddamn thing off me!

The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?

Whose doin' is that?

You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!

Itches.

Let go of me...

Uh-uh.

I can handle that.

Sure.

We drinkin' buddies now?

No joke.

Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?

Yeah, gal I been here before.

I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.

This Rae... you get with her?

Naw!

Don't know if God wanna see me.

Ain't gonna be moved?

Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.

Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.

I'm dealin' with what God put before me.

Not like that.

I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.

I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?

That's right.

I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.

Rae!

Holy shit!

Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.

Ronnie...

I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?

I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?

The hell you call me?

So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?

Charlie...

The Wolf?

Where is the subway station, please.

Go to sleep, Charlie.

I'd feel better if we had some heat.

He couldn't find his ass with both hands.

What does Charlie mean?

What's the problem here?

Give us a break...

There she is!

If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.

Smells like Bayonne at low tide.

He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.

It's done.  You don't have to come.

I can't...

I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.

I followed them.  An hour from the train station.

Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.

Where's Ich?

I don't remember you saying no.

Yeah.

He killed a police officer.

You're foreigners.

Why don't you ask your chief detective?

Twenty-four hours, detective.

For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!

I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --

The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.

Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.

He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.

If he won't cooperate?

Come here.

Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.

You're just all so... so different.

You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?

I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.

Dr. Tyrell?

Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.

Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.

There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.

Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.

Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!

I know all that.

Nexus designated Zhora:  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.

My pleasure.

Prosit.

Sorry, don't have the time.

Sorry.

Huh huh.

They'll change the limit before I change my mind.

Me too.

Do you recognize any of them?

What did she want?

Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.

For holes.

Does it eat?

I bet I would.

I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.

So?

It wasn't very good last night, was it?

What?

Hmmm?

Because it's not.

What difference will it make?

What's up?

Yes.

Go ahead.

If she is, the machine works.

Discreetly.

Don't move.

What one?

A tortoise.  What's that?

Of course.

I never seen a turtle.

They left.

I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?

You're all so perfect.

Yes?

I'm Adam Webber.

I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?

You're lost?

Yes, I'm right?

Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?

Get away from me!!

Rogers Hornsby?!?

So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.

What is it?!

No.

Sure.

What?

Hey, you know. I was thinking...

Okay.

Oh, I'm sure it will!

You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!

The big one!

I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?

That's what I was afraid of.

Of course.

The engine is still running.

Sorry!

Is this your house?

Um-hum.

Wow.

That's boring!

Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?

Well...yeah. Okay.

Do I look crazy?

Not that one!

And don't be so obvious!

Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.

You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!

I'm sorry.

Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!

Well, you had better!!

Is that what you call it?

No.

Yes, sir.

Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.

Tempus fugit!

Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!

It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.

Blow out the candles!

No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.

Merci!

Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.

You nut!

Really?  Since when?

I've never met anyone like you in my life.

Sorry, that's the largest city.

You don't have a computer in your cabin?

Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.

Ladies first, Troy! That was close.

What?

My father is a genius.

How old do I look?

Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.

I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.

Oh, you got a problem with that?

Yes, ma'am.

No, wait! At least stay for dinner!

No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.

I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--

And now you must let me be the judge of that!

The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.

Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.

Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.

You bet, hon!

Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.

I never know anymore.

Yes.

I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.

Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?

Then after that it's safe.

All our friends...

No, Calvin, you're favorite.

How could you?! This is just like home!

Honey?

Right here!

Yes.  Well... yes.

Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!

Just open the door.

I don't believe it!

We do?

Excuse me.

We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--

Well, I am the head of this household--

What are you doing here?

Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.

Oh, my God...

Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.

I think...it...works.

Eve?!

Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!

I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?

Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.

Uh, yes, you do.

He didn't leave with them.

I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!

He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?

You didn't stop anywhere else?!

None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.

Um...uh...

Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!

Yes.

Blue. It's Blue Velvet.

It's blue. Blue velvet.

Yeah.

Yes sir.

We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.

Jeffrey nothing.

I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.

Nothing. Are you alright?

I'll go then.

No, please. I won't.

Yes, I like you.

Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.

Same here.

Frank? Can you stand up?

No.

I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.

Frank is coming?

That's good.

Sure I do.

Beeeee careful.

Kiss me.

Just get outta my bed.

You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.

No.  Hi baby.

'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.

Oh he forced you, huh?

Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.

Mommy's here.

If you want to.

Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  Hey, pretty, pretty.

Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?

Here's to Ben.

Yes.

Okay Frank.

Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?

Mom.

Alright.

Of course, Jeffrey.

Yeah. okay.

Yeah.

Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.

Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.

Yes.

Terrible boring.

That's too bad.

Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.

Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?

I'm here, aren't I?

Alright.

Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.

Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?

I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?

Yeah.

You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?

First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.

Why not?

Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?

Yeah.

Are you sure?

OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.

Yes.

Yeah. I mean a little, you know.

I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.

You better not, Jeffrey.

Goodnight.

Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.

Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.

Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?

What is it?

Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.

Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?

Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.

Yes mother.

Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.

What?

Get a hold of yourself, man.

Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.

He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?

Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.

I-I'll tip her.

This place is like a scumbag yard sale.

This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.

We're here brother.

BLAME...

What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!

Our mother can see through bags.

So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?

Be careful.

We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.

Right.

Aye.

Shut it. It's Ma.

Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.

"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."

What?

Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.

What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.

A-fuckin'-men!

Rule of thumb?

Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.

No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.

Pee...Per...Man.

The fat man.

Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.

What?

Twist of lemon!

Sweet-n-low!

Eight.

Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!

Yeah. Anybody call for me?

Y'know it is, a bit.

So?

Well, I'm sold.

What the fuck do you mean?

Y-Yes my son.

You believe?

Yes.

That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.

How long since your last confession, my son?

Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.

Yeah boss?

Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, "Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys...

He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."

Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.

As part of his plan. I don't know why.

The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.

He says. This is he.

Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.

Would they do that?

Yeah.

No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.

Like he meant it.

Dignan, those aren't running shoes.

They obviously weren't designed for racing.

On your marks...  Get set go.

No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.

Sure.

On the left.

No kidding.

This was in fourth grade.

Yes... It's true.

This morning.

He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.

No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.

OK.

What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.

You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --

That's not correct.

What is it?

Who's Mr. Henry?

Right. Freezers. Imported foods.

I'm sorry, Bob.

Did that hurt?

Take your second position.

It's going back down.

Applejack's stuck in the elevator?

I'll see you there.

I don't think so.

I'm not kidding.

It belongs to Bob's uncle.

How?

What?

Dignan, I --

Scale the --

Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.

Take a deep breath.

Yes, he did.

That sounds like Dignan.

I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.

Why'd you want to help us?

But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.

Let them fight.

See you, Bob.

I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.

Is that OK?

Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.

Sure.

No.

Who's got the car keys?

Cuba.

God, yes. Like silk.

Uh-uh.

True.

I don't know about that.

I told you he's crazy.

He electrocuted someone?

I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.

Don't count it.

They also found my two beam scale in the garage.

We'll have to see when we get back.

Well, obviously, we got to go back.

I can't do that, Bob.

His name's not Future Man, Dignan.

Yeah. It is.

Bullshit.

John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.

26 weeks.

Did you hear that?

You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.

Yes.

Well, I left some money in there.

No, my friend knows her.

Sure.

Got a little lucky.

It's locked.

Good to know you, John.

Pleasure to meet you, John.

And the Landy woman?

What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?

I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.

Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.

Don't you want answers?

No good options left?

No. You lost your way.

Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?

It's nothing. It's just a picture.

How... how can... how can you be here and say this?

No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.

I'm sorry.

Conklin up front.

-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?

We pushed it. We got lazy.

It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?

Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --

It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.

I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.

What do you mean?

Your first assignment was Geneva.

I was here!

I want someone I know to take me in.

Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.

I'm working on it.

But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.

Is there. Is all there.

-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --

For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.

Who's this?

Me? Four years.

Yes, sir -- ma'am...

If you say so.

You mean, did I want a date?

These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.

I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.

You've all sworn to Longshanks.

...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --

My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.

How many?

You win.

I could crush you like a roach.

I will not.

No. He did not.

This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.

My greatness is better demonstrated with this.

Let her speak.

It matters not, he is thy king!

Thank you for inviting.

No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.

...Tonight!

And I with you. But you must wake.

I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.

York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.

She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.

I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.

I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.

Every man dies. Not every man really lives.

We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.

I am trying.

Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...

Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?

When did you ever care about getting to school on time?

Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.

Something must've happened! What set him off?

No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.

Sure...

Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.

Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!

Are you sure? Not even with my father?

My journals! Where are they?

Huh?

Hi, Lenny.

Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...

What do you want to know, Evan?

So it didn't feel... weird?

You'll see.

Like how?

I walk differently?

No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.

Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?

Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?

We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.

Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.

That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.

It's crossed my mind from time to time.

It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.

...yes.

Who's to say you can't make things better?

We'll find out soon enough.

I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.

Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.

It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.

Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?

Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.

My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.

Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.

What's wrong with you?!

I thought so. Where's your husband?

He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.

Yes, Monsieur.

-- Will he keep his word?

But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...

No thanks, Carl.

-- Tonight he forgot.

Yes, sir.

Well, I'll get it from the safe.

Suppose we do.

You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.

Practically no one.

I'll tell him when he comes in.

Well, so long.

Good day.

You needn't be concerned about me.

What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.

What are they?

No.

And I was wondering.

Looking for a job.

Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?

Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.

Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?

You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.

-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.

It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.

And Laszlo?

-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?

She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.

Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.

Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.

I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.

Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.

If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.

Goodnight.

We'll discuss it later.

Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.

-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.

Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.

Sam?

Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?

How do you do?

I said, ask your wife.

Keep it. You'll need it in America.

Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?

All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.

This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.

We'll be there.

Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?

You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!

Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.

Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.

By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?

Mademoiselle.

I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.

A leader, like Laszlo?

Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.

What, again?

Yeah? What's his name?

Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.

-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.

Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.

And got well paid for it on both occasions.

Excuse me.

I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.

-- Thanks. I will.

Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.

Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?

Well, it looks like you're a little late.

Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.

Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --

Huh?

What friend?

Oh, thanks.

Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?

Put that gun down.

Our expenses?

I never make plans that far ahead.

What is your nationality?

If I gave you any thought, I probably would.

Not right now.

No, I don't.

Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.

Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.

Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.

You quitter you quitter you quitter.

I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.

They're on autopilot.

Nothing out there but ocean.

Okay.  Sure.

Do you...have any more packages to deliver?

Cold.

Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?

What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?

Not if you work for FedEx.

You don't seem too happy about it.

He's your cute thing.

We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.

Yes there is.

No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --

I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.

Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.

A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?

Hey...hey...it's okay!

That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.

Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.

Not when you have no choice.

I don't know.  I really don't know.

And how was your Christmas?

The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.

Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.

That new roof, that's your doing.

Don't you even think about it.

Who is this?  Where is Kamal?

Borrowed.  I borrowed it.

I'm touched.

Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.

Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.

We're on.

Forty-three days.

Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.

Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...

It claims to restore monthly regularity.

They just want you to hire some new help.

We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?

It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.

I'm *not* a doctor!

They'll believe it because they want to believe it.

I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!

Candy. Candy Kendall.

Burma!

Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.

I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."

She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?

I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.

Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.

Okay, okay--I know you do, too.

Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.

No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...

*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!

You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!

Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...

Hi...

I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.

He *loved* it!  Didn't you?

Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!

Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.

Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.

Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?

You're a little overqualified, aren't you?

*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.

Migrants?

Is it true?

You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?

Okay. Then you can be of use.

Yes, for both.

All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.

I haven't read that.

Can't a boy be a Dorrit?

I'm not crazy about the "Little..."

It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!

It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.

I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.

Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.

We heard that one already, Homer.

Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!

Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?

It's just my heart.

So what?

Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?

Not yet. What do you know about it?

*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.

Now, now. He's a good boy.

Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.

You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!

Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!

Why was he missing for twenty days?

Mind your own business, Peaches.

We see you next harvest.

It look nicer then home!

They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!

You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...

She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.

The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...

Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.

They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.

We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22

And you have this letter of intent?

You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.

The standard ten.

Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.

Isn't it always?

And these cops? What do they get?

We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.

Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.

You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.

It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.

And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?

So what? We hide, right?

We're going to give him the money back?

Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?

So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?

And what about Big Al?

Tonight. Just me.

She's up for it.

And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.

I have a good crew.

You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.

Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.

You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...

Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.

Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?

Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.

Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?

Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.

Lighten up.

For what? A couple hundred bucks?

Not in that repressed anger sort of way.

Good quality porn has it's place in the world.

Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.

WHAT?

Lily... Jesus Christ...

You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.

Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.

What about what?

Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...

We never had a problem with that before.

Where the hell is she?

I'm sorry.

Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.

What?

No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-

HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!

Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.

A Fed? Is he close?

What do you get out of it?

Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?

High five.

You called the casino a cesspit.

I despise the job.

What are you talking about?

I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.

Seven-fifty.

Habib?

She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.

Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.

I've got something to tell you.

450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?

Tension. It'll go.

I'll see you in my dreams.

Marion, stop this.

Haven't you got a conscience of your own?

What about a drink on the way home?

Why not?

It's the truth.

Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.

I hope it brings you luck.

-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?

It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.

Gambling's not about money.

Leave me alone, Marion.

Just an accident. Nothing.

Remember the guy who cheated at the table?

Then you're not a pro.

Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.

Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.

And I thought you were a bright woman.

The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.

Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.

Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you...

Who...

And what do you do, Lucy?

Turn left at the lights.

Over the river.

Thanks.

What the fuck are you talking about?

Good call. Help yourself.

I don't gamble.

I'll tell you later.

Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.

Has he?

I was at Beadles.

Do you have a Salon Prive?

We do. 

I said good call.

I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.

We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.

Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?

No.

Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.

Right, that checks out here.

Eventual supernova.

Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.

Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...

Well, it is kind of a long shot...

-- open quantum latches --

Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.

Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.

And I saw that I was alone.

But how do you know you exist?

Right!

All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?

True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.

Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?

Out where?

Ah, negative drop.

-- Remark.

Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.

I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...

They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...

I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.

Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.

Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.

No kidding?

Yeah?

Ah... pity, pity...

Well, what you might try is --

Doolittle, hello?

No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.

No?

How I make my living, what's your point?

Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.

I like to keep it professional, that's all.

That's a lotta crap.

Leave.  Now.

And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.

It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.

What?  Where're we going?

No way.

It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.

Theo rode for this place a long time, man.

Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.

A grand.

I ain't mad at you...

Later.

I don't get involved with guns.

I got overhead...

Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?

When?

We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.

Whoever that is.

People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.

You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.

Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.

Bent?

That would be appropriate, yes.

You need to get out more.

Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.

How much do you know?

The technical term for you is "chimera"...

The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.

She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?

She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.

You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.

Look, thank you for this but--

And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.

Ladies would be elsewhere.

She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.

I thought it was important for you to know the facts.

Oh?

Let go of my hand.

My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?

Sorry, I was seven at the time.

He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.

Nothing on Hannah?

They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--

Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--

You and me both.

Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.

You know what I'm saying.

More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...

Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.

Not right now?  Okay, when?

What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?

You get it when I get her.

You're the best, Maxie.

Feel like the dog's dinner.

I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.

Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.

Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.

How'd you get her out of town?

What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.

Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.

Gin.

Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?

Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.

I just told you, he's a big, hairy...

He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.

Yeah, a man's drink...

Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.

It's okay.

Yeah?

I don't care. I wanna hear more.

Right, slow...

What? That's disgusting!

Yeah.

What's in Sandusky?

One more time in English.

Plenty, but it was all bad.

Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.

Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!

Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.

The paint!

...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!

Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.

And if it ain't cleaned off?

Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?

It's my Bullworker.

Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.

Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.

See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.

Go ahead, Jam.

Uhh... nothing.

Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?

Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.

What?

You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.

Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!

Hello summer detention.

Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!

It's not nearly enough, punk.

No, you gimme your gun, boy!

Neither do I!

Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?

Yeah, you did!

Yeah.

So... that's it?

Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?

If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.

You'll know soon enough.

Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?

We went to a hotel.

A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.

Sure.

I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.

He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.

Wonder where we'll be then.

I'm going home.

With, like, images?

And what?

Are you okay?

She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?

Maybe she's asleep.

The whole movie. Let's go.

But you're OK?

No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.

We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.

Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?

How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?

It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.

Why should we care?

Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?

Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.

Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.

He said to follow him.

Yes.

I think about girls a lot.

I think about... fucking a lot during school.

No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!

I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.

Have you told Gretchen about the spears?

Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?

I know.

I... I was playing with fire.

Why?

God exists because you're horny.

I have the power to build a time machine.

Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.

Where is he, Donald?

You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.

Yeah.

Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.

I was just being honest.

Her name is Gretchen.

Excuse me? What's your name, son?

You're not a bitch.

It is a big deal.

Yep.

Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.

Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.

Beg pardon?

The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.

You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.

Raspberry.

No more fuckin' for her.

Don't let that worry you, Annette!

I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.

Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.

I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.

Really?

What? For chrissakes, spit it out.

Airport Ho-Jo!

Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.

No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.

They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.

We all do. Now let's go.

Here, have some.

Yeah...

Yes...

I know.

Loretta, shut it.

I got a hairdo.

Okay. Take her purse.

She's the winner and we're going to state.

My dress'll reek.

The important thing is that we have a winner...

Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.

A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.

Okay, everybody, listen up!

Enid ate a whole pan!

I want to get the big bag of little donuts.

Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!

What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!

He should be king!

And everything.  He should be king!

The king can do no wrong! 

Take a letter.

"My dear President"...

"My dear"...

"My"...

I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -

None of your business...  Take another letter.

I wanna powder my nose...

He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --

You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?

Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.

I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.

We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?

That's not bad for any day.

Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.

We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.

Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.

The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 

Your Excellency, haven't we met before?

Go ahead.

You worm!

Bah!! 

I still like UPSTART the best.

You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.

Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.

These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...

I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --

He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?

I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.

Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?

Well no -- not exactly -- but --

This is terrible!

Oh, would you...?

If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.

No, I think a whiskey.

I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.

And here are my mother and father.

Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.

He fell.  He falls.

Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.

Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.

Everything will be seen to.

So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!

Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.

No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.

Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.

Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.

Three quarters of an hour.

What a mess.

Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".

I knew you'd understand. Here.

Yes.

Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.

That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...

Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.

Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.

You're English.

Oh no, my friend...

Oh, yes.

I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.

...I learned a long time ago.

Yes John!

Say "Mmmerrick."

Say "Mmmerrick."

Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.

Of course! What did you think?

I thought as much.

There is one more thing, John. Here.

Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.

I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?

John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.

Welcome home, John.

I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.

I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.

Handsomely?... Who sent you?

Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.

There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.

I said welcome.

Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.

Yes.

What... you mean "got into bed with" them?

HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?

"The fifth one this week"!

Of course.

I... but I...

The second note to wake the Gods...

It was my master Keitel's idea.

What d'you mean?

Well... isn't it great?

That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...

Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --

They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!

Why?

Don't talk nonsense.

The important thing is not to panic.

Yes.

Sh!

You don't love ME.

Well you started it.

And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.

Ah.

Come on, move it!

You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".

You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?

Don't you FEEL it?

Sorry.

Sorry!

ROW!

Who gets killed?

Keitel Blacksmith?

But how could he know... unless...

How about making friends?

What are you talking about?

I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.

It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!

Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...

No, it is NOT.

Bastard.

What are you talking about?

I... I...

But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..

That's right.

Not now, Sven...

I'm just building up to it, Dad.

Neither am I.

I'm not frightened... of anything...

No, Mother.

Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.

Just a little overworked, maybe.

You were not.

I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.

Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.

You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?

Well, I didn't want to assume.

Get out! Me too! What are the odds?

Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?

Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.

My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.

I don't know any jokes about your name.

Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?

It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --

You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.

Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?

Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.

Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.

Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.

I do have a tendency to use that word too much.

Okay.

You'll call me, right?

You didn't say anything about my hair.

I don't want to talk about this here.

Yeah, Tangerine?

What do you mean?

Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.

Yeah.

Naomi, I guess.

I'll buy that. Black's always good.

I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.

But you weren't. I could tell.

Is that what you want?

Okay.

Hi.

I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.

yeah?

Okay.

Hey, Joel --

Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.

I can't stop thinking about you.

Your dried cum.

Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.

There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...

There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.

It's not somebody else.

I had a good time last night. I really did.

Yeah. Cool.

Hi.

Sorry. I just --

'kay.

We haven't checked.

Go.

What?

Well, what should we do?

Can I... I brought some --

Yes?

Welcome, Howard.

That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.

Is that Nietzsche?

It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.

It was a mutual decision.

I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.

I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.

1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.

Oh dear.

Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.

Maybe after the holidays then.

Yeah.

Patrick, we need to focus.

Jesus, Patrick!

Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.

Easy come, easy go.

I'm staying with the Countess.

Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.

Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'

FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.

It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.

Well.... er...

If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'

When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.

I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...

So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?

Don't start with me, Cooper.

You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...

You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?

You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.

You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.

Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.

No, he didn't.

It is not.

You're okay now, it's over...

There must be a way! What about Engineering?

Run!

I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.

Hear what?

What happened?

Oh God...

A power drain --

I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?

What's on your mind?

How do you know all this?

Yes, sir!

This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.

The crew? Could they still be alive?

Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.

So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?

Alive?

...you okay?

I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...

Where has it been for the last seven years?

That is not acceptable --

"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...

Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.

Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.

Yes...

We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.

Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.

I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.

What makes you think I'll miss?

Then who the fuck are you?

You know.

Better if I just show you.

You're lying...!

What is that?

That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...

Where is it?

Starck...

You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?

We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.

That's enough!

Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.

No, no, we just got her back together...

Let's go.

What is it, Starck?

We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...

Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.

He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.

There's no one here.

It's cold.

She's not ugly.

That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.

Picking up magnetic interference.

Get them back --

Ship's log.

Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.

The forward airlock.

My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.

Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?

It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.

Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.

And you can? Power it up?

Deb, it's me. It's still me.

I already got it. Everything I want.

Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --

This makes five.

Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?

Go back to the drawing board.

Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.

What do you mean "complete"?

Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?

Girl...?!

You gave us names? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?

At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.

It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.

Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.

It's been changed.

Great minds think alike.

Yes, thanks.

That's what we're here to find out.

Excuse me?

I gave him twenty.

The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.

Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --

Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --

Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.

Oh, I think you already have.

Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.

No. I want my money back right now.

I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...

Sis.

Why can't you do it?

Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.

Why?

Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...

Oh, really?

O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?

Sure. Come on in.

I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

I didn't see you this morning.

All right, I take it back.

What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.

Damone, you gotta listen to me.

She's in my biology class.

Really?

You tell me, Mike. What do I do?

Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.

The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.

Yeah?

Damone! You come here?

Chicken!

No Damone. I don't understand.

You're crazy. Those girls love me.

So what makes you so sensitive?

Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.

Yes.

I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...

All right. Die, Granada Jocks!

Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?

What should I do?

I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.

I know.

What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.

Oh! That's where that group got its name from.

I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.

Climax together.

I think they're both virgins.

I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.

That little prick.

Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?

Learning about Cuba. Having some food.

Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?

Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?

What about those other guys you live with?

We keep them.

We keep them, in case the people come back.

I've heard that, too.

No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.

Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.

Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?

Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.

It's John Bonham's birthday.

I'd like that.

Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.

Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.

Righto!

My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?

WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!

IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!

You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.

They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.

A major!

Naw! Not a major.

You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!

Lacerda?

Not yet. I want to study its habits.

How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...

To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!

Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!

Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.

What for?

He told me he was turning in early...

Do it! I want to get HIGHER!

Are you ready?

Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...

Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.

She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.

Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!

Lucy is looking for you.

Me?

Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!

Some of what?

Yes!

I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.

We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.

Never missed a plane yet.

I fear nothing.

Part of what?

Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...

Spare me.

I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --

He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.

Who the hell would you call?

C'mon guys--

What!? I'm not going down there again!

In the corner, behind the curtain.

The door... on three.

What?

Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.

We gotta try.

I can't feel a thing, Hon.

How much I got, what?

You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.

Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.

Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.

Huh?

Nothing.

Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.

Two.

What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.

What the hell's going on here!?

Duh hickey.

Gimme the keys.

Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?

You keep that key handy.

If he doesn't shut up...

HELLLLLLLLP!!

Get something on that.

Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?

She's not very nice, is she?

Stop her!

Let's lock off this room.

Oh...

I'll do anything to help.

So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?

Refill my drink, will you, Bob?

I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.

I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!

Very fine bone structure.

You see: We've got to change that name.

Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!

Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.

I'm not!

Oh well. I guess I better leave then.

Who is she?

Frances.

What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.

I know, but --

Right now we have to be practical.

He knows, Frances.

Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?

You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --

Fired?

No?

You want his name?

I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?

Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.

Really?

Thank you.

...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...

Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!

Thanks, Dad.

I didn't have much to do with it.

Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?

What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.

Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.

Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.

They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.

Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!

Are you an actor?

Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?

Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.

They killed him. They threw him out that window.

Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.

The hell you will, Harry York.

Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?

That's right.

Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.

Huh?

Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?

Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.

I got your number, Mister Man.

I love you too, Frances.

Oh Harry...

No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.

Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.

Well... you're looking well.

It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...

Yes.

Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...

What'd you do?

Run!

Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...

You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.

I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --

The speech? Real good.

Yes, Mama.

No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.

But what -- 

Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.

Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?

Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.

Please sit down...

And what's that?

All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.

You didn't say 'Symington says'.

Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?

Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.

Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?

Sedate her.

No!

Better that way... for me.

Worse.

Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.

Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.

There is something I want.  A friend.

A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.

I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.

A brain. Extremities.

He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."

Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.

Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.

Is he not back yet?

She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.

Quite a send-off, isn't it?

I wish to be your husband.

If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!

I'm all right. I'm safe,

You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?

As a march hare.

You're a comfort to me, Henry.

It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.

Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!

A... week?

Let it go.

So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?

Despite the lack of challenge.

You disdain accepted wisdom?

Are you a physician?

There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.

Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.

Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.

I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.

Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.

Good night, Brenda.

Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.

Un-hunh.

You're right. It makes no sense.

Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.

Good point.

Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.

They're off now.

Do you have a dime? A quarter?

Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...

I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.

I can't, Barry...

Oh, you...

Somebody'll see.

For sure.

Don't get up. Take a second...

Where's Ned?

That was the telephone.

Sometimes I only think about kissing women.

I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.

Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.

I don't love Neddy.

I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.

Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.

Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.

Girls can't be cowboys.

But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it.

They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.

One night on the town.

Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.

I meant me, my son and my daughter.

Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.

You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.

The truth hurts.

I have no idea.

Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.

They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.

He's running the show.

To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!

What's this about, money?

Come again?

Sorry, I need everybody.

Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.

Scott and Kate.

Auto wreck.

Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.

How do I know you'll keep your word?

Yes.

I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.

As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?

Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.

Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.

Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about "I don't believe in vampires" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.

What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.

Kate, Scott?

You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.

It's a flop house.

Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...

No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.

Scott?

No!

We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.

In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, "Digayo." When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called "The Titty Twister." From what I hear, you can't miss it.

Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.

Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.

Whatsamatter?

You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.

Six-fifty.

This is a private club. You're not welcome.

You believe me don't cha?

No.

Feels good.

That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.

Sight seein'.

There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.

What?

Or what?

What?

They broke when you fell.

Where are you?

Yeah.

Scarred for life, that's how I am!

Yeah, it's mine.

I've been accused of that wish.

Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?

I'm fine, sir.

Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.

Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.

The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.

Across the board, sir.

"We'll all have lunch."  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!

I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.

Motherachrist...

Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point...

California.

Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.

Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.

What changed?

Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...

Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!

I can make this wall without --

I oughtta report you.

Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.

Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.

You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.

Just like you would be.

I saw an article...

Sounds like an amazing coincidence.

I don't know, I don't care.

Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit.

You got anybody, Wick?

That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.

Sure, sure.

Smoke it!

Educate her, Pyro.

Wasn't deemed a threat.

Sure.  Just like your men do.

Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.

So am I.

You knew about us?

The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?

Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.

Shut up. How can you eat like that?

What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.

In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.

It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.

Lucy'd kill me if she knew.

Yeah, well...

No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...

Most people don't.

How do you know?

Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.

He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.

That's the problem. He did.

What do I get?

He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.

More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.

They are with me!

You're fast.

We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.

That's right.

Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.

So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.

But you don't know for sure!

Thanks.

Why do you need that?

Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.

Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.

Makes us look more American.

It's okay. I know her.

Is that the bathroom?

Come with me. I'll explain on the way.

Open.

Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..

... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...

COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...

I had the shot...

Yes. Good was done this .....

No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-

No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!

The engines are dead. We're drifting.

I don't know... It just wasn't like him.

FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!

No I didn't.

By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159

He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...

It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.

Up.

Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.

All systems are working, Commander. ,~ -cc	PINK) -' C -

That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?

So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!

I don't like this... I don't like this at all...

I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.

Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?

Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?

Yeah, what is it?

Hey, YOU want to drive?

We're doing episode 31?

On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.

We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.

Jason..

I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???

Why does this sound so familiar?

Nothing. Hold please.

Turn on the translation circuit.

Right.

Wait... Jason, Here!...

Because it was on the show!

Almost as much as he loves himself.

Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.

That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.

Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.

You have ten seconds.

Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.

Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it.

Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.

This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.

Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these

Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.

Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.

Thanks

It's perfectly safe. I promise.

Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!

It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.

You what?.. What are you talking about?

Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!

Patience, Lt. . Patience.

Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.

What does she see in them?

I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!

Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...

Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.

Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!

We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?

I?  You all know my history.

Yes, my lord.

The British!  These men cannot stand against them!

That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.

Then use rocks!

But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."

Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.

Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.

March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!

Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?

George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.

As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.

Lafayette is a child!

Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?

You invented this, this...

It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.

These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.

I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?

We already have black soldiers in our army...

I understand, George.

George!  So good to be back!

Uh... none just now, but...

I... they look both the same.

My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...

And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?

And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.

Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?

Some things must never change.

It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?

Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?

You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!

Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.

Slavers capture them and bring them here.

It's stupid, of course.

Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.

Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.

Those people?  I doubt they'd think of this.  Ooo, you're wonderful this color!

Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us.  And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature.

Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.

You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.

You guess? You mean you don't know?

I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.

Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?

I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.

The money. Fuck. I gotta think...

Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.

I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.

So... how many movies you been in?

No shit? What're some of 'em?

I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.

Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.

Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?

I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.

I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.

It's what he said, I'm his associate.

I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.

What money?

I'll find it.

Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.

Leo, I don't know.

It's not the kind of thing you do.

Depends. Who's this?

Ray. Look at me.

Look at me, Ray.

I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.

Ray Barboni. From Miami.

Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.

We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.

I know what a marker is.

Fuckin' basketball game.

You just did.

Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list...

Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?

But you work for the casino?

So you don't work for the casino?

They always paid.

Harry, look at me.

Because I need half a million to buy a script.

So what's the problem?

He drown?

I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.

You're kidding, right?

I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.

His shrink's trainer.

Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.

Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...

Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.

A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.

Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.

One of mine?

That's not bad.

Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.

What if it was?

That's right. Three percent.

What're you doing here?

For any movie.

Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.

There a part in it for you?

You thought I was faking?

Hey, Chili? Look at me.

Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.

He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.

Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.

You bet.

I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?

Couldn't find my toothbrush.

Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.

That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?

Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.

I'm going into the movie business.

Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.

Pick 'n' Save.

That's great, Harry. So what's the --

Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?

He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.

Be quiet and listen.

Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.

Shylock?

Yeah, Karen knows him.

Thanks.

Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea. Over.

With that coxswain dickhead.

Sixty pounds.

Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?

Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.

Roger?

Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.

I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.

Gimme a break.

Maybe he isn't alone.

Seen a lota movies.

I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.

Hell no. You think I'm crazy?

You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.

How long to fix?

Like I always say --

The right way and the wrong way.

I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.

It looks like it.

Yeah, yeah.

Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.

Murphy.

You smashed it!

You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.

Right.

There's a charming thought.

Right.

Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?

Probably didn't have time.

Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.

Because of the gold.

No.

Better than starving to death.

I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.

You think she's sailing without a crew?

We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.

Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?

Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.

February first.

Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.

I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?

Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.

Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.

I think I see it pretty well.

Looks like it's adrift.

You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.

So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.

Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.

It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.

We could call for help.

We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.

Drink up then.

The mooring hasn't come taught.

Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?

It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.

Nothing.

Are you going to yell at me?

I just buzzed him in.

Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.

Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.

It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.

It's supposed to be Don Knotts.

As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...

Huh?

Help me what?

You can count on me, sir!

But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.

Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.

In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...

Oh my God, that's HIM!

Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?

Then why do you hate me so much?

That's just the way I am!

Why do you have that stupid poster?

Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...

This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...

Unless they're in your Summer school class!

Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.

Or maybe not.

You lent it to me in like tenth grade.

Oh yeah.

Why do I always have to do it?

I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?

Come on, it's too late now...

I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."

What, is she black now?

You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.

As always.

This morning at Seymour's garage sale.

I don't believe you.

He does that every single day.

I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.

Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?

I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.

That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.

Wasn't it like eighth grade?

Don't worry.

Go ahead...

I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...

I can't afford stuff like this right now.

So should I come over?

I said "great"...

I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.

What time?

Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!

Maybe an orange juice.

Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.

Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...

Shhh!

Oh yeah, like he even noticed.

A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.

Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.

That's okay...

It's kind of falling apart.

I know it's over, asshole, I --

That tape sucked, by the way!

You're late, asshole.

What?

God, fuck you!

Wow!

The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.

NO!!!

Oh, right...

I appreciate the offer but you really don't --

Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --

I really didn't get a good look at her.

I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.

Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.

What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.

Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.

Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.

No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...

That's the spirit!

Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...

I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...

Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...

You must have done something to make her think you like me.

Does that mean you don't like me?

I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.

I had to see you.

Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.

FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.

How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?

Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.

What?

I guess I probably used to when I was your age.

Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.

...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?

You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?

Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.

Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.

Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.

I wish I could see him.

Yeah.

I am.

It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.

It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.

She's not at home?

Why? What did she tell you?

Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.

That slut!

On that pathetic fake blind date.

Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...

Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!

Why don't we start with that next week?

Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.

-malaria epidemic; very sudden.

-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-

You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.

How; we don't know where they are?

I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.

I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.

Starling?

-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?

Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.

Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.

Then why do you stay?

You never had it.

-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-

He just gave me his "monster" speech.

Have you got that in writing? 

What?

You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."

John, it will not be easy.

-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.

That's very considerate.

Has it ever done that before?

Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.

Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?

Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 

Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?

I have to ask- why do you need me?

Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.

And where will you sleep beautifully?

Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.

No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?

We don't have a relationship.

I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.

I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.

Does he ever mention me?

Certainly.

I won't.

Okay, that's no problem.

I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.

Oh, hello, Peter.

No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?

I don't know what to do anymore.

Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.

Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.

Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.

Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.

Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?

Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.

I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.

No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.

Okay.

Command me, lord.

Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.

Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?

I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.

Like what?

Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.

I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.

You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.

That's it.  It's on the bottom.

I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.

Something good --

Who?  Just -- someone we know.

If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.

No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.

We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.

Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --

We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.

Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?

She's new in town.

The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.

Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?

Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.

Huh?  What?

Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.

I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.

Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.

Barrett.  Dana Barrett.

This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.

The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.

Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?

I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.

Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.

Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.

Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.

Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.

Here are tonight's calls.

Has this ever happened before?

Are you Peter Venkman?

I'm not at liberty to say.

I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.

The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...

Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.

What do you mean "bad?"

If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.

Full-stream with strogon pulse.

Life is just a state of mind.

I blame myself.

The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.

Looked at with your eyes.

Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.

Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.

Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.

So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.

Where are you, Pete?

Don't move.  It won't hurt you.

What?  What popped in there?

Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.

Right.  We'll believe anything.

LATER, MAN!!

I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.

I'm sure, I don't know.

Do you want posters, too?

Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.

Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.

You flatter me, Caesar.

Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.

If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.

Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.

We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.

I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.

Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.

Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?

Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?

That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.

You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.

You're hearing about somebody else.

Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.

Sneaking around with your brother?

Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.

Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.

They fear me.

On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?

Well, we can try...

Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.

I was summoned.

You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!

Isn't the helmet magnificent?

They're studying with Cynics.

How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...

Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.

I killed too many barbarians.

I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.

Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...

I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?

I want nothing to do with the arena.

Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.

Yes.

No.

But, Elaine --

But could I just tell you this one thing?

No, I couldn't.

Of course not.

It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?

Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!

That woman --

That woman. The older woman.

Oh my God --

GET OUT!

I've never been to it.

No.

I thought he said by the monkey house.

No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.

Here he comes.

What?

-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --

If you want.

What?

I don't know.

I don't know. I don't know what's happening.

I don't see how we can.

Why wouldn't it?

Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.

Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.

He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.

No.

What?

Hello -- who is this?

Is the doctor anywhere?

Mr. McQuire.

I said -- not exactly -- no.

What?

Who screamed?

Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.

All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?

I want you out of here.

I'm in the bathroom.

What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --

A room. I'd like a room, please.

No.

That's right.

What?

No. 

Right.

What do you mean?

Look -- I think I should be going --

Like what?

Sit down.

We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?

Benjamin?

Will you unzip my dress?

Right.

Yes, I have --

Don't you think he trusts us together?

Why is it?

Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.

Well -- do you want to go up first?

I'll be up in five minutes.

The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.

Thank you.

What?

You're welcome.

Are you tired of it?

Yes I do.

Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.

I walk out.

He's asleep.

The driveway's on my side of the house.

No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.

Don't tell Elaine.

Kind of.

That's enough.

Don't talk about Elaine?

There's nothing to tell.

Then let's hear them.

Benjamin?

You're not.

Now don't start this.

Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.

You wouldn't.

Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.

Then you'd better start believing me.

Where is Elaine?

I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.

What else?

But I don't want you to make up something.

No.

We haven't.

Standing guard over the old castle, are you?

Ben -- how old are you now?

You'll never be young again.

Thank you.

I will.

What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?

Mr. Robinson?

You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?

Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.

Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?

It's Benjamin.

Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.

The pearls are in her room.

Why?

With the pearls?

No -- why? -- should I?

Money -- Ever heard of it?

Free --

Will you do me a big favor?

Then dance the next number with Kringelein.

And Baron, thanks so much for everything.

So alone.

Am I quite strange to you?

And...?

You are beautiful!

Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --

Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?

Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.

I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.

No?

Why do you think --

Do I know him -- I know him through and through.

In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?

No thanks -- keeping my head clear.

All right then.

Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.

How's the beautiful lady?

If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.

Insolent -- Berlin manners.

I did not ask your advice.

Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.

No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?

No, Doctor.

Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 

I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.

Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.

I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --

Yes.

I never danced before -- in public.

Yes --

Later?

Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.

I'm the stenographer.

Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...

Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.

Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...

Should throw a great weight into the balance...

I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.

Well -- you want me?

Well?

I understand perfectly.

You mean Baron von Gaigern?

Here, hold up!

Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?

Why not?

You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.

Exactly.

Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?

Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!

You've decided against the merger?

Next week.

Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?

What a session this has been.

He likes to play the great man.

Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.

Goodnight, Suzette.

Why not?

You haven't time.

The performance -- the performance -- the performance. 

There was -- there was.

Good morning, Gru -- your --

Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?

Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.

He tried to rob me -- he is dead --

The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?

Have I kept you waiting?

I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.

I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.

Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?

You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.

I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.

It'll never happen again. I swear.

I'll loan you a raincoat.

You'll never shit right again.

On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?

Roy? He's always crying.

Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?

Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.

These machines -- They're in here.

I know.

It's not your fault.

That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.

Lead on.

I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.

Oh, sure. Fine.

Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.

Only one tooth?

I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.

He let me live. He let me be his friend.

Get off the grift, Roy.

You don't have the stomach for it.

I pay my debts.

Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.

As though you do what I say.

You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.

Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.

I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.

Oh, you'll live, Lilly.

That's right.

Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.

Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --

This time...

Oh, I am, baby, believe me.

Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?

You ain't seen nothin.

You already went back to work.

I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.

It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.

And when he got serious?

What happened to Cole?

Open your door.

I went out to Delmar.

I saw her.

I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.

I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.

What?

You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.

What?

For Christ's sake, why not?

Bullshit!

Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?

My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.

You up to it now?

I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.

Happy to see you looking so good.

That don't match either of the victim's.

Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.

Charming.

What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?

Toni Blake from Langley P.D.

Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.

Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.

Checking out your place.

Forget it.

To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?

I was trying to get away from someone.

Yes.

Just get on the bus.

You stole it?

Then you come out here.

Yeah.

I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.

Who?!

What?

Michael Meyers.

Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.

You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?

What is it?

Can't you hold it?

Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.

You think they'll let him in dressed like that?

Guess so ...

You can't expect us to stay here --

There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.

I promise.

What makes you think he'll come here again?

Jamie?  But I thought she was --

Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.

Here.  Let me try.

Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?

That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.

I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.

After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --

I'll meet you over there.

Jamie's baby ...

I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --

I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.

Didn't recognize you.

Used to be against the law, didn't it?

You know what gets me?

Oh, shit.

Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?

The hell with the diamonds!

I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!

Go home.

So long, Colonel.

Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.

Let's talk about something else.

I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.

She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.

You know me, boy.

When?

Oh.  I'd forgotten.

Really?

I dunno.

I dunno.

In what way, pray tell?

Everybody thinks that.

Goodbye, Looseleaf.

I forget mine for years on end.

For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.

It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.

What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."

I just want one true adventure before I die.

As a matter of fact--

Hello.

I'll see.

I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?

He worships Father.

He insults him all the time.

Tell me some true stories about Dad.

Uck.

When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.

No, no, no, no, no.

She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.

I can't take my eyes off you.

Make it fast.

Leave a tip.

You're free to go to her, if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.

What's this?

No.

Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!

I don't want to fight you.

It's your house, Dad.

Heaven.

Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.

We thought a doctor might help.

We thought it was an emergency.

You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--

A trip, you mean?

Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.

Ram it up your ass!

Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?

"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."

We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.

People don't use that word any more.

No.

I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.

I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.

It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.

And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.

No you're not!

If he wants to go.

It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.

Just one favor.

Rifle?

Like what?

No.

There it is.  Give it to me.

You've killed women?

Ooops.

It's always locked.

You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?

He's dead, you know.

Hello, Mother.

Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.

Ahh--then she's still alive.

And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?

And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?

Are--are you crying, Penelope?

Would you say that again?

I've never heard of it.

This little corpse is intended as a lesson?

You haven't heard me yet.

We'll find out now, won't we?

Poison.

No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.

And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.

No!

I've enjoyed being man.

Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.

No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.

It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?

Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.

What a relief!

You're married!  You've already got a husband!

How did she lose her feet?

I didn't know that.

J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.

Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.

Who have you been talking to?

That man is your father.

It is you, isn't it, Harold?

He can hardly talk.

Oh?

Doing what?

That's something I suppose.

Something happens to my confidence.

That's when I'll get my confidence back.

We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.

He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.

How nice.

Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.

I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.

What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.

Tonight's the night.

It is?

As long as he keeps out of the park.

That's the XKE.

He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!

And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!

Paul's only twelve years old.

He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.

I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.

None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.

You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?

You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!

Mozart plays shuffleboard.

You bet! "The Harold Ryan Fan Club." Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, "Go take a flying--

Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.

You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...

What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.

I said I just wanted to talk to you...

Wait?

I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.

What's that shade of blue called?

Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.

Um-hm. Live sound.

Do you know where she lives?

Huh?

She's dead.

At least I'm a growing person.

You don't understand shit.

No. But does it make any difference?  How did you get to be the way you are?

You used to work at Copper Penny?

But it's all you do.

What do you care about?

Tod was.  He was with Ratan.

T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'

No, please go on.

Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.

You really believe all that?

But what?

Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?

My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...

Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?

And better?

Yeah.

What do you mean?

What do you mean?

You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.

It's just a name.

Just leave me alone.

No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.

What?

We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...

I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.

Where does he hang out?

You ain't goin' nowhere alone.

Who?

Ratan!

No.

It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?

You never heard of that?

Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.

I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.

You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.

No, Andy. Don't know the kid.

Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?

Oh, I don't have one.

Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.

All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.

And that truck - is it registered in your name?

I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.

Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?

Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?

No, thank you. I have my car.

No.

Well, then, you must come back and visit.

Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?

Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>

Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.

But what?

But we can't just dig it up!

Well, I really don't drink...

My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.

Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.

Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.

I like you, Maude.

Pray? No.  I communicate. 

Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.

Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.

I don't know. Perhaps.

We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.

I took them out.

Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.

Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.

What?

No, thank you. They stain my fingers.

Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...

Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.

Ah, yes.

I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?

What about the draft?

Huh?

Well, maybe one.

I'd have liked to talk to him.

I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.

Another man's life in your sights.

Yes.

Eh?

Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!

Harold!

Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.

Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?

Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.

We've always been here.

Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.

I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.

It certainly is.

The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?

The Boxes. In the House. I told you.

Yeah. The things you were talking about.

No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.

You were ALL human!

Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.

The Cenobites.

You mean, outside... with her.

Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?

"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.

There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --

I know where to find him. I'll get him back.

Is it bad?

Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.

As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --

Agent Myers is your new liaison.

Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.

"Myers", huh? You have a first name??

We're on the move.

Grounded? Who's grounded?

Who?!

Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.

His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."

Noooo! Noooo!!!

I can live with that.

When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.

Don't move. We --

You call that thing a cigar??

Father's back?  Still angry?

Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --

No. I never was.

Not from you.

On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.

No. Myers is taking me.

Doesn't sounds like him.

You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.

What?

It'll go in.

It's just a puzzle box.

Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.

You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.

No. That wasn't the deal.

Stay the fuck away from me.

I have to speak to my father.

No.

What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.

This isn't happening.

Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.

Oh.

You promised me an explanation.

I don't.

I said no.

I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.

Maybe.

There's very little I can do about it.

Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.

It's just been empty a while.

We'll sell it. Sell everything.

He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.

Oh Christ. Julia...

I hear you.

In here.

Why not?

Shit.

So damn stupid.

I'm here.

Just feeling a bit sick.

Sure.

O.K.

No. I'll do it.

What's wrong with you?

Please.

What's wrong?

Daddy?

I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.

Well come over, will you? See the place?

I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.

Never better. You sleep well.

What?

Yes!

That's right. Cointreau.

I thought we'd lost you.

If there's a train.

Are you alright ?

Your father told me you were working here.

What things?

Will you GO, damn you?

I beg your pardon?

We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.

But now I kind of like it.

I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.

Ehh.

Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?

No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?

Just listen to me.  If I said to you --

Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.

You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.

That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --

I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."

No way.

No.  We need the gig.

We're not as bad as you think, Rob.

I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.

Oh yeah.  We got it.

No, you can't.

Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?

I have all of the others.

They always seemed...

It's the new --

Nothing.

On Clark Street!

Why?

He's not worth it!

Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --

I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.

Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.

Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.

Yeah, sure...

Hey Rob.

Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?

'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.

Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.

I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.

You look upset.

We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...

Hi.

Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.

Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.

And do you like it that way?

I don't know.

So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?

Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?

Is what better?  Better than what?

Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?

I haven't felt like it.

I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...

We'll talk some other time.

I guess.

You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.

Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.

I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.

Is that the last of it?

It was kind of funny.

I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.

I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?

I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."

Well, think about it.

No, no.  When are you going home?

I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.

Uh... No.

I don't want to go back.

I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.

Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.

No, but...

Harder.

You're being stupid.

Hi.  What are you doing?

Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?

Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?

I don't know.

Hey.  It's Liz.

You called this morning?

Well she --

It's a crematorium.

Enough of what?

Yup.

No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.

Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.

I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.

And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.

What do you mean?  Where did she go?

I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.

Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.

Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.

Sixty.

Sure.  Ten cents.

Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.

Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.

Maybe he's hiding from something.

P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.

Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.

Sure.

Claymore.

It's my birthday.

I don't follow you.

I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.

You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.

He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.

You had to do _nothing_!

You are.  Now.

Yes.

Yes.

Follow me.

It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.

I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't stand it!

No!

You have lived forever.

What are you getting at, Moran?

It'll never stick.

Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.

Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.

Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.

This can't be.

You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.

Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.

But why be so concerned about me?

You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.

You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.

So sure?

They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.

Stay out of it.

He knows I'm here.  How?

Kahn?

How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?

Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.

Offered the Pope one of his whores.

You're insane.

Of sorts.

It's all we have.

No.

That's none of your business.

Your murder weapon?

I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.

Same.

No.

I'm sure that's true.

Open this door!

Hello, Bensinger.

I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.

Seventy-five.

Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.

My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.

Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?

On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.

Fine. And here's a kiss for you.

Yes, wasn't it?

I'm sure you haven't any.

Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!

But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --

Where'd she go?

Yes!

Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.

Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.

I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.

Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.

You haven't seen anything yet.

Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.

Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.

Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?

Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.

So long.

Gee! Take a look, will you?

You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.

Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?

Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!

Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --

Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?

Look at this! 

Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.

He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?

Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?

Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries.

What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!

Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?

That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.

Where's some paper?

Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!

Where's Butch?

What tickets?

I'm finished.

Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.

Was she? Did you notice?

What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?

I'm looking at you -- you murderer!

Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!

Come here. See if we can move it.

Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --

What is it? Here!

Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.

Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?

That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.

What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!

A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!

Walter!

Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?

You -- you!!

You're crazy. Where's Mac?

Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?

It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.

Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?

Yes, sir.

I know, I just want to give him a thrill.

Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.

Give me a hand with her, will you?

The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.

Three sixes. Is that any good?

No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.

That's all right.

Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?

Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?

You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.

Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.

Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --

You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.

The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!

Fred!

Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.

Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --

What?

Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.

Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!

I was just going to!

Go on -- shoot me!

Now, Hildy --

-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?

I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!

I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.

Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.

That man there!

Don't move!

Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.

Let 'em take me. It's better that way.

We'll get you out in ten minutes.

They're not human!

Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!

Shut up, you!

I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.

Who do you think!

The what?

Yeah?

No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.

No! It's easy -- it's very easy!

You can't bribe me!

Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.

Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.

She and Mollie were talking.

I know.

No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.

Why?

Looking for shrapnel.

They're not.

I don't mind.

Won't they have maps?

We thought it was poison.

Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.

Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.

Weeds will grow, Mac.

You need trees for an avenue.

There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.

Bugger the Buffs.

And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.

Well, it's off ration. We know that.

A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.

Out.

There, there, my baby.

Who said anything about love?

He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.

Wasn't it lovely?

How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.

Grace!

A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.

I know you mean well.

I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.

Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.

Really, that's a long time.

What?

I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.

Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.

Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?

Who's your Daddy!

Where's that?

Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.

OK.

Come on.

Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?

Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.

Yeah, come on.

No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?

Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 

I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.

Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.

Yeah, no shit.

I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.

Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."

How awesome?

Cat fight, cat fight.

And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.

Man, it's already ten thirty.

Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.

Just sit back and enjoy the show.

It won't work.

You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.

Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around... asking stupid questions.

Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.

Hmmmmm.

That kid is one horny retard.

No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.

Tickets for what?

I don't want to see that.

Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.

That seems likely.

It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."

When?

Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.

I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.

No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.

I resign.

Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?

Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.

She looks like she stinks.

What? I didn't hear anything.

Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

What do they call you, sweety?

I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.

Oh, you mean on TV.

Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.

Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all.

What! God damn, how many?

I ain't got a warrant.

Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?

Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.

Right...  ...come on.

No "buts." Go to your room now.

French?

I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?

Not at all.

No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.

When you were a little French girl?

Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.

Not in front of the boy.

No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.

Urgh.

Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!

You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!

No!

I don't know.

That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?

It's okay, Puff.

Very well.

But I like being human now.

I want to be the way I was before.

What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.

Shut up and tell me.

What do you mean?

He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.

Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?

And I think I'm going to.

Ready!

Shut up, you.

No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.

I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.

You are a therapist, right?

You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...

My God! The fork! The fork!

Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.

It's only that I really enjoy your company and...

Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.

I like you, too, Nathan.

I'll be out in a minute.

Do you?

Terrific. Can't wait!

Yes, darling.

I think he's feral.

I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...

What?

Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.

All right.

Nothing. Be right out.

Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?

Your entire body?

Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!

That's great.

Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!

...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.

Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?

Oh boy!

I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.

Ooka.

Yahoo!

I have to talk. Is that okay?

And how do you feel about Gabrielle?

Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.

I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.

Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.

I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?

We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.

All I want's the money.

Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.

Good, good.

The night is two thousand dollars old.

Cash.

The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.

Cut.

I lost twenty bucks.

What is?

You being cute?

I told you. I got drunk.

Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.

Hi. How's business?

Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.

I been thinking.

Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.

How good is he?

Come on, let's go...

Well, I win sometimes.

And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?

No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?

You well-heeled, partner?

Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?

I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.

Fast and loose, man.

I feel tight -- but good.

Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.

Eddie...

You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.

A son.

Aw, Eddie.

Yeah. Just like that.

How much?

I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.

Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?

Hi.

How come you didn't catch your bus?

I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?

What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?

Come here.

Okay. So what's your name today?

I'm not sure... I don't know.

You want to go with me?

Mm hmm.

I'm getting treatments right here.

Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.

When you've got money, you'll pay.

Eggs. How do you like them?

I've got something in my bag.

Haven't you opened it?

You'll find yourself another rich old lover.

Me. It's Eddie.

Would he know?

What does he do, this Bert Gordon?

You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.

Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.

Nothin'.  Want another drink?

Oh, I don't know.

If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.

He went off someplace.

Well, what's the matter?

Please, Eddie, don't beg him.

You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.

Twelve. Cross side.

You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?

I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.

You lived like this once.

We move.  Place to place.

You're not them.

You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!

We don't know that --

Who?

Yes.

Yes.

Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.

They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.

Yes.

Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.

Please.

Round back.

I'll have to go to a new school -- again.

It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.

I was so scared.

Why, yes.  Why?

I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?

You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?

Hide the car.

I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.

No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.

What happened to your other slipper?

The back door was open.

Why, yes.

If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.

You don't understand. You have to leave Washington.

I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...

David, don't...

My ex-husband works in satellite communications.

He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.

Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?

...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.

Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.

I'm thinking.

She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...

I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...

She didn't take my name when we were married.

Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.

What'd I say?

I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.

Looks like they're preparing the invasion.

But Mr. President...

The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.

And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.

We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.

Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.

Roger.

Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.

This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!

My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...

Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.

Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.

Butt-munch.

You know how I like to make a big entrance.

You know me...

Butt-munch.

I'm a dancer.

Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.

I thought you didn't recognize me.

Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.

We're already over Mach 2!

For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?

Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.

Air... water... your "sun."

There is no museum in Iskenderun.

Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!

What is it?

Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.

Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.

Alexandretta. Now we know.

I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.

Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.

How dare he?!

That was our assessment as well.

The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.

Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!

Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.

I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.

I usually don't.

In that case, I permit you.

Find something?

You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.

Lower me down.

Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.

Are you sure?

Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.

It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.

He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!

Don't know. Think of something.

So it did.

Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.

Look, can we discuss this later?

Will you take it easy!

All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.

Head for the fireplace!

...the solution presents itself.

What final challenge?

But what are they? Can't you remember?

Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!

This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.

I was the next man.

Actually, I was a wonderful father.

Dad, how can you?

Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.

The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...

Penitent. Penitent...

I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.

Ready.

Come on -- come on!

Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --

If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.

I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.

You should have been there...

His Highness has not yet taken a wife.

I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!

There are no stories anymore.

Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.

A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.

"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."

Why?

Behind you!

What?

Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.

I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.

Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?

Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!

The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!

Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!

Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --

Somehow I feel safer in here.

First of all -- don't panic!

Just one arm!

PET IT??!!

Keep stroking it!

I know the feeling...

Oh really?

Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?

That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?

Maybe he likes older women.

I've never been so hungry in my life...

Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!

I'm going down.

I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...

No... they won't kill me.

There's got to be another way out.

Not quite.

You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.

You're not gonna believe this...

Don't do that.

Yes.

I just got here.

...I need to make a phone call.

Yeah?

Who am I?

Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!

What are you doing in my head, Al?

Loading a gun.

Yeah.

Why not?

No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.

Still clear. Just a motorcycle.

How do you act when someone trys to kill you?

No. Don't tell the guards.

I don't know. I don't want to find out.

I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.

They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."

You gotta help.

We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.

Go out, take your first left.

With Authority!

You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.

You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.

You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...

We get on a plane.

What about it?

Use my credit cards.

Who cares?

It's attitude...how you carry yourself.

The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?

You eat it.

What? What do you mean?

Try another language.

What can I do? You're on your own.

This...is not going to work out.

Not blue enough.

Who, me?

The blond...GRUNER. A killer.

I don't know what's going on.

Not her. You!

I don't know!

Shit! You're in love.

No. What will you do.

Why don't you get out of my face.

Just stay here and rest.

Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.

You have to! Quickly!

Probably.

You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.

While he makes the run.

GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.

What exactly?

Keep thinking.

I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.

I'll get us out of here.

That's nice.

What part what?

Do what? What'd you do?

Don't give her your name.

Dieter?

I insist.

It's a long story.

I dyed it. We're all getting old.

**?!! 

They took the tapes.

He work for us?

Doesn't matter. Then put him away.

I have a new client.

You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?

What about it?

Oh.

Thanks.

Well what?

Here?

Oh....Sure.

Oh yeah, thanks...

You...him...UST.

I said...I didn't say..anything!

I didn't say anything.

Where?

Oh...I can't. Business.

Without what?

You are.

You're doing...Okay.

Hires you for what?

How often they come here?

No, he didn't do that.

No.

Food doesn't agree with me.

I'm just on vacation.

How do you know you can trust me?

They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.

Ryuji and Gruner.

Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.

Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.

Hong Kong.

He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.

You've  been there?

Can you?

I can't fly it.

Why?

You can say that again. What do we do?

I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.

I love you too.

Do something!

I know a nice island.

It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.

Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?

What about the others.

Thanks.

Tear it apart?

Poor bastard.

Whoever took it does.

She was playing with my Pooh doll again...

She was playing with the Pooh doll.

Instant rice...?

What's that outside, Daddy?

Lowell?

I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.

...fuck is this? Fuck!

Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?

Maybe later.

C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...

Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?

No, no, we're fine...

"Mike?"

Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.

Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...

No, thank you.

Who's calling?

Did you say Berman?

..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?

They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.

You eating with us?

Hardly new news.

What's this?

What do you mean?

How are the rooms? Comfortable?

Good.

What?

You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.

Everything interests me.

I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?

No. We don't do that.  You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.

Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?

Jump in, quick, c'mon...

I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!

How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?

They're afraid of you, aren't they?

The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...

They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?

I'll call them, Lowell.

Yeah, great.

What?

What does this have to do with my testimony?

That's bullshit, Jeff!

I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.

I can't say that!

Right.

There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?

...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...

He --

And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.

Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.

Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.

You want Botox?

Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.

Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.

Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.

Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.

Asian? No.

I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.

I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.

Ruth Rabino.

Oh boy. If he only knew.

Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?

Isn't everything?

I know you do.

You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.

And you've always loved him?

But why him?

Howard is a beautiful person.

It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.

Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.

Miles?

I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!

No. Don't stop.

Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.

Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.

Boy. Boy, oh boy.

No, we're not!

No.

I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.

Did you just propose to me?

Do you want to sleep on it?

In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.

Miles.

I bet.

May I come in?

What do you want?

You can't prove anything.

You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.

You have to leave the house immediately!

Please! Leave the house.

Forgery? Fraud?

Murder?

You have some?

Please!

She did a Harriman.

We do have a man for you.

So where are you now?

They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.

He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.

He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.

Excuse me?

When you have a moment.

Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.

That's her job. You have to respect that.

Well -- is that possible?

Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?

She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.

The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.

Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.

You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?

Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.

Who's "Patty."

I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?

She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children

I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 

That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami  for the love of it?

You were taken for a buggy ride?

A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.

Do you love her?

Why don't you put me in chains?

All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!

Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because

If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.

You're going to finance him, I suppose.

I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.

Oh, no.

On the road.

It'll do no good.  He despises me.

He doesn't think so much of you either.

He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.

It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to youmade your life so miserableand mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.

Is that his name?

All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statementthat you've had a talk with methat we've reached an understandingthat if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?

It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one

Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roadsall transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"

Yes, of course.

I haven't the slightest idea.

But the lady says

Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn As life's corners I . . .

Ohthe papers

Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.

Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.

Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you  scram.

You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.

I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.

Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that

I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?

Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?

I found it on the seat.

You must have me confused with

I didn't ask for your advice. 

Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 

Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 

I kind of half expected you to thank me.

Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?

Oh, this?I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.

Smart aleck!

Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.

Like this. I have no robe.

One consolation; you can never be lonesome.

Santa Claus?

That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?

What are you talking about?

You weren't so bad yourself.

Next week "East Lynne."

How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?

At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.

What do you meanstarvation?

You didn't give that boy all your money?

To New York?

That's silly.

We're not going to sleep out here, are we?

Hitch-hiking.

You're an expert, I suppose.

Amazing.

Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.

You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a carand I won't use my thumb.

Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.

Never!  I'm going in and ask him

Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.

I love you.

Goodnight, Mr. Warne. 

You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.

Do you know?

Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?

Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.

What's 'at?

Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."

That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that

You mean about the Andrews' kid?

To tear down the Walls of Jericho.

Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?

It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.

Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.

When you sober upcome in and see me.

I ain't got a hat.

"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.

Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.

Zeke.  Git!

Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeand

I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.

You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.

Yeah. Just babies.

SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.

Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.

The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...

"Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23.  Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc..."

Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...

Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...

Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.

There were no phone records.

God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.

I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.

Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.

Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.

Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.

Frank, I don't want to hear it.

Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go.

I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.

What's the other name?

The anonymous kind, Chief.

Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.

To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.

Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?

This is Louisiana, chief.  How the hell do you know who your daddy is? 'Cause your momma told you so... You're way out there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and I for one ain't going along on this one.  Jim sighs, saddened.  Bill was one of his best men.

I did.

No, I did not.

I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?

How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.

What was so appealing about Houston?

But the boys told us they didn't get any.

I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.

Dave, I find your story simply not believable.

Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.

Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.

Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.

I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.

Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...

But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?

But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.

If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.

Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.

No, you don't!

Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?

How many shots you say you heard?

I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.

The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.

Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.

I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?

No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?

A Perry Russo?

No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.

Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?

Nonsense.  What next?

Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.

Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!

Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.

Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.

Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.

How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!

I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.

Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.

Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!

You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.

Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.

Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?

I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.

Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.

We need to find more witnesses, Lou.

Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?

Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.

The Warren Commission call him?

You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.

Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...

I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.

I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.

Yes.

Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...

I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...

No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.

...and your General?

Ever ask him?

His name?

...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.

Never touched me.

I don't know if I should talk about this.

And Oswald?

The assassination, Jack?

Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.

Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington.

She's the best damn witness we have!

Then what are we going through all this trouble for?

Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.

That's it.

The job manages to keep me pretty busy.

That sounds fun.

Six.

No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.

Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.

Not a problem.

Who?

You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.

I can't believe you do me this way.

Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --

She almost sounds scared.

She wants to go back to work.

She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.

She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.

Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.

This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?

I'm not saying another word.

While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?

Help you get Ordell Robbie.

What's her name?

Okay.

I thought you might want a drink?

It's kind of a sports bar

I am, as a matter of fact.

So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?

Sure.

I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.

It was the other guy who busted me.

How many trips did you make?

What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.

Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.

I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.

I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?

Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.

For now. These relationships never last too long.

Sandra Bullock. You know her?

She's adorable. But I had to end it.

I don't care.

I go back to work tomorrow.

I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.

Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.

Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.

That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.

He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.

Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.

Why?

Less ten percent.

I didn't say you did.

Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?

I'm just tired in general.

Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.

Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.

It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?

If I'm working, I can help you.

What are you doing?

We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.

Ever meet her, or they talk about her?

Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.

After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?

I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.

I thought you were watching him.

Buy ya a beer?

Keep it between us girls?

Do you got something for me?

They asked.

I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.

I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.

The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.

Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.

One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.

I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.

It's true, isn't it?

Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.

But you don't?

And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.

I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?

I need to talk to you alone.

Well, you weren't supposed to be there.

Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.

She don't know shit about the money.

Two months shy of four years.

Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.

It's a diet thing?

No thanks.

The roller disco one.

You been to Japan?

Now that's over, let's get to know each other.

And your point is?

Uh-huh?

I'm getting out of here. What do you think?

Fuck you. I can carry it.

That's good money.

So we on the same page then?

That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.

Well, why the fuck keep her around?

Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.

Twice. In the parking lot.

Pretty sure.

In the chest and stomach.

How much it there?

You said five hundred and fifty!

The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.

Maybe a minute. She came right out.

That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.

Tell me.

Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!

Hold on a minute.  Where you going?

Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.

Cost you a thousand for the bond.

Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.

Haven't a clue.

I got some more business for ya.

They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.

I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.

Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.

I have a bond receipt for you to sign.

She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.

That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.

Uh-huh.

And where's Jackie?

That I gotta see.

I call your office, she better answer the phone.

No problem.

Where do you want to go?

Home?  This is your home. You're dead.

No! Oh God.

Della?

You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.

Me, too.

Oh God!

I could have told you that.

Oh, terrific.

I'm hanging up.

Tell your mother.

Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?

You need ... a doctor.

We should get ourselves a lawyer.

How do you know?

Her knee acting up?

I thought you said she didn't say much.

I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.

I've seen it. It's all pain.

What? By myself?

There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.

The postal service. I'm a mailman.

It's good to see you.

I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.

Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?

Carlson? Is he new here?

Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.

Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.

I thought you said it was a nightmare?

Goddamn it. I want Louis.

If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.

Where to?

No. The little one.

I don't let anybody call me that.

Jake, you are never out of your head!

Lemme see.

Why you left.

I don't like things that make you cry.

What's wrong?

I'll be glad to avoid the crush.

When was the last time I said a word?

Where are we?

If I could stop it, I'd stop it.

Coming here?

He did? When?

Jezzie?

Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.

I promise.

No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.

Who are you? What are you doing to me?

YOU KNOW WHO I AM.

I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.

Sit down, Jake.

Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.

The Ladder?

Yeah. But not with the Cong.

If you knew, why didn't you say anything?

So why tell me now?

Sometimes. When it's convenient.

I don't know.

Pleasant dreams.

Just relax.

I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.

No. I couldn't.

They're awfully heavy.

That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.

Total delirium.

You come near me and I'll blow us all up.

Help me!

Last night! They were as real as you are!

A long time.

I need to see you.

Count 'em on one hand.

You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?

Nope.

Why not?

What do you mean?

They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.

She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?

How did it happen?

He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.

Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.

No.

What?

Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.

Thorgan, pull us in.

I think I broke my arm.

Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.

What are you doing back?!!

We could convert fission transistors.

And now we're all out of it.

Suit up.

Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.

Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.

Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!

Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.

Oh man, what the hell happened?

Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!

No you don't!

Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.

It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?

I thought you meant...

You?

Oh sure, all the time.

He's right behind us!

Just come on, I've got an idea.

Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?

Shut up, Thorgan!

I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you.

Oh my God! Adrienne?

Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.

You killed him?

Come here, might as well fix that arm.

I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.

He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.

If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?

Nanotechnology.

Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.

Get him out of there!

You wanna die?

4You're not going anywhere.

Old Earth?

Sure, Dad.

You got it.

Two cases. And dinner when you land.

Get behind me, dummy!  Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line!  Wet my reel, quick!

Unbuckle me -- fast!  Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --

What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?

C'mon. Middle appendix --

Shut up! Just pump her out!

Have to pump her steady, s'all.

I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.

Older, sillier.

Love a cup of tea. With lemon.

I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...

Thank you.

Martin, we hired the best man we could find.

That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.

Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?

Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.

Maybe we can save August...

No, we just checked the beach...

Rogue?

Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!

What do we do?

Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct.  I know sharks.

You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...

It's a whale out there.

Just keep kicking.

No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.

It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?

I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.

Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.

I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.

Anti-Shark cage.

Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.

What do you see?

Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.

The shaft is giving.

No way! He can't!

I don't have it.

Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.

You've mentioned it about fifty times.

I'm supposed to be running.

So that's cool with you, then?

Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.

Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.

The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.

Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.

Were we together?

What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.

Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.

What?

Oh my God, SHUT UP!

No...

Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.

Oh, hey Vijay.

Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.

I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.

Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.

Oh, go fly a kite.

Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.

No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.

Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!

What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?

Blood and guts.

Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?

I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?

No, more commercial stuff.

They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.

You know... it's parts...

Here's to dovetailing interests.

You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.

Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.

Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.

You've never been to a dance, have you?

What?

What's the matter?

But you're old!

No thanks. I'm off pills.

Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.

Well, you're lucky it's not you.

Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.

Nothing...

I went to the doctor today.

Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.

Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.

My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...

Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.

Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.

Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?

You mean like couples?

Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.

Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.

Thundercats are go!

Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.

It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.

Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.

Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.

Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.

No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.

I'm pregnant.

Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!

You sound shocked or something.

God, Spermy. Must you always feed?

Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.

Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.

Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.

Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --

It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.

No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.

Looks like it, yeah.

...I said, I like your hair.

Karma.

So you don't do any of those things.

He whips you?

I haven't... I'm a fast learner.

How'd you meet Early?

It's a portfolio of my work.

...That's not true.

What'll we do out there?

Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.

She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.

Turkey mostly.

No sir.

...Then some.

Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.

No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.

Forget about it, doesn't matter.

Who do I have to blow to get out of here?

Thanks. What are you doing?

A book on the warehouse murders?

Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'

Lighten up...

He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.

A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.

I'm finished.

I don't know.

Where's Adele?

...Brian hurt his foot.

Siesta.

...You're hurting me...

You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.

Where would we find him?

17.

Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.

Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.

Yes!

Did what take?

Yeah.

How?

Yep.

Right.

Can I do it? I just broke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.

Yeah me too nigga.

Yeah.

Bet.

Why I do what?

So. You never know when you can end up like that.

Yeah.

Fifteen for me.

Yeah probably.

Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.

Maybe Nasa. I don't know.

Na.

You were?

I like you too.

Nothing?

I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex.

Bang up stuff.

No, Fidget, I...

Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.

I wouldn't believe it?

I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?

No.

But I only had sex with Telly.

What?

A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.

No.

No.

Yeah?

Yeah?

Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?

I know.

No, I didn't bleed.

Passion...

No. I just gotta go find him.

Yeah?

I no understand you. Maybe crazy.

Because he can like climax you up to that...

It's like...

Yeah.

What?!

It's me. Telly.

Paul it's Telly. Open up.

Yep.

It's very monotonous.

It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.

Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.

You are!  I don't like you.

He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.

What?

Maybe you should.

I wouldn't know.

I was at the beach.

I'm positive.

Get off me!

What?

Sit down!

I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.

Find him!  I want to talk to him.

He's one of the best Chess players in the world.  Who better to play a game with?

Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective.  You can't possibly be unbiased.

Just a second.  Hello?

That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.

You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.

Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.

Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.

You like to brag, don't you?

I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.

Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?

Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.

Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.

Thanks.

Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.

Never mind.  He died two years ago.

The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.

Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!

I'm just nervous.  Sorry.

You're losing me.

Of course.

I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.

Thanks, David.

No prints.

I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?

It's important.

And this Jeremy--

Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.

He moves around a lot.  Why?

What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?

You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.

To my room and then I went for a walk.

How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.

Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.

I went out.

I understand that this is just another one of your games.

I signed the confession.  What about the car?

He knows you're aware of that.

You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.

Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.

Whatever's on your mind.

No.

Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?

It's alright.

How come you don't stay with them?

No.  I don't.

Yes.

When I was very young.

Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.

Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?

Of course.

How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.

How could you?  Unless you were there.

No.

No.  But I'm open to distractions.

I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?

Then why are you backing up?

For emphasis?

No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.

Because she killed herself!!

He didn't tell you either.

Are you going to come tonight?

I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.

That's worse.

<u>What</u>?

Thank you, but I can wait.

In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.

You must move away from the Center.

That way. I can feel the cold.

I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.

I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.

In the old books. It's called a glaive.

Reach out farther. Call to her.

Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.

Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.

Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.

The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.

No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.

There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.

He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!

He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.

Let us wish him peace.

The Beast will kill her.

Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.

Use your sword.

Saddles.

Yes.

You will not, then?

A forest near the Valley of Needles.

He saved our lives.

I was hoping I might be your friend.

Hah! You don't know me, boy.

Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.

No.

And mine goes with you.

First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.

I don't think it's working.

It's right behind you.

I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.

Oh, my poor stomach.

The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.

If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.

Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.

You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.

Then look!

It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.

We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.

Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.

It is important to assure the succession.

We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.

No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.

Many have perished in that maze.

The Widow of the Web?

Her name is Death.

It's a hundred leagues from here.

It is not necessary. They will not follow.

It is too late. He has drunk.

The most beautiful woman in the world.

We had no children.

It is no trickery.

Yes.

Of what?

Yeah... How do you know it?

No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.

...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.

Yeah.

Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!

I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  That's why you can't have a bank account!

Huh... 500 meters?

Yes, yes...

I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you!

I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.

Mathilda, stop, please!

What?

Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.

Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.

Yeah... There's a lot on TV.

Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!

I don't grow up any more. I just get older.

I love you so much, Leon.

Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?

Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!

Mathilda, listen!

Fine...

Huh? That's smart!

Can I sit on the stairways now?

Salute.

I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?

Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.

I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.

A couple days to a few months if untreated.

You need a ride, Preacher?

It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.

You do?

You have?

There was no card.

What?

We can do it together.

I don't follow.

What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.

Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?

Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?

Show me.

You can change.

I think it's a different place for each person.

Go to sleep Ellen.

Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?

Not our problem.

Jumped where?

I'm Isaac... I'm three.

Is that right?

You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.

You're amazing.

No.  No... I won't be here for a while.  The store will be closed in the interim.

... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.

... The Grapes of Wrath.

Saluting.

It's mine to risk.

Where am I?

Steph.

Someone should be with you.

You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.

He's getting my sweater from the car.  I said there was a breeze.  I told him not to go.

Hello.

No.

No.

Water?

Water.

Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.

Maybe another drink first. More tequila?

I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.

How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?

Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.

That's astonishing. Sera, look...

Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.

So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.

Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.

OK.

Let's stay for a while.

Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.

It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.

Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.

That's right.

I can't tell you.

Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.

Go to hell.

I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.

Whatever it is -- it could save you.

Did she have a weapon in her hand?

Yes.

Thank you!

Not really. I know how competitive it all is --

Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.

Just the love in my heart.

For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?

Spill.

No!

That's terrible!

She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.

I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.

That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...

Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?

Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.

You think?

I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.

Thank you. I love you, too.

But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?

The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.

Did she do that to you, too?

Wow. I'm glad I met you.

How do you figure?

Maybe not to your face...

No, she can't move for an hour.

You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.

Did you see the icky black color of her hair?

Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.

Is he the only one?

I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.

Absolutely!

Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!

I got bangs!

We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.

You're applying for my internship, aren't you?

You should. Do you have a resume?

And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it?  See you tomorrow!

Maybe she found him like that.

Of course, I do!

There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?

I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.

That's why I think it's time for us to --

No.

Harvard. Law school.

Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.

See?

How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?

Faith.

I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.

To finish last evening's delightful work.

We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.

I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.

We're both of us damned, my beauty.

Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...

I see...

Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!

From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.

Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...

East of Mercia?

No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!

We be honored, friend Ogg.

Dance, Jack!  The night's but begun.

A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.

What does she want from me?

Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --

Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.

Will you lead me to her?

Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.

Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.

And if she thinks me a liar?

Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.

Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?

You do the praying.  I've work ahead.

Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.

Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?

Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.

Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?

Something the matter?

Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.

There's the way, mates.

It bodes evil.

No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.

Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.

We'll trust in faith, Gump.

Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.

It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.

It's what we'll find there worries me.

I don't... understand.

I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.

Did you bring me here to sup?

Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!

Sapphire!

I've not heard a note out of you.

That's it then... the ring!

These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.

Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.

They'll do nicely.

If you like.

That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.

Be patient.

I'll go search for it.

Shhh!

They rival the angels of paradise.

Are you honest?

To fetch your napkin.

I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...

Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.

Then, perchance you'll me.

Jack... Forgive me...

Sunlight... It destroys him.

You're teasing still.

Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!

Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?

Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.

A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.

Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.

You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.

Ask away, sweet man.

Dead, dead, dead.

Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.

Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.

Up ahead!

Oh, but I have.

That very nice.

I wanna be with you today.

Mom said I should.

I love red!  That's my favorite color!

You'd better call and cancel.

Nope.

He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.

I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.

I want you to try something with me, okay?

Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?

What are you doing here?

Your dad's really gonna build his house?

Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.

He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.

I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.

I don't want you to!

Why are you so stupid?

You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?

It would help me if I could kiss you.

Okay.  I guess.

Not if what he left me was real.

Floating to Catalina.

Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.

If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.

It could have been a squirt gun.

If that's what it takes.

Months.

What are you on?

how much weight have you lost?

How's your wife?

I'm not.

For everything.

Yes, it is.

Thank you.

There are no windows facing my...exposure.

My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.

I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.

Why would you be there?

You live in Cory's parents' cabin?

If you hit me, I'll call the police.

No.

No you don't.

Why?

It'll be fine.

And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.

Hey...hey!

Oh, okay.

Sit down for a second.

Nothing.

What do you know about me?

Don't be.  And hide whatever that new drug is you have.  I like it.

That's so weird...

Yes.

You lied to me!

I can die trying.

I haven't been touched in years.

A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.

I know there's an explanation.

She's a little sad, is all.

You let him pierce his nose?

Where is he?

How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...

Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.

Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.

Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.

But you hated four out of the five you did.

Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.

He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.

This was my very first slow dance.

Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.

No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.

I'd rather you not be here.

Going on?

I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.

I need to know.

Left you?

Not a perfect day.

No.

Who?

Should I?

Sooner than the Fall.

Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.

Please don't leave me.

Sam took them to a movie.

That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.

Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.

Better make it a week.

Is Mae Rose okay?

It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.

Not for me, it ain't.

I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?

Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?

My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.

It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.

That's because I've never been here before.

I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.

You're cute. You have any money, Claude?

You went to Monroe?

Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.

You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.

I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.

You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.

Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.

What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.

So you made a generous contribution.

My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --

Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.

The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.

Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.

What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.

I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.

Absolutely. The map is very clear.

I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.

He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!

Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?

Him?

I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.

Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.

The only thing I regret is the day I met you.

We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.

And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.

An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.

Shh! Is that so hard to believe?

You didn't get ketchup?

Yeah? You and what army?

Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.

My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.

Hey, Ray...

No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?

What happened to 'em after that, Willie?

Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.

Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.

Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.

Well, fortunately, I carry my own.

You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.

You should have come by last night, Radio. You woulda had yourself some fun.

That's a long story...

That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.

Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.

Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.

Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.

I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.

And he's dead serious.

Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!

Maybe try the opposite of that.

My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.

Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.

Well tell her I said "hi" back.

She's so nice.

Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.

No.

It's freezing up here, Beefy.

It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.

Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.

Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.

Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.

I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.

What can I do about it?

Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.

Look. You were really high. Things happen.

Sure, pop. Whatever you want.

Yes, Jimmy.

The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.

Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.

What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?

Beast.

You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.

Gotta be one of his disciples or something.

Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?

Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.

You smell like coconuts.

I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?

Really?

"Octopus people?"

I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.

I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.

What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?

What was that?

I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.

"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."

I have to, Valerie.

Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.

See something you like, my man?

No, for you! How old are you, Billy?

Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!

All right -- what are you?

Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.

Up there.

Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.

I don't care... Just get it over with.

Even the alarm didn't wake him.

Well... you can't have them all.

I'm in my party mood.

You? Why? You're already beautiful.

Anybody we know?

I'm very smart.

I changed my mind.

Six. I go red next year.

Thanks... but I have the choice.

I'm going to run.

Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...

That's nice.

Some people say children need human mothering.

I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?

I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?

Muscle? I don't know that one.

Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain

He's good, isn't he?

They won't believe us.

I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.

Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.

I won't.

Do you think he was telling the Truth?

Of course.

He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.

But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.

Oh, my...

For as long as I can remember.

What makes you think so?

Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?

Never, never, ever. Nothing.

Stay? They lived together all their years?

Oh my... I'll try.

No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.

You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.

No, I'm okay.

Yeah.

And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.

His or ours?

You know what I think?

There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.

Me, too.

I can't see you tonight.

Yes, I believe so.

Sit down a minute.

No.

His physical condition.

No.

All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.

I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.

We'll get a tail put on him.

No, sir, it's not.

Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.

What about yesterday?

Pete, what happened to you?

No... I don't. Why?

Not even close.

I... I didn't say anything...

DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?

The first night... Not the last two.

My... My head.

Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.

What are you going to do?

Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.

That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.

But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?

Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?

Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.

Do they aim for the head or for the heart?

I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.

Okay... Lemme clear it with...

Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.

Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.

No thanks, Mr. Eddy.

It'll be ready.

Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?

You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.

I don't know.

What night?

I don't remember... What happened that night?

I don't want to talk about it...

I do like you, Sheila.

You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?

Yes. Might as well - all of it.

She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.

Thank you.

Yes.

I'm a paleontologist.

It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.

Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.

Now you're irritating and absurd!

Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?

All right, all right. Keep quiet.

You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.

You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.

Just call me Barney.

Wonder what's happened to Fenner.

I'll say.

Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.

Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.

Bryant's Utilities - that's me.

Over by that hill.

Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business

Who and what is Shangri-La? You?

How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?

A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.

Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?

Shall we have another?

Yes, charming.

Why not? She's an attractive young woman.

Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?

Suppose she should leave it?

It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?

I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.

Yes.

Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.

Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?

No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.

Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.

Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?

Mine?

It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.

It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?

That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.

You talk as though you intend on staying.

What do you mean if we should get out?

That's what you said.

Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.

Let me go, Bob!

So you think it's all nonsense, huh?

Oh, George . . .

Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.

Yes, the little Russian girl.

She's going with me.

I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!

I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.

What was that?

Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?

There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.

I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.

Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly

In for what?

Where are we going? Huh?

That was easy. I read your books.

I saw a man whose life was empty.

Bump?

You see, it's not a dream.

Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.

Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.

We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob?

Please don't go.

I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!

Perhaps.

You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!

Hesitated, sir.

Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.

Cowan--

Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?

For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...

What happens if I say no?

His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry

Actually, sir--

I'd go with number three.

Don't worry about it.  It's been a long night.  Speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember?

We wear black.

Right.

It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.

Something seem unusual to you about that?

Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?

I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.

That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?

Since as long as we've been keeping records...

For how long?

I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.

With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?

What is it?

They respond to fear, right?

Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.

Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.

Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.

I wanna make a deal.

But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.

The what?

Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.

What the hell is going on?

What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?

They went right to the President.

Don't tell me.  Insects.

Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.

If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?

Is it now?

Can you see the balloon man?

Forget that guy --

Why?

Oh, Jesus...

What --

Anne Lively...

I know... I do, too...

Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.

We know each other?

Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.

I can't even stand up --

I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.

Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...

So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?

Hang on, Lamar --

I understand.  What's the other thing?

So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.

He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.

I go running down there.

I'm fine, Lamar.

I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.

I show a cop on horseback.

Everybody runs.

Run the subscription list...

Yeah?  So?

Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.

Because it was going to fall.

Yes.

Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.

Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.

The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.

I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.

To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?

Do I know you?  Who are you?

Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?

I need your help.

That's great.

I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.

The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.

The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.

He's alive?

NO!

The precogs were wrong.

Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.

The what?

I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.

The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.

And how did Lamar become involved?

The safest place of all.

He's dead, Lara.

I thought you were retiring?

Tell him not now.

My God...

The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.

None of your damn business.

He's my subordinate!

Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...

I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.

Danny, tell me what you're thinking.

Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.

Right here.

Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.

Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.

How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.

You mean after he lost your son.

It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.

The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...

I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.

What are you talking about?

What if I gave you forty?

Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.

Manhattan.

No.

We're in Fashion.

Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?

Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?

I'm ready.

Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.

Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.

Ho's a good guy --

What'd you say?

5-5-1.

Get away from her.

Yeah. Where is he?

To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.

Yeah?

What do you mean 'troughed?'

He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.

That's it.

Pshhh...

That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --

So, that's it. I'm out?

He'll work it off.

Yeah.

What is it?

Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?

Traveling light. I like that.

Soho.

No. That's cool, man.

Yeah.

You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?

It's important.

Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.

What about boxing?

What are you saying?

So?

It's not losing record.

Don't be shitty.

I'm not gonna bring it up to him.

I will.

Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...

We don't need guns.

What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.

Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.

It's not even yours.

I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.

C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.

I promised Chloe we'd come here.

What's the movie?

Shhh... Hello, room service?

How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.

Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?

Well, I don't want to walk.

What the fuck do you...

Sold it, stole it, whatever...

I mean, that's what I heard --

His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.

What did I 'get?'

Like I said, I don't know.

About what?

Back in.

Work's over. I'm gonna party.

You got that right.

Where?

I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.

Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?

The what?

We don't need guns.

Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?

Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.

No more, man.

You're not getting a gun.

Take us right to Kennedy. Now.

Fuck...

You want your surprise?

I'm just warning you, I can't swim.

S'up.

A little.

Cool. See you later.

The videos.

Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.

Why? What I say bad?

What? Why am I bad?

You really in trouble?

Watch it...

Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.

How's it going?

No, thanks, man. We got to head out.

Couldn't make it. Here's the money.

Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?

The Soho Grand?

You're from LA, right?

The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.

Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.

You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.

You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?

But, Max --

When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.

What you talking?

Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.

I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.

Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.

I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.

That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.

'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.

Man, I don't want to hear all that.

Elijah who?

Okay, okay.

What do you do with your time?

Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?

They sure ain't no black man's books in here.

Read it and keep on reading.

But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.

-- the hardest and the greatest.

I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.

No, Brother Minister.

So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.

How do you like it?

There's nothing to talk about.

Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.

I can handle it.

I know.

What do you think?

I'm not made of glass.

We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.

The talk is everywhere!

There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.

I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.

Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?

Is that what this is about? Material wealth?

You have to sleep for three.

Let some of us come down there.

Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.

What did I tell you about assuming?

Is my family here yet?

That's right.

I told you we don't know for certain.

Let me do it then.

Sure, man.

With him?

If she got eyes, she do.

Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.

I ain't stupid.

Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.

What does Sidney say?

No. You'll be marked for death.

And don't come back.

Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.

You hear me, girl?

Shorty, this is Laura.

Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.

Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.

Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.

Watch your tongue, boy.

This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.

Am I a suspect?

It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?

I'm not... easy.

[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]

He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.

[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]

[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]

[So am I, Sister.]

[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]

I don't know, but I know his face.

[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]

[Your brother wants to talk to you.]

[And?]

[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]

[His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.]

It's loaded.

I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?

Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?

What do you mean, I'm here?

Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.

Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.

Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.

I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.

Pinta...

Yes or no?

I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.

Time will tell.

I go to school, don't I?

Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.

Maybe. Did you hear him?

They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.

White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.

But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?

Yes.

The gunshot holds no fear.

I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.

It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.

If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.

Planned what?

I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.

Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.

It's Creasy.

Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?

[No. Why?]

[OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will drive around the square two times. Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to I.D. the car.]

Don't forget your towel.

And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?

Our daughter.

Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.

Hmm?

She's young. She'll get over it.

[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]

[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]

[I should start going for your tits first.]

You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.

That's what friends do.

This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.

And they took that away.

You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.

I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?

Which one was that?

I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.

What makes you say that?

Yeah, sure.

I don't know. What do you feel like doing?

Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.

I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.

I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.

Come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something.  Hello, Ma, what's the matter?

I came to see you. How you feel?

I been getting a pain in my shoulder.

Well, he died. You know who else died?

Well, it ain't your baby.

Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.

I know it pains.

You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.

There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.

It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.

I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.

Maybe that would be a good idea.

I just wanna kiss, that's all.

Please...

We just live one flight up.

Okay.

It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.

Goodnight.

I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.

I'll see you around.

Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.

Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...

Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.

Tomatoes.

Marty...

You not ugly.

Marty...

Sure.

Sure.

She's twenty-nine, Ma.

She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.

Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...

I'm gonna see you tonight...

I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?

Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?

I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...

Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?

You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.

Hospital.

He said it for us all, Walt.

Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.

You make a mean martini, kid.

Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.

We been had.

Call Dago Red.

A native is someone who is born in a particular place.

I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.

Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?

It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?

I can't... couldn't.

Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?

But what about Major Houlihan?

I want to talk to you, Pierce.

Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.

All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.

The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.

An eternal damnation.

You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.

But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?

Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.

What do we do?

Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?

Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?

It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...

Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.

Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...

We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.

They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...

Same here.

Maria...

It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.

Second pint.

Yeah!

Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.

Poker sounds great. When do you play?

Tell me the whole story, Walt.

There's only one worth noticing.

What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?

Homosexuality.

That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?

You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...

You guys got any black capsules?

Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.

Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.

He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!

That's all the commitment you're offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?

You mean who hit who?

Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?

Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.

Stop that, O'Rielly!

Damn.

It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.

Can't. I'm feeling too good.

Hello.

Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?

Look, Johnwhat we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a

John, please let me go with you! Please, John!

Yes, sir.

Money.

How do you do.

And, Miss MitchellI think from now on you'd better work directly with me.

All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.

Go ahead, open it, open it.

No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.

The Websters.

Do you mean the speech you're writing?

Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.

Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.

Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .

What's that?

There is no letter.

There is no letter.

A deal?

So?

John Doe.

The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!

That's all, Ned. Thank you.

Plus a bonus.

Oh.

No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like thateating a sandwichand with a beard!

Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.

Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 

I got it all ready. Here.

Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.

If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.

No, no, no. Now that's too much!

Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.

You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.

Oh, let me go, will you!

Yeah, a little.

I used to pitch.

Both of 'em?

Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.

. . . Tubby?

I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!

You betcha.

Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.

Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.

No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.

Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.  Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appearand in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.

No you won't! You're through deciding anything!

Thanks.

I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.

Nineteen!

That's too bad.

Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you makeand it's all written out for you.

Yeah.

Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.

He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.

You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.

So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.

Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.

Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.

It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.

Huh?

Is that where you're family lives?

Then where's my FUCKING car!

Automatic.

Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?

...a car.

Yep.

I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.

Open the bag, dump everything on the table.

Yeah.

Sorry... Habit.

If you say so.

Why? You like my ass?

You living together?

Around. Barnett's tough competition.

It's against my nature.

Thou shall have no other God before me.

Why?

So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?

You're a compulsive gambler?

I do.

That's okay. That's his style.

We lost.

Pull up alongside.

I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.

You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.

I ain't interested in your life story.

She's the one to blame. Not me.

Doing what? Cleaning toilets?

Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.

Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.

Can I come in?

You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.

If you did, you never showed it.

And it's hard to get.

It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.

Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.

Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?

You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.

Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.

You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.

I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.

Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...

Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.

Define concern.

Your concern is heartwarming.

You let us worry about that.

Okay, I think I could swing that.

What happened to your Trans Am?

I want to be put on this case.

Who's running it?

Yeah, they are but...

Yes, I believe he has --

True.

-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.

Okay...

Because I took it out of your memory.

-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.

Yes.

Yes.

There is no --

Take care?  Where the hell are you going --

Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.

But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.

You've got the keys, send someone in --

It's not used for anything.

Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.

Katie was digitized.

Why would I do that?

Where?

No.

Once they digitized you, they added it.

It was a test.

Way you kiss me.

Sorry?!

This.  No point to it.

Because you'll never believe me.

Activated.

Male.

If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!

What?!

The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...

I've never been this sore in my life.

WHITE TIGER!

Activating Power Beam!

Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!

I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.

Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!

TRICERATOPS!

WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!

Ryan's Comet!!

GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!

Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...

If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.

A real shame.

You want me to place a few calls?

Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!

How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me!

Activating Power Scope!

What's going on?!

But I've never served a day.

Awwh, Charlie.

And a lot more. Can we talk?

But ya got a Boss.

Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.

Tell me about it.

Not another word.

Whatever you say, Boss.

Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.

He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.

Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?

Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!

I can just imagine.

You're sure?

It's a mask.

I do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. Be the fuckin' Boss of all the other Bosses, but we are gonna be our own Bosses.

As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.

We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.

Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.

A million bucks. In the last six months.

So what is the problem?

Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.

I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.

The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.

Who?

What's your problem?

Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?

Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.

Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.

He's trying to make it.

Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?

You gotta plan these things.

They're friends of our enemy.

The kid just called me stupid.

An' Masseria's got seven hundred.

Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?

I don't fuck my partners.

They do what I tell 'em.

You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.

The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.

What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?

You disrespect our tradition.

We were overdue to get hit.

Fuck 'em.

If it comes to that. Yeah.

Kill them! Kill them!

But only on purpose, Tommy.

He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.

Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.

Stu Miley.

Bend over?

Thank me next time you see me.

Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?

Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.

Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?

Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!

Maybe you could talk to Death!

<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?

That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.

What's the "bad" part?

It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.

Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.

Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--

Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.

Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.

<u>What</u> union?

Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.

Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--

We like to think so, yeah.

Well, I'd love to see inside your club.

Well, once you're inside, it's nice.

That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.

That's why it's good you came to visit me.

Mother!

If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.

Aaron?

Goodbye, sweetheart.

Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.

And where is she?

Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.

Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?

Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?

Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.

Never.

Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.

Let's send out a pigeon!

I give that Trail Blazer five more minutes to show up--  --*five more minutes*!

That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.

You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.

Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--! 

Yeah. Some of my best friends are funny.

Good idea. When?

Yeah, I know. That's okay.

Okay--I mean--

Can't that wait, Hubert?

This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!

Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!

Well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say Jefferson Smith.

Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--

Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?

I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!

Is *what* getting me down?

Emma! Will you *please*--?

Why, of course.

When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!

Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.

The porter's got them. They're coming.

Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.

H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--

Mr. President!

You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.

Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--

What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--

Goodnight, Jeff.

Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--

I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?

Jefferson--

You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?

J-Jefferson Smith.

Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--

Did you say--bus?

Well--he's got nothing on me.

I wouldn't know in the *day time*.

I know--but you--you're going to help.

Tonight.

Some committee's got it.

I said--shall we get started *now* or--

Yes, Senator--*twice*.

He did?

In Terry Canyon?

No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?

One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?

Contributions from boys who read about your camp.

Do you want to dictate them?

Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?

Oh--Saunders--

Saunders--if there was *any* way--

Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!

Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--

Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--

Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.

Splendid.

You're not going to take your *suit* off!

Yes, sir--

Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!

Ring the call to quorum.

How's that, buddy?

Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.

That's what he's been doing since last heard from.

Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--

Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--

You're the best nurse I can think of--

You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.

But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?

How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?

Jim, you don't have to--

I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.

Will Senator Smith yield to--?

Order!

Who's that?

Thank you very much.

Would you like to go for a walk?

Yes!

It isn't all! I'd like to explain

Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.

No. That is, I didn't  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.

Really?

Oh. What's happening about the opera?

Uh-huh.

Yes.

That depends on what they see.

I'm from a small town too, you know.

What did he play?

He did?

No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.

I'd like to read it some time.

Are you? When?

Yes, here we are again.  Good night.

Yeah, then what?

Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.

Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.

We're not going out tonight.

Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have

Have lunch.

I'm going to tell him the truth.

Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?

But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh

But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get

Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.

Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.

Oh, yes sir.

A smaller bowl of flowers.

Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.

I wanna see that guy!

Better wire him right away, John.

Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?

Wants to know who the heir is.

Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N

Yeah?

Buffer?

Who - me? No.

When?

Oh, I wasn't worried about that.

I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.

Huh?

Oh, yes. Yes, I will.

A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.

You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.

No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.

Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.

But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?

Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.

I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?

Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!

A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!

That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.

That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.

Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.

Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.

I'm a writer myself, you know.

I don't know.

Don't pay any attention to her.

Yes, ma'am.

Thank you so much. Good night.

Why, I'm assisting you, sir.

What's that?

Oh, I do too, sir.

But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?

What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?

You try it.

Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!

Really? You think so?

I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.

What happened?

"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?

Mr. Cook.

Why's that?

Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.

No, not really.

Not any more.

It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.

I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.

Are we?

My approach?

And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.

Henry!

Not for this. Not me, you're not.

Now we're back on track.

-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --

Doc. Nice to meet you.

What do you do?

You've done well.

She seems very unhappy.

I'm sorry you're frustrated.

I'd better get in there.

It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.

You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.

Where am I supposed to eat?

...so accomplished.

You would have met in some shower eventually...

That's it? That's what you're giving me?

-- Go on!

Sure I can, Lionel.

Thanks for your help, Lionel.

Is she a friend of yours?

We're going for a walk.

Good evening, Mrs. Cook.

Could I see Sofie, please?

I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.

Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.

We'll turn back anytime you want.

Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.

Is she against you getting help?

Uh-huh.

Where?

I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.

Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.

No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.

In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?

You like it?

That's what I like.

That's... good?

Of course.

No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?

Um-huh.

I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.

Anything... just ask.

Will you be here?

It's my bit for the community.

What do you want me to see?

What happened today?

First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --

No again?

You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.

Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.

Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?

Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.

Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...

No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.

What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.

It wasn't the best situation.

Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.

Priests. Imhotep's priests.

And then killing your sister.

Did you say 'kill' my sister?

I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?

Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?

Sounds familiar.

I've had worse.

Why do you like to fight so much?

This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.

Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.

You shall see.

Oh yes, always.

No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.

You will not believe it.

Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?

Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.

I am an English woman.

Twenty.

What are you doing here?

No.

I just decked your brother

What did you find? What did you see?

Oh that's comforting.

Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?

Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.

Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.

We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.

FINE.

What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.

Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.

Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.

Right now, I only wish to join them.

Yes?

He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.

Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.

That just makes you more gullible.

Still...

Read the inscription on the cover!

Um, well, you see...

I only gamble with my life, never my money.

Be nice. That thing saved my life.

OWCH! That's really got to hurt.

And then he'll be coming after Evy.

And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back

You have got to be joking?

I know you knew I'd know.

Fantasizing... about you.

I'll be down in a jiffy.

Darling, you've got the wrong idea.

I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.

Really?

Then Captain Amazing appeared.

The Inscrutable Six?

I can't.

Or even what it looks like.

Sure.

Ummm.

Really?

I guess... Are you always so angry?

Date?

Why?

I wouldn't mind being famous.

Nothing wrong with being a waitress.

And what if you get killed?

I just know.

I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?

Good or evil, what's the difference?

We had an off night, that's all.

Yeah yeah -- and that, too.

But look at him... and look at us.

I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.

Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?

Anybody got any?

Looking for... the TV Guide.

Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.

Or both.

I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.

Yeah, but how do we get to them?

The bazookas?

It's suicide.

General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.

Ah, yes -- proceed.

Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?

I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.

Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.

I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.

I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.

Things are quite serious, I should say.

Any cannon?

Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.

Unhappily, it is true, sire.

What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.

It is a terrible shock.

Come in.

Yes, sir, I am.

Yes, sir.

Oh -- where do you come from?

Ajaccio.

I see...

My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.

The first reports came in at about ten.

We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.

From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.

This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.

I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.

He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.

My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.

Would you like some brandy?

Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?

To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.

You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?

And you, Junot?

You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?

No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.

Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.

I cannot promise you that.

I will never forgive you.

I don't understand you.

Promises mean nothing.

Open the door.  It's me.

Where is Madame Trillaud?

What are you doing in there?

Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?

It's me.

Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.

I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.

I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.

Certainly.

That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?

Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.

Yes, I wrote it.

Yes?

Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.

I did not ask her to go to war against me.

Yes, sir.

A message from Citizen Fouche.

My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.

From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.

If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day.

Thanks, Unc.

Don't move me.

I'm his cousin.

Yes you did.

I'll do it.

That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.

What about the dog?

If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!

I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.

I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.

You walked?

Okay, plan B.

D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.

Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.

Naw, you go first.

I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.

What about me?

Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.

Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?

Oh yeah, why you walking?

I don't know.

Hell yeah, I remember you.

It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.

Better sooner than later.

It's locked.

Okay.

Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife stays here, of course.

Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.

No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?

Excuse me?

Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.

It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.

You damn right that's the big one.

Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.

Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.

Where's Craig?

This is a knock.

Ya'll live around here?

I don't know.

Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.

Bite his ear!

Nothing.

What urgent message?

Good, let's get out.

Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!

What's the matter?

Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.

For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!

What happened here?

Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.

That's my girl.

Business.

Sorry.

Huh?

Oh, yeah?

That's...a comfort to hear.

Ah.

Same to you.

You wouldn't...

Good.

Yes, I'm listening.

Then I have time for a drink.

Tell me why he's dead.

Keep your voice down.

How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?

That's right. That gives you...

Don't you threaten me.

No! You can't! They're in on it.

I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.

Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.

I think you're right.

I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.

Over and out.

I remember. The big tipper.

What are you supposed to do?

Thank you.

It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.

You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?

You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!

Everybody does?

Laughs.

My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?

Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all.

A surprise?

Help me get her off the rug.

Keep your eyes peeled.

No.

That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.

Keep talkin', Preacher.

And I won't never tell about the money.

Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.

She went.

You have all sinned!

A man of the Cloth?

I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --

Now ain't you relieved, Walt?

You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!

Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!

Pearl! Oh, Pearl!

Why?

Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?

We'll steal somethin' to eat.

Hush, Pearl. Come on.

John, where are we g --

That's Daddy!

Ssh...

She talks to herself.

I mind you said there was two.

I'll make coffee.

No. No.

Getting Pearl to bed. I --

Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.

I don't know nothin'!

What?

Mm-hm.

Tell me another secret about my Dad.

Can I have this?

Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.

She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.

No, Harry! I thought --

Where's she at?

How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?

Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.

Now who was this?

Pearl and John.

She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.

Get the kit!

Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?

Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?

Haven't slept, have you?

Slept like a rock.

One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.

I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.

Just checking -- keep out of sight!

Who?

Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.

My dream.

Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.

You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...

You got a sane explanation for what he did?

What?

What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!

Just want to talk to him a second.

You know he's dead though, right?

Sure, but...

I don't mean her --

Krueger.

I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?

I will.

Right.

I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!

Put that damned thing down!

Just sleep now, Mom.

No more fights.

Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.

You should be more careful, Anna.

About what?

Tell me... what else did you have?

What was it like?

What do you wear in the morning?

You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?

Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.

You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...

He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!

How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.

...des raisins de Madère, des framboises... 

And they might believe her in Moscow.

Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?

And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.

How many families live here with you?

No, no.

Which part of the room is mine?

You didn't get legal advice?

Yes, Comrade?

In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...

Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?

Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 

Shall I draw your bath, sir?

Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.

No, sir.

Yes.

Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?

That's perfect!

Thank you, Louis.

Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?

What is it, my boy?

It's a real Paris reunion.

...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!

...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.

Get out of here!

Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.

Razinin.

I'll send you a muff.

I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.

A day.

You mean you are deserting Russia?

Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?

All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!

We did our best, Comrade.

And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.

Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....

Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 

So it's love which drags you to Moscow.

Gladly.

Go ahead.

And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?

Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.

We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?

Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?

That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.

Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.

Thank you. Thank you.

I'd like to say it a thousand times.

The bayonet? Did you really?

I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.

That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.

No, that was restful. Again.

The telephone is ringing.

Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...

All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.

You know I want to...

Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.

Then how did you get here?

Why?

So do I.  Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha!  Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "Yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "Whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!

I don't think so.

Yes.

My darling.

And General Savitzky.

Shhh! Shhh!

They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.

But I can throw it out of the window.

Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.

It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!

Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.

That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.

You can't imagine.

It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?

No... please...

Months, Swana.

It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.

I'm afraid that's what it is.

If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?

Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...

That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!

Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...

Go on.

May I ask why?

No.

But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?

Where do you eat?

Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.

But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...

That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.

"Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?

I like that.  That's a solution.

No, we have nothing to hide.

That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?

Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.

Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.

Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?

Mitchell?

Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?

Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.

He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.

Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.

That's what they're doing.

Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?

Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.

Cox!  Fire him.

The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch!  And ...

And if I stay?

Lincoln used it.

There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.

I don't know anything about that.

I know it well, sir.

Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?

Silence!

"Security" is not strong enough.

Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?

How is this national security?

I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.

Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?

He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.

They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.

No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?

Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.

It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...

Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.

Let him finish, Bob.

I believe you're right, boss.

My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?

... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...

What about the documents he promised?

No ...

I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.

Thou must.

The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.

Black Irishman.  Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.

It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.

I know ...

Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.

That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.

Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.

Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.

Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.

Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.

He's all business, ain't he, Trini?  Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal.  We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...

Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.

It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.

What do you mean, Jack?

He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...

He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs.

... and what do we get for it?  Gobs and gobs of bullshit, gossip, nothing! Someone is leaking. We've got to stop the leaks, Henry, at any cost, do you hear me?  Then we can go for the big play -- China, Russia.

Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.

Why?

Looks can be deceiving ...

Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.

You remember, John, in '48 -- no one believed Alger Hiss was a communist. Except me.  They loved Hiss just like they loved this Ellsberg character. East Coast, Ivy League.  He was their kind.  I was dirt to them.  Nothing.

Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.

One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.

You're shittin' me.

Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.

Elvis I like, too.

There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...

It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.

Compassionate.  Grateful.

Well, we could delete it.

The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.

You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.

Is that the truth?

We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...

I don't want them to love me.

Do you really want this, Dick?

They're all your enemies?

How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?

When?

Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.

Thank you.

The "crises"?

Whatcha mean by that?

The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?

No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...

Who else'd be in your truck.

How's that?

I deduced it. Once you walked in.

You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.

I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.

You don't know what he thinks.

No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.

It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?

Try "old" on for size.

It's not me he's in trouble with.

If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?

The old boy shot by the highway?

That's very linear Sheriff.

I'm hidin' behind you.

No sir.

There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.

Natural to the line of work they was in.

My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...

Yes Sheriff.

You want me to wait til you've quit the building?

Lord no. I'm not retired.

I don't know. Had dreams.

No. But I gave my word.

I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.

Yes. Things fall into place.

It's full a money.

At the gettin' place.

Just keep it up.

Goin' out.

Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.

I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.

I shall return.

I know something better.

I know where it's going to be.

Yes I did.

Huh? Airport or airstrip?

Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...

Yeah? Where am I?

No. Do you?

Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all.

Sixty-nine cent.

With what?

You said that.

I don't know. I couldn't say.

Call it?

For what?

No.

Sir?

...Where you want me to put it?

Uh-huh. Double ought.

Never mind.  I want a tent.

That's twenty-six dollars.

Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.

Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.

You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?

Okay. We can stop that.

Another additional.

I got beers in my room.

Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?

What else then?

I know, I've seen him. Sort of.

What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?

I know what it is. He won't find me again.

He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.

If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?

You do, I reckon.

Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.

And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.

Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?

No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.

You think a woman did that?!

You said a woman couldn't have done it.

I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...

She said she was in Arizona, did she?

You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.

No, I didn't have to.

That's a nice name for what you need...

No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...

Oh. How come?

Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?

This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...

...to see you.

Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.

Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.

Yes, ma'am.

Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...

Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.

What are you talking about?

Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...

But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.

The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --

I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?

Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.

You're late, Eric.

Yes, she is.

She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?

Ad lib?

Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.

No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.

Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...

I ran back in to get the phone.

I got you, Del...

Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.

I came for love...

I don't know.

Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...

You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...

You did? Was it anyone that you...?

Ahh, look, right now's not very...

Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.

I'd slap his face.

Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.

You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...

'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?

...okay.

No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...

I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.

We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.

Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.

Fine. You got five...

Of what?

Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?

My socks?

Hell of a way to die.

IT SURE IS!!

I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?

I wanted to make a statement.

Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.

...among others.

A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?

I know that.

I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...

We know that...

Better.

Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...

Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.

I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.

Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...

I swear to God!

It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.

Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?

You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.

Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -

Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.

Good Lord, what do we do?

What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?

Four hundred, Delmar.

Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.

Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.

I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.

Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.

Assa good idea, Pappy.

Campaign manager? Waldrip.

Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...

Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.

Wipin' little circles with his bread...

Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.

We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!

No weddin'.

Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.

It was in his bureau.

Pete, don't be ignorant-

Well that hardly sounds like you...

Aw, that's all right.

I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!

Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!

Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...

Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-

Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!

Blooey!

Yes, sir.

I ain't never going back to that school, sir.

Thank you, sir!

Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!

I joined the Navy.

Nobody. It just came to me.

That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?

I never said any of that!

Come over here where I can see you.

I'm doing okay, sir.

Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!

Sir, that's not true! I love my country!

Yes, sir!

It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.

Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.

Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.

No.

Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

Zack, don't!

He was. He died.

Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.

What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?

I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?

What?

Well, I'll be goddamned.

Yeah... Mmmm...

You hope.

No. I never feel like that.

Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?

Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.

Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?

My kinda group!

I know who you are and what you want.

I've never had a girl.

I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.

What would you do differently?

Your real father?

Why?

Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.

Yeah. All week long.

Sure.

You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.

Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.

But it can't wait.

Not with me.  Not with people.

That's right.

I have the gun.

I can't...

This is ridiculous...

Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.

That's their problem.

The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.

We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!

I know.

This was your department, Junior.

Can we come in?

Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?

Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!

No ball, kid.

It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.

Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --

Well, I know that now.

Shaky?

"Titanic."

He --

Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?

What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!

They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.

Oh shit Alma... you're...

I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.

No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.

That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.

You know it brother.

Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?

They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...

I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.

Yeah.

Yeah... whatever you say.

Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, "By any means necessary."

Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!

You know it. Stay Black...

Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!

No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.

Cy... I ain't even sure.

Naw... I gotta...

It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.

Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.

Jesus...

Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.

I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.

Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.

You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.

So what's the deal?

Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.

What, I don't know how you mean?

Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?

Yeah.

Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?

Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?

Just a kid.

He had a feeling you'd be coming by.

Nothing.

S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station.

What?

No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.

No.

You call that a compliment?

That would be nice, too.

I expect to try.

No, he takes after his mother...

He's not making light.

Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.

You couldn't have known.

I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.

Yes, sir.

Oh?

Very well, proceed, sir.

And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?

Prisoner exchange.

Probably.

The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.

You're in no condition to ride.

Yes...  ... father.

If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.

Flanking riders?

What?

Granted.  Where are you going?

Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.

I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing.

He left us.

Please.

It's Mister Marion.

Harry, Harry, Harry...

Balderdash!

That's five, keep going...

That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.

I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.

No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.

They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.

How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?

Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.

Four, five miles.

Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.

But father, they might come this way.

Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?

Six-pounders.  Lots of them.

Quiet.

Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.

You'll see soon enough, hon.

In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.

Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?

I will. Come and kiss me.

Yaay!

No more chocolate chip cookies.

You believe in it.

I'm sure you're not.

Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--

Not at all.

Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.

Yes.

I don't know.

Then come on.

The place we're going is on the other side of that.

Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?

Your cairn.

Don't worry about that.

What did we do, Jud?

Wouldn't wash?

What?

It's Ellie's cat.

Shit! Look at this mess!

The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.

The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.

Remember.

Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.

Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.

According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.

I just said--

That's forgotten.

Louis, are you sure?

She.  Goes.  Free.

Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?

That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.

All right then.

Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.

That so?

Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.

No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.

Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.

I want you to leave.  And never come back.

Did you, now?

Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 

Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?

Then why aren't you eating?

His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.

One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.

And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?

Ceremony?

If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.

Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?

Truthfully -- you were a bit late.

To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.

I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.

-- but that was not a proper kiss.

I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.

No, I'm -- rescuing you.

The trees are taller.

Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.

Not when you can drink instead, at least.

You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.

Exactly.

Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.

Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?

That he is.

We're catching up!

Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.

Indeed.

I'll be at the wheel myself.

Somewhat.

Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.

Good.

Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.

These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --

Barbossa.

Jack!

The Black Pearl is a real ship.

Where did he come from?

Bleak.  Very bleak.

Speak.

How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?

Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.

She let it escape because she wants me to die.

Who cares!  We've got to find him! Hurry!

Nebbleman.

I'm so excited, Icarus.

Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.

The trunk.

You don't want this.

So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.

This day just keeps going from bad to worse.

You're looking for a urine sample.

Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!

So, I guess it worked.

Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.

Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.

That's right.

What about it!

And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!

Yeah.  Old times.

Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.

The head shrinker at the prison.

I guess they do.

Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.

You were looking for us?

Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?

'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'

Yes, that is what I was thinking.

Goodbye, Stew

Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.

For what?

Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.

Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?

My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.

I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.

But we don't need it, I'm sure.

Gallagher!

The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.

Your house?

Oh, shut up!

Oh, hello Mother!

Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher

I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?

Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.

All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!

Who is it you wish to see, sir?

I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.

Thanks, I will.

Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.

Oh boy, I'd love it.

A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "

Yeah?

The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?

Well - it's only April.

All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.

Sure.

Thank you, sir.

Quite so. Quite.

There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!

I bet.

Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!

Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!

On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.

I hope you'll be very happy.

It's the smoke.

Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.

Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.

Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?

Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.

I dyed one and washed the other.

Hello, Stew.

Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.

Conrad.

Right.

Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...

Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.

Yeah?

There's nothing sudden about that  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.

We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.

You don't.

Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!

Are the cars ready?

I have. Double-strength!

I beg your pardon?

To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers!

Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?

Joan of Arc! What's it to you?

Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.

Now the lady said you may go

Yes, sir.

No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?

Very good, sir.

... Sex.

... It's a pretty short trip.

Thanks.

Here's my favorite.

She's crying.

Yeah. It does.

Oh, George ...

Um ... It's ...

Really Biff? The keenest?

Gosh. I hardly know what to say.

You want to get out of here?

Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to.

It's better, Mary Sue.

No. Of course not.

Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."

Well--it was dark out ...

Why am I out of order?

Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.

Oh sure it is.

Yes.

Just take deep breaths.

We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...

Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.

To who?

What were you doing in a library?

They don't notice that kind of thing.

Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.

I just don't think we have the right to ...

They don't have that kind of potential.

It's okay.

... Yeah.

Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.

Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...

Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...

Sure ...

No I won't. I swear.

I like it too.

Right. And how did she dress him?

McGinty's.

Ooomph?

What the hell's going on!

But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.

I didn't do anything wrong.

I'm going on trial tomorrow?

Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...

That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.

This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!

I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.

That's your fault not mine.

I'm trying to be your friend.

It's fine, but --

OH MY GOD. Look at that.

....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?

Yeah....? So...Jack...are you stroking that big fat fucking cock of yours?

Yeah? So what are you doing, then?

Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?

I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.

Hey. What are you doing? How are you?

Georgia.

You're going to work now?

See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --

I need help.

No.

I don't know.

Not very well.

Thank you.

No. Not at all. It's nice.

No. I'm the exact opposite --

Ok.

It's Barry.

About six months.

Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?

Yeah.

Yeah, no, I see --

Yes.

Nothing.

Well, it's fine. Thank you.

What?

Yes? I'm trying.

Ok.

Lena?

Yes.

IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.

You left me at the hospital.

You can't do that.

Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --

I'm fine, I have your work number.

Well who did?

You're hand is bleeding.

Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.

I didn't do it.

Yes it is.

Barry Egan.

What's that for?

-- and this is confidential?

I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....

You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?

We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....

Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?

Well I'm sorry. Before...

That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.

Fine, thank you.

I'm sorry.

It takes time to process --

I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.

I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?

I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....

....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....

Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?

Ok.

What?

How much money do you have in your pockets?

What is this, man?

What are you doing?

What are you doing?

You can't be late.

I'm serious.

Seriously.

Don't puss out.

Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....

You ready?

It's fine.

He did seem a little strange.

I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.

My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.

For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?

At your service, Count.

We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.

His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.

Not now, or we're both done for.

Mustn't do that, sir.

It's not even noon --

We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --

In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.

But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?

Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --

You among them?

Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?

You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --

-- and your meat shall be de-boned.

Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --

AND DID YOU?

You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.

Was it impotence?

I'm here.

It's a formality; truly.

A few indiscretions in his youth.

His wife's influence.

A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture.

And place my reputation at stake?

I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.

-- then I've friends of my own to visit.

That's not our intent --

Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.

You'd suffer in her stead?

He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?

I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.

Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...

Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.

I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!

I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.

I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.

There's something else I want from you.

Is it awfully violent?

Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?

The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.

What's that then?

They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.

Go on, child.

Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --

Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...

No. But tell him I would.

I am not a wealthy woman.

It's tainted money, Doctor.

Oh, but I am!

It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...

Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--

Houdini mice.

Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.

You know that can't happen.

Yeah

How much?

One . . . buys things.

You will not walk out on me

How so?

Sir?

Huh?

He personally asked you to?

Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--

You're a laugh-riot, kid.

Right-

Who the hell's Manolete?

I don't wanna write about no spic.

The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.

Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.

Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.

Don't do this

Don't do this

And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -

They don't have to.

No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?

Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--

So they're Jews. . .

Christ.

And they went to the stockholders in New York.

Thank you-

And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.

Again

Jesus

When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.

Then find another theater

You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!

It's just that my movie is so-

I know what you want but it can't be done!

About what?

For what?

Tommy, thanks for coming over.

Yeah, I understand, Tommy.

And where you goin'?

I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.

Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.

You wasn't with her, were you?

I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.

I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...

You want the title shot?

You want the title shot or not?

I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...

What do you mean?

I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?

Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.

Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.

Did Salvy fuck Vickie?

You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...

Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.

I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.

What?

Whadda ya mean?

Whatsa matter with you?

Does that mean...

You sound bitter.

Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?

What time is it?

Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.

You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.

Should I hit it?

It's OK.

Who asked you?

Who asked you?

I'm not interested in him.

Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?

Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.

I'm leaving you Jake.

I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.

Never felt better.

I'd tell you to bet a bundle.

Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.

Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?

Excuse me for living.

I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?

You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.

That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.

Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.

Didn't you take it to the crime lab?

Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.

What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?

Ever get an answer?

Mrs. Thorwald.

Your logic is backward.

Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --

Your Lisa?

Like what?

A possibility.

You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"

Where'd they take Lisa?

If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.

Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.

Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.

You did.

Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.

The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?

I only have a hundred dollars or so.

No.

Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!

Well, I only quote from the best.

I don't want to.

Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.

People with sense can belong wherever they're put.

Get back there! He'll see you!

And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.

There's something buried there.

Look!

You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.

Got a shovel?

Uh-huh.

Only because it's expected of her.

It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.

Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.

How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?

For what?

She's not in love with him -- or any of them.

No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.

All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --

You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --

Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?

Three.

You mean "goodnight."

Without any future?

Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.

I have one now.

Tell me about it.

You'd better before you catch the disease!

I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?

Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?

Don't you see how silly you're being?

He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --

Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --

Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --

You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?

Who was the trunk addressed to?

No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.

Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --

Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --

Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?

What?

Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?

Hang loose.  We got all night.

Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?

I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.

Well, now--

She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!

You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?

And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.

You don't?

Go on--Give 'em to your friends.

Really, Frank?  When was that?

Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--

Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?

Look--just relax, will you?

I still think you should go down.

Where's your mother tonight, Plato?

I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?

Jim.  What's yours?

I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?

They're still there!

My personality's showing again. Should I leave?

How'd you find me?  What's happening?

Judy.

Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for the summer.

Hey!  How 'bout that!

Who?

I've got a gun.

No.  At dawn.

We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.

Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?

Goodbye, dear.

Good Lord!

I don't know why--!

But you don't think that's a solution.

What?

Chicken?

Listen--

"Life is crushing in on me."

Dig the square wardrobe!

No.

I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.

So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?

I feel as if I'm walking under water.

Hi.

You don't need to do that.

It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.

Yes.  My best friend.

Talk to them!  Heavens!

It's all right.

He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!

We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.

We were romantic then too--

GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!

Don't hurt him...

To all those cons...

One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.

I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?

Yeah.

No, no --

What.

Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.

Yes it was all you --

You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.

Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?

We could live it up and --

What the fuck is going on.

Nick, what are you --

He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.

Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --

They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.

No. He wants to be working for himself someday.

They're truck drivers.

There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.

Nick, the ice is --

I'm almost done.

You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?

Is there any way you could get into his truck?

Rudy. How'd you know my name?

I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --

You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!

Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.

You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!

Yes!

Samantha.

Bam Bam.

What college.

Her brother.

Five million?

And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?

This isn't the Tomahawk.

I'm gonna need some money.

...ttt..tt... two out of three?

What's the code?

We got five. Putting Ashley outside.

You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.

Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.

How'd you know my name.

Leave the tree.

Show's over.

That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?

My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.

Five years. Since it opened.

He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.

You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.

Oh, man --

Ain't there yet.

Yeah.

I'm just talking.

Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.

Thought you hated Sidnaw.

Alamo...

No, man! No, no, no!

How'd you know I'd do it.

Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember

Well...sorry...

I'M NOT NICK!

Thanks, don't mind if I do.

Yes.

You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -

No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.

Who?

It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.

Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.

So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.

I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.

I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.

It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."

What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.

Yeah.

Did the two of you talk?

Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.

You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?

I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...

What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?

Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.

Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.

Bad luck. What's the exposure like?

Mr. Pink.

I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.

Shit. I don't remember that at all.

Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.

Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.

You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.

All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.

I'm okay.

It's not good...

I can' take you to a hospital.

Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?

Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?

Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?

Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?

Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.

Why not?

The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.

I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?

Uh-uh, just cops.

That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?

What do you think?

You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -

How can you be so sure?

He ain't dead.

Well, he knows a little about me.

He asked.

Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.

Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.

Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?

I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.

The who?

I'll make the soap myself.

You're not going out to look for them?

Why do you think?

Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.

Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.

Maybe they will.

Goodbye, Mary.

I haven't got the job yet.

So did I. They were in it.

Hello, Miss Wells.

Which ranch?

The thing to do is stick to rabbits.

He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?

Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.

That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.

Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.

Three men on matched roans?

What's there to be fair about?

I'm sorry. Let's go.

If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.

Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.

Just a thing I was workin' on.

You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?

Well, say it.

Yes, people make me restless.

Go ahead.

And we're running out of that.

How many ways can a man say no.

Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.

That's it then.

I don't care what he thinks.

Stop it --

Where is he?

He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.

Yeah, we sure have.

Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.

Put on another one.

Why not? You went farther than that last time.

That's the end of the line.

Without someone to teach you, it's tough.

Unicorn -- a kind of animal --

Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.

Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?

You were supposed to be reading words.

But you're his brother.

Thanks, Steve.

Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.

Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?

Never happened!

Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.

You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?

Okay.

Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.

But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.

No, stay.

Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.

He's so brave.

I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.

Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.

Great!!!

No. Keep rubbing.

No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.

Listen to me I --

Oh.

Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!

I don't care. You pick.

Yeah, I broke my fall.

Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.

Not in a thousand years.

I don't need your help.

Just wait, you'll see.

Quick, everyone to the lab.

I don't know, but I sure hope so.

Gear. You know, clothing.

Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?

Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.

I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.

What's this?

How are we going to get them all up there?

Yes, I thought that it would be best.

Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.

Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.

Well, there's a lot riding on this project.

Second best.

What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.

My help?

Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.

Soon. First, I must bless this house.

Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?

I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...

"Fucked me."

It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 

Mother? 

I certainly did not.

"Serial Mom"?  WOW!

She sure can pick 'em!

Oh Mom...

God, Mom!  What's the matter?

Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.

Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...

Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?

Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?

I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!

You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!

Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know. No wonder Dede's hungry. It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore.

Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.

NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!

Is this the Cocksucker residence?

Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?

It's not fair!!

I certainly was not!

You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles!  I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  The prosecution rests, your honor.

We all have bad nights. 

Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 

Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?

Watch the booth! I'll be back! 

But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!

Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.

Right here!

I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?

That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.

Nice one, huh? Winter's coming.  Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...

Yeah - sure.

You can?

Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -

No.

I'd like to get out of here.

It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.

Thank you.

Yes.

You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?

I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.

I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.

But I like teaching school.

She seems rather an odd woman to me.

I guess most people are.

I ought to know.

She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.

No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.

He was a kind little man in his way  and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.

A job?

There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?

You'd love that, Jackie. Remember that last summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener.

Gregory   you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.

Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.

Not from me.

I'm afraid.

Good-bye.

But you're always at the library.

I don't think that's so revealing.

It's all clear to me now -- so clear.

But it's a small room, Jason.

Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.

They may have been friends of hers.

Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.

I've lost my knack.

Uhhuh.

Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet 	one as a detective.

It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.

Perhaps

It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.

I don't know.

Yes. There are certain punitive measures...

I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!

Unless what?

No. She's no longer under my care.

We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.

I never thought you did.

You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?

And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.

Yes  and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline.

Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.

Why?

I don't believe it.

No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.

Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?

I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."

Oh, no problem. It can wait.

Television?

Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.

Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.

Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.

Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.

I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.

Who's Elizabeth?

No.

It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.

Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.

I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.

Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...

You had sex with you therapist?

That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?

Who's Donna?

All of these are interviews?

Why not?

It won't. Are you ready?

When we're making love?

Absolutely not.

Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?

If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.

You said you weren't always impotent.

So you have had sex.

So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?

So you lied to her?

I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.

I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...

I'm babbling.

I'm not in love with you.

That's very flattering.

But I don't understand --

No.

Not entirely.

Yes.

I don't care.

No.

You did that?

Mmmmm...

That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.

Who'd you have lunch with?

Well, are you?

If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.

I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.

Always the lawyer.

I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...

Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.

I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.

Yes!

Yes.

I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.

Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.

About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.

So it was recently that you tried this.

Radon leakage?

Did you find him attractive?

Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?

You know what. You say it just to irritate me.

Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.

I have a pretty good idea.

I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.

Will you stop? Jesus.

What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?

Well. I can't stay.

Okay.

I'm Cynthia Bishop.

I'm Ann Millaney's sister.

She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.

What do you get?

Why don't you let me tape you?

That's all.

Yes.

That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.

Whichever you prefer.

My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?

I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.

Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.

No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?

It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.

Is that what he tells you?

Hi.

Now who the hell is going to do that for me?

So make an exception.

I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.

Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?

Oh.  Well, when, then?

Cynthia. John.

Right.

You told Ann about this?

You trust him.

It hurts that you would say that to me.

Graham.

Will you lease month-to-month?

I like having the car, the car is important.

Or go someplace in a hurry.

So is my wife, asshole!!

Brian Kirkland, please.

Anyway, I've always said, the work is the thing. I can be happy without a marriage, but take away my work, that's different. And if Ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what I'm saying? I mean, fuck.  Jesus, what's takin' this guy?

Yes?

Yes.

No, nothing.

Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.

That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.

A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...

I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.

I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.

Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.

Nick, you're so strange...

Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?

You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.

Did I say anything?

That you, Rog?

No? How come?

It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'

OK, Rog. See you at ten.

YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME

BREAKING OUT

BREAKING OUT

Good!  I'm gonna be there.

A wreck.

What?

I've caught it once or twice.

They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.

No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.

Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.

I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?

Yes, Betty.

It pays to know your way around, Oliver.

Indulge?

No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!

SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION

YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE

YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE

SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT

TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`

Absolutely correct.

You're practically naked!

I'm sorry, Officer.

Thanks Officer Park...Vance.

No...couldn't I do this later?

There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.

But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?

Farley!

Fast!

Foods!

We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.

LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS

Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.

I love you.

Bottle.

I'm good.

I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.

Me too.

You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!

No, I'm an actor.

I can't help the traffic.

Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.

Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.

It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.

Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.

And Lexapro, yes.

I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?

Let me call Christine.

Now we're talking.

So you're going to stop acting?

Then it's a good thing.

Pour us a couple.

You know that chick?

She is very hot.

This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.

Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.

So what's the plan today?

About a month ago. Six weeks.

Okay! Fuck!

She's been leaving messages here too.

Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.

Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.

Nope.

Nope.

Could be anything.

Shut up.

I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.

What exactly are we going to do?

Put me down, Jack.

No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.

Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.

Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?

Huh. Let me think.

Uh-huh.

I don't know. I wouldn't know.

You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?

Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.

Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.

My ankle. Just go explain the situation.

Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.

Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.

You need a new car anyway.

See you.

I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.

I know. I love that.

Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.

Hey.

Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?

Yeah, I know.

Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.

Yeah.

Got it.

Great. What's the latest we can get there?

Okay.

But you wanted to fuck me first.

Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?

Oh, Miles. You're drunk.

A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.

Ken.

I am.

I guess.

Quaffable but far from transcendent.

Exactement!

Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.

You golf?

And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.

Only for pee or poop.

Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?

She doesn't answer me either.

No dad!

That's weird.

It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...

Curse and stuff.

Yes it was.

Yes, it was.

Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?

I got him.

The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.

They already know we're here.

What are you doing?

I'm close.

We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.

That means they're unemployed.

Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.

Don't yell at her!

You're scaring your sister.

Yeah baby. I think someone did.

Don't call me Father.

Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.

The footprints.

What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?

He definitely wasn't a midget.

You take care of yourself...  Graham.

You'll lose the signal!

That's why they got you in jail?

What friend is that?

It was my fault.

Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.

Yeah... maybe. So long.

I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.

I just came out to say goodbye.

Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.

Didn't Paden tell you that?

Yeah... that must have been it.

This is a brutal land.

That I do.

I had to get up anyway.

Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.

I expect.

You haven't got any money.

Anybody got any ideas?

I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. But I never thought it'd be my boy. I never thought that.

She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.

The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.

I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.

I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.

Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.

His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.

I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.

What now?

All I did was kiss the girl.

I'm done talking. Get out.

We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.

Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.

Because they enjoy it.

Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.

Luck, I guess.

You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.

It is that.

Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.

So we understand each other?

He left me.

I don't want you to get hurt.

No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.

No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.

I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.

It sounds like you still have feelings for him.

We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.

Please.

How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.

"Forever".

She'll drive herself.

Better late than never.

You really think so?

Soon.  Soon.

-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!

I do?

Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...

No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.

Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.

No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?

... so much like her?

Yes, call me Simone.

Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...

We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.

And what may I ask brought this on?

Clyde.

Really?  She didn't mention it.

Body double.

Why not?

How did the wall get there?

I know what you mean.

You want me to call Security?

Good for you, Hank.

I've seen them all before.

-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?

Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?

Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.

I love you too, daddy.

Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?

Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.

I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.

I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.

-- I bet you have.

Maybe he's talking to himself.

24-hour tail on Taransky?

You're in breach.

I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.

You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?

I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?

Good morning, Mr. Taransky.

Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.

You know what I'm talking about.

Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.

Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?

Thanks.

They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.

Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?

I don't tell her a thing.

That I'm a freak.

I don't know.

When?

Yes, I am.

No, we're not.

Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...

Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?

No.

You do?

I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.

Don't get mad.

Maybe.

Yeah.

They did?

They scare me too sometimes.

S-ssssstop it!

I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.

How'd he know I'd come?

Meaning?

What are you talking about?

Chicken blood on the crops.

What's a "little while?"

Nope.

You were a beat and a quarter behind.

Tramp.

The band.

You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?

He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.

Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."

Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?

Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.

Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.

I thought you said two hundred.

Metaphysical question, man.

Harvest moonshining!

Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?

Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.

Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.

Pardon?

I --

I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?

Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.

What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!

Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!

Bzzzzzzzzzt!

Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.

Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.

Yeah?

Let it go.

Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --

It's you. You and your father.

Like what?

It's coming right up. After the third verse.

Us? We been... moonlighting.

Bill, we need to talk!

Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.

I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.

No. What?

Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.

I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?

I'm sorry.

Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.

Yeah. Good.

You took Bill.

Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...

The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.

I got to leave my post.

Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.

All the rib eyes?

Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.

Out.

Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.

Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?

You paying for the gas?

Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.

I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.

Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.

I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.

It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.

Okay.

Shoot.

Enjoy your Kenworth.

I would've come back for you.

Like what?

Do I know? I'm an authority on it.

Ummm?

Bandit II?

Well, thanks for the lift.

Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.

You gotta admire the man's determination.

That's me.

No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.

Go.

Yeah?

That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.

Can a pig whistle?

They're jammed!

Not for long, you ain't.

I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.

I'm at marker eight-five.

I ran into complications.

Then don't.

Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?

We're gone.

I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.

We'll be waiting. Over.

What's your twenty and what's your handle?

See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.

Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.

About one to five years worth.

Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.

I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.

Believe me, that won't be a problem.

Where the hell are you?

Then it must be a helluva idea.

Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.

Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.

And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.

What kind of personnel?

Of course. Yes.

And a very bad gamble.

You shot me and murdered my friends.

Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.

Damn... alright then.

Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.

I sent Hugo, he should be there!

The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.

I said I got his machine.

Look at the collar on that coat...

...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?

I thought Heller was a double op?

You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?

This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?

What are you doing here?

-- will be handled back in --

It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.

But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?

Yeah... Sid?

Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.

Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.

Yeah... Sid?

Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.

Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?

-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.

Got hit twice.

I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.

'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.

'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.

...What are they doin' right now...?

What do you want?

We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.

She reappeared exactly as she had before?

Why did you agree to come here?

How quickly?

What?

And professionally?

I wish you'd told me.

Why?

-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.

Not necessarily.

Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.

I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?

Get out --

Yes.

I love her.

I won't be making the trip.

Why?

Book?

You didn't look very happy.

Stop it.

I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.

What kind of look?

I did too.

I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.

You... she said I didn't love her.

Don't debate him; he'll say anything.

Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.

How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.

You're lying.  I'm not human.

Who are you, then?

Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.

It's an experiment.

Hello, Win.

Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.

I came on at 8:00.

Sooner, the better.

Urdu and Hindi.

Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.

You don't like him, do you?

Tell it like it is.

He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.

Sleep good.

No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...

Claire...!

They called here after you left...

Oh God, that's great!

Yeah.

... Don't explain.

Yeah...

Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --

What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!

Sure we are, let's go!

Too kinky.

Well, actually, she looks better than that.

Why?

No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?

She bought it.

What about Tommy?

No, I need'm now!

Ever shot anyone?

Does it make you... hard?

Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.

She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.

I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.

Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...

What the fuck you doin'?!

Yeah, I think so.

Shooting?

I don't think she can sing, either.

Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.

Uh, Uncle Ben, I--

No. No, that's okay.

Nonot really.

I know.

I was sort of hoping to get out of--

Come on, laughter's the best medicine!

They'll never take me alive.

Don't be pitiful.

Get away from me, freak!

You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--

Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know, sexy stuff.

Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.

A spider.  Eight legs.

Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.

When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.

He knew.

Even if they're not clever.

I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.

Thank God.

Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.

That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.

You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?

So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...

Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.

Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?

Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.

And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--

I know him.

It'll shut itself off.

Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.

It's fine.  Tell me what--

Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?

Power down.  I need to talk to you.

This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!

I don't care.  Cretin.

Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.

All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.

An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...

I'll try. Thanks.

Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.

No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.

I just gave-- yeah, sure.

Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?

And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?

Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.

Is you all good Nazis?

Any news on Dunbar?

There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?

Just pulled the old match gag, see!

Static!

I don't know anymore.

Who is it?

Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.

You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.

Thanks.

We're looking at it.

How much more do we have to take from him?

Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.

You are talking crazy!

Not you.

That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.

No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.

I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.

All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.

Isn't it?

Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.

Stop it, Harry!

I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.

Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!

Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!

What's the award?

Where'd that come from?

He's the grrrrreatest!

Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!

Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!

Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.

So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.

This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!

Hey, here's Esther Williams.

There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!

Why, sure!

Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?

Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.

I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.

Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.

Good.

You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.

Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.

One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.

Come on, everybody!  Let's go!

Go on, Sefton -- butt out!

You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.

With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?

I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.

Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.

Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?

What's the decoy?

Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.

You can tell Father Murray to --

They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.

What about the radio?

Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.

The Germans know where Dunbar is.

Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?

Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.

All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.

How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?

Here. Take them.

Not particularly.

Yeah. We were just passing out guns.

Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!

Just don't drool on it.

Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?

Oh! Somebody was peeking!

Maybe those Russian dames would take him.

Where is he?

Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.

It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.

I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.

It appears to be a magnetically sealed.

I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.

All hands, brace for impact!

The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.

What happened to you?

Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.

Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.

I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.

I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?

I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.

I hadn't planned on it.

Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.

It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.

Phasing? To where?

No.

Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.

Yeah, they're full of great ideas.

Bad food, brutal discipline.  No women.

Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.

Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"

My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.

Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?

Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.

Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.

Aye, sir.

Put me on the hailing frequency.

Soon, Captain... Quite soon.  

An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...

I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.

Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.

Aye, sir.

Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?

Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.

Locate.

What is it?

I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --

Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --

... Fascinating.

I'll handle that later.

Logic indicates that is the case.

I have already made one transmission too many...

... How long?

It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.

Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.

"... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger." I know the book, Saavik.

Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.

Scan for vessels in pursuit!

Just him, sir!

Goodbye, David.

FULL IMPULSE POWER!

What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?

I think it's an energy form, sir...

Go, Sulu!

It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!

No, sir, no response.

Oh, I'll have "Mr. Adventure" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous.  All my hopes.

Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.

Any time.

Who is this?! How dare you --



All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.

I will speak with you alone, Kirk.

Yes...

... Yes...

... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.

One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.

Yes, my lord!



You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.

Good for you, Lieutenant.

I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --

But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.

I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...

As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.

He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.

Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.

And almost got tossed out of the Academy...

En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?

Carol!

I know, I know...

Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.

Mother, go back!

Go back. I'm going to kill him.

I saw it -- !

Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?

I see. Helmsman?

<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --

Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.

Is that what you came here to say?

Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.

Listen to me -- you men and women --

Aye, sir --

I'm going down to the station.

I'm trying, sir. Stand by...

Sensors, Captain?

No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.

Admiral, this is Spock.

Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?

The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?

To be sure, Captain.

Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.

You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.

That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.

Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?

And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...

... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?

She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.

I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.

As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.

Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.

Phasers on stun. Move out.

Power levels quite low, sir.

Engage warp engines --

Trying, sir!

Scotty!

Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...

You are half human. The Computer knows that.

I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.

Back home, we call him the miracle worker.

Mr. Sulu... Take us home...

If you have a better idea - now's the time.

Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.

... My shoes...

I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.

... My God...

Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.

"Guessing" is not in my nature...

Reading the patient's vital signs.

Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.

I have the coordinates of the reactor...

It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.

I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.

That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?

Shields, aye.

Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:

Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.

We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...

I was not.

Go ahead.

What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.

We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.

Just lucky, I guess.

See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.

You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.

Tell me when the whales are going to be released?

Who do you think I am?

All right. The truth?

You want the details?

Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.

Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?

Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.

What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...

You need me.

He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.

Why does it have to be goodbye?

To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.

As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.

The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.

Surely you can be more specific...

What are the variables...?

You've programmed that from memory...?

And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?

Yes?

I see.

Exaggerate.

In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.

Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.

Steady as she goes...

... Aye sir...?

We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.

Go, Mr. Sulu.

Aye, sir!

Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...

Yes, sir.

Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.

Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.

Mr. Scott -- how soon?

Humpbacked - people.?

Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.

Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.

Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.

Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?

Mr. Sulu, if you please.

Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?

Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President.

Millions?

Well, that's different.

That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.

... Are you joking?

Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?

I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.

It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.

Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.

Why?

Then you must spend your life answering questions.

Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...

To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.

We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...

It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.

You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.

You're what?

Perhaps, that is true.

My power cells continually re- charge themselves.

Androids... don't have...fun.

It is safer there. I will join you shortly.

They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.

Yes. But look at this medscan...

Captain, Geordi...?

It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...

How about a passive radiation scan?

I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...

It is not over.

This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...

You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?

... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...

How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?

Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?

Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...

Do you know how to disable the injector?

The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...

So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.

... had regenerated.

I'll be in Engineering.

You got me, Commander.

Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.

Options?

If it works you mean.

Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...

Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...

Remind me to lodge a protest...

Commander Riker...

So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?

We're not going anywhere.

Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...

We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.

The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...

Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...

Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...

Transferring controls to manual.

Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...

We have to find shelter...

Say the greeting again...

I look forward to reading your report.

I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.

It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.

I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.

Not yet.

Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?

Vulcan?

Where's the Sphere?

Contact Starfleet Command.

But how?

Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.

Understood. Keep me informed.

How serious is the damage?

There should be an access hatch nearby...

Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?

As they used to say... all systems are go.

California. San Francisco.

I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.

Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.

Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.

Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?

You're lying.

You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.

Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.

Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.

Western hemisphere... North American continent...

Fire.

Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?

Go to manual.

Fire!

Onscreen.

Worf... torpedo... now!

Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.

We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.

Right.

I'll keep that in mind.

Nothing.

Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.

Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?

What are you suggesting?

Hold that thought.

Commander... we have a problem.

Target...

There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.

Admiral Donald...Bill...

The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.

Can you - ?

I didn't mean this future.

No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.

No way.  You see this?

If they're even looking for us...

We were until your torpedoes!

Stand...?

Barely.

You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?

I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.

I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?

You feign ignorance?

You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!

I checked the data banks, yes.

Yes...

Well, I -

I am.

Aye, sir; thrusters...

Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...

What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?

ALL uniforms?

Do we report this, sir?

Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?

Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.

I like it here...

Kill him! He's the one!!

He's got it.

Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.

Candidate for what?

Aye, sir.

Right -

Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...

You hear that?

Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.

I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...

Thank you, Captain Sulu.

There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.

According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...

Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.

Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.

Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?

Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.

We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.

Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.

Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.

That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.

There was an enormous neutron energy surge.

This one can.

Yes, sir.

At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.

Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?

Yes, please continue.

You are me.

Because you are dangerous.

No.

It'll serve you right.

He was a bit proud as I recall.

I wish I could believe that, Doctor.

But the Romulans abandoned the plan.

Dying?

Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...

Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.

They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...

Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?

Divert power and compensate.

Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.

The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... Im a talking head.

With pleasure, Captain.

Do you have a moment, sir?

And I you.

Is he sincere about wanting peace?

I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!

I know how he thinks.

This isn't about me anymore.

When this is over, I owe you a drink.

This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.

What do we know about the planet?

Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.

Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.

Aye, sir.

The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.

Sir, we wont be able to bring you back. Its a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...

On screen.

I'll take care of it, sir.

Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...

There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.

Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?

Who was it?

On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.

Your new chair, sir.

I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.

A coup d'etat?

She's a predator.

I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?

Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.

Yes.

You'll acquire a taste for it.

New worlds.

I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.

In time.

Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.

Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?

Why are you here?

Disruptors are off-line, sir.

He's a very unusual android.

Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'

None.

The Scimitar will serve my needs.

I have a purpose.

Silence, Romulan!



For the moment.

I don't see anything.

Fill this out.  Will this be cash or credit card?

I'll have to run your card off now.

I understand.

No.

What the hell do you think you're doing?

Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?

We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.

We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.

It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.

Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?

We have a new directive. I'm taking over.

Washington thinks it's too late for that.

What?

You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.

Okay...

Steering wheel.

Dashboard.

Coupons.

Yes.

You're full of tricks, aren't you?

It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.

Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?

From?

Shit... shit... what shit?

You. Mouth closed.

This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.

Shit!

Yes.

Yes. Day... night.

'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'

Go?

No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...

We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.

The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.

He will.

But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.

I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.

Do they talk?!

Many, many days and nights...

In the cars, too?!

Get Fox.

Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?

Bullshit!

You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?

Was there visual contact?

Yes.

It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.

Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?

No.

Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't

We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.

You're going down.

Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.

I'm not.  Just a little poach job.

Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'

It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.

A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...

That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.

Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.

Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!

Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.

Yeah.  No, not really.

W'sup, Max?

Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.

With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.

What?

Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?

Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.

Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.

Coming with you.

Let's talk in the car.

I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.

Get it.

You'll see.

I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.

It is my sword and my shield, Macey.

But that doesn't add, does it.

So the guy's not a sicko.

Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?

S'okay.  I know you still love me.

Jesus, Mace!

It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...

It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.

Yeah, right, blow it open.

Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.

You never told me.

Yeah.  We did.

Just Lenny.

Aw, Mom!

Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.

Take the tape to the cops.

This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.

Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.

You really want that on your head?

Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.

I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.

That's right, Jan.

I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.

Winona.

We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.

I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.

This is Agent Mackelway.

That's the thing. Don't know if it connects, but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. Took polaroids after.

Hi. What's in the case?

You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 

You know, you ever think about other women?

Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.

What do you want from me?

It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.

What's with the eyelids?

At the field office.

From the grave?

He got away. I had him. He got away.

What I do requires confidentiality.

Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.

In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.

You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.

Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --

Where's my watch? It's gone.

It explains a lot.

This is some serious shit.

What's this country coming to?

My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.

Huh?

No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.

No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.

Sue Ann Hanson.

You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.

Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.

Oh.

I guess I'm a little paranoid.

And you're working with him?

It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.

I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.

Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.

Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.

But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low.

Kulok.

Yes.

I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.

I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.

Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.

You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.

You knew it was me all along?

I already have an employer.

Who told you about her?

Maybe you should back off.

You? You went by the book?

[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]

I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.

Yes, sir.

This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.

He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.

350 miles.

Murman!

I know, I know.

No. Stop, come on.

I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.

Just like that?

It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.

What what? What advantages?

What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.

No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...

Oh. You know.

I haven't heard an official "no" yet.

Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.

No...

Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...

There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...

Why not?

I understand.

I would love to see you again sometime.

That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.

If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.

...Six months.

What kind of things?

Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?

Goodbye. I lov... 

You don't call.

Right.

Right... or more likely the opposite.

You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.

What'd you get?

To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.

It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...

I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.

He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.

Go for it, man.

She wasn't your type anyway.

Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.

Make someone bleed.

Give me the money. I'll get it.

He's trying to be an actor.

...He's derivative...

Damned if I know...

She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...

Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... 

I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 

What?

Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.

Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.

Be downstairs. You're beautiful.

You think they're watching?

Yeah? Well obviously not always!

I'm just saying, not in this particular case.

Let's just leave.

Let's go.

What an asshole.

I know she's coming back.

Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.

You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.

That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?

I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.

I hope so.  We gotta go soon.

Stop.  Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven?

Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.

Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.

She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?

No, baby. You're money.

Michelle went for you, right.

That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.

It starts at eight...

Minnie Pearl.

A day.

What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.

That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.

You could make their heads bleed, though.

No.

No.

...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...

Now go over there and get those digits.

...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.

Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?

...it's on.

Be smart about it.

I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.

Then make them suffer as she suffers.  How much shall I pay you.

Good.  From me you'll get Justice.

I'll come to you when I need you.

You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.

OK, but be careful.

We gotta move...

Sure.

Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!

OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.

And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?

Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.

Barzini.

For killing a man.

You wanted me to be your son.

And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.

Come here a minute, Fredo.

The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.

The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.

If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.

OK forget it, just stay on the phone.

Mama, no.

I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.

Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.

Have you agreed on a meeting?

Who is he?

Michael, I love you.

My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.

As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.

No.

Huh?

Please say it.

OK. 

Can I go to the hospital with you?

Let HER ask.

What?

On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.

I do renounce them.

I do wish to be baptized.

The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.

Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?

Sure. Any time.

I don't get it.

Oh darling -- is that for me?

Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.

That's funny.

I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --

I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?

What?

Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.

Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.

I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...

I thought you'd missed the train.

I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.

I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?

You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.

I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.

I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?

So tell me.

Really? To Italy?

How?

I love Marge.

You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.

What evening?

Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!

I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...

Sure.

No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?

Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.

I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...

Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.

Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?

Where's Mr MacCarron?

I just don't believe that!

Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.

What's going on?

Frances?

I'm fine.

I'll go and see what's the matter.

Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.

What does that mean?

Search me. I guess we're abandoned.

We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --

Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.

And you, sir? Any better?

Shut up! Shut up!

Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.

He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?

I hope so.

Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.

I know.

I'll take them both.

Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.

They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.

Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone. 

A ragione. A ragione. 

I can't later.

Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?

What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?

Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.

You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?

I'm fine.

You try. You try talking to her.

All kinds of things. Making plans.

Peter, I... I...

You're such a liar...

Yes?

I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.

Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.

Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.

Even your fiancée...?

May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?

Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.

You have, yes.

I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.

Who mam?

Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.

He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.

The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.

I know. I could have picked you up.

If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.

You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.

I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.

Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.

He'll, what else can I do with it all?

No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.

What's wrong?

Keep it.

Just didn't get around to it, huh?

Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.

That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --

I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.

This is gotta be a game, right?

Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...

Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.

I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.

Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?

Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.

A girl needs protection.

It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.

Iris.

You can do it in my mouth.

Where is home?

Pittsburgh.

Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.

Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?

He looks like a killer.

I... I don't get along with people like that.

Do I look like a narc?

What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?

I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.

I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.

Yes I am.

I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.

You want to work uptown nights?

Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.

Physical? Criminal?

Age?

Why do you ask?

Why?

What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?

Great, hey. Thanks a lot.

Shit.

Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?

Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.

Yeah?

Yeah?

Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.

That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.

Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.

Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...

What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!

Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.

During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?

Now they only have three rockets left.

Hi.

Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.

... including me.  Right?  

I had it, a minute ago...

You look... different.

Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.

How'd they get it inside?

And why not?

You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.

Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.

Oh...

A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.

Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.

Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.

Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"

Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?

Yes.

I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."

No, sir.

I do.

Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.

The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.

Ben, when's Delly due back?

Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.

No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?

Or the Bijou.  Either one.

The Bijou?

Thanks.

We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.

Nine and-a-half years...

Ah.

Who... are they?

"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"

Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.

Yes?

Yes.

Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.

What.

I guess I did.

Thanks.

She's very pretty.

Aren't you coming?

What's his rent?

I... I don't believe this.

I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!

What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?

"Ashes To Ashes?"

It's wrong, Leo.

No thanks.

Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.

So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.

When was that?

Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it "heaven music."  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.

The customers?  I don't know...

You bet, honey.

What exactly did you hear?

Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.

You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?

Yes.  Very.

Yes.

Yes.

Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...

Yes.

It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.

When was this?

When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.

Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.

No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.

Cathy!

In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...

If your father were here...

Yes?

She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.

Shhh. Shhhhh.

It's Alice, ain't it?

Morning.

Yes?

That's where the Brenners live.

D'you want me to order one for you?

What name?

Yep?

Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.

Birds are not bad!

For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?

Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.

Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...

I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?

Yes.

I know, Mother.

I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.

I know exactly what I want, Mother.

I got them all, Mother.

I don't know.

Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.

I don't know when.  We'll see what...

We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.

If they are?

I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.

He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.

Yes.

And if you don't?

Shhhh. Shhhh.

What are we going to do about it, Al?

All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.

No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?

Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.

Monday?

About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.

I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.

As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.

How can you tell?

Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?

Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?

Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.

I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?

Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?

Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?

How does Mother know what I like to do?

I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...

Yes.

Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.

It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.

I don't give a damn what you believe!

It is for me.

What about Thursdays and Fridays?

What?

What'll it say?

So they united.

I'm frightened, Mitch.

The bay doesn't.

I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.

Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?

Yes.

Well, all right, but...

There is very definitely a difference, Miss.

Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?

What were the crows after at the school?

Maybe! Is it impossible?

With smoke.

You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.

Not if they're starting a war.

...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!

Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of...

I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.

That's right.  Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.

Ask this one favor --

Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine.  God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.

But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.

I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.

You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --

Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --

From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --

I remember her.

Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?

This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.

He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.

When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.

No.

Why, yes.

The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.

I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.

I wanted to see the white horse --

Don't call me that confounded name.

Afraid of what?

That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.

You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.

I've had some experience.

I am a doctor. I teach medicine.

I've drunk enough tonight.

I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.

Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."

You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?

Three years.

But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --

There's nothing I can say for one small child?

But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.

You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.

You can get out.

I'm looking for my friends.

You sent them. I had no choice.

I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.

I'm thinking... that explains a lot.

What do they do that they had to kill her?

Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?

Where the fuck did you come from?

You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.

What Scar? What fucking scar?

Good thing in a situation like this.

I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.

Your father gave them to both of you.

Yeah, I know.

I don't want to see!

It's not. I can't take it.

I don't know. I found him lying there.

I know.

The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.

You mean Alex.

She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!

Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her.

What did I say?

The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.

He said he'd prove it.

Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.

About you.

Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.

What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.

I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.

Yes, sir -- it certainly does!

It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.

It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.

Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.

I leave that in your hands.

Of course, dear.

Okay.

Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.

What do you mean, dear?

I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!

Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.

Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.

Where is that?

No. It's for a lot of other things, too.

Mr. Brady's a cop.

Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.

From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.

I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.

We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.

Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.

There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?

I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.

I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?

I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.

Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.

I enjoyed every minute of it.

He has his homework to keep him occupied.

Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.

We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.

Where is the meeting going to be?

Remember those words.

This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.

He'll have you -- and Tom.

He'll catch on to it in no time now.

You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.

I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.

That's right.

No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?

You better get some fresh air.

Can't stand light?

We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!

Zero.

They're gonna book us.

You don't have to beat me, Michael.  Just try to keep up.

Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.

Why?  They're only noodles.

Hey, take it easy.

Yeah.

Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.

Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.

What happens in tow and a half hours?

I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?

'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.

Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?

I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.

I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.

I thought we were poor.

We can't talk about it on the phone.

In here?

C'mere, Nanook.

But, Mom...

No, I'm not...

Mom!

I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.

Well, I...

If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.

Star.

What do you mean?

Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.

No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.

They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.

So do I!

Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.

I was here first.

Nowhere.

What would that make Mom?

Don't turn on the light.

Nanook...

Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...

The Marines.

Screw it, I'm going up anyway.

No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...

Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.

If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...

Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.

I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!

And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.

... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!

I don't know who to trust.

We'll see...

What's it going to do, being a plant?

No.  Just let him freeze out there.

Was dark... find a light...

Clark, you want me to come in after you?!

Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?

That's good enough.

But...

You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!

We ain't buying that.

Then we'll never make it.

So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.

Come on, Copper.

All in Norwegian.

I guess I'm the only one.

I think so.

Nothing we can do about that.

And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.

You reach anybody yet?

Little over two hours.

What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?

Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.

We going to make it?

Why?

I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.

Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...

The generator!

We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?

So what do you make of it?

Right.  Half of us awake at all times.

Can't hear you.

What kind of stories?

Excuse me?

Last night.

It was meant to.

This way.

Vox...

I don't understand.

They survived above.  Became what they are.

Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.

I'm a foolish man.

I know.

I just love mechanical things.

No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!

Got here as soon as I could.

Sorry... I was distracted.

What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.

Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.

And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?

I need... to talk to you.

Not here... alone.  Please.

No... let's walk through the city.

Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.

No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.

I have something for you...

Do you know you were humming?

Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."

I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.

I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?

Hiding?

I live with it every minute of every day.

When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?

Thank you...

I don't understand.

All right, all right -- here -- everything --

You're not from beyond the valley.

Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.

Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.

You can see so many here.

Thank you.

You liked it there.

Learning was important?

You know this?

Someone you loved very much.

I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.

It's undamaged?

Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?

Exactly correct, sir.

Do they?

Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.

Why?

Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.

They've gone to a better place.

Dean Fulton...

Kalen...

That's quite enough, Kalen.

They're here!  They're inside the house -- !

We never should have done this to him...

I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.

Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!

Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.

No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.

You may have known my father, William Starks.

They should just be looking harder.

What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?

Jackie.

Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?

I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.

No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.

After I...

Yes.

I know.

Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?

I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.

Ok. Ssh. Rest.

When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?

It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.

I still don't either, even after all these years.

I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.

I guess I'd ask you why.

Believe me, I know.

[Beat] I don't know.

Come on. Tell me what you do know.

I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.

Maybe.

I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.

How...how do you know?

What for?

Listen to me. That's all I ask.

Who told you this?

Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.

I wasn't talking about anything.

[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.

The Jacket.

So what am I supposed to do?

[Beat] I was dropped off.

No, I'm ok.

No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.

Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.

What.

What?

Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.

Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.

That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.

Well, son, she's doin' a damn sight better 'n you right now.

Umm, yes.  She was driving.

If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.

You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?

He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.

What for?

She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.

J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.

Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.

Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.

Not yet.

I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.

No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?

Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.

You wanna let me see your license, please?

In the back?

Am I in trouble?

What kind of stuff do I bring?

Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!

Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.

Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?

What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.

Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.

I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.

You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.

Nothing.  It got messed up.

I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!

Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?

Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!

Yeah.

You know those little dogs you see people with?

Well, now, maybe you won't have to.

Well, you got it now.

Just ignore him.

Thelma!

... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.

I believe you.

Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?

Yeah, you want it?

But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...

Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?

We can change our names.

And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...

Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.

Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.

Where?!

It's grand!

Grrrreat!

You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?

You sent that?

Woogie, I caught you red-handed.

He implied it.

Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.

Well... at least now you know.

Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.

Uh-huh.

That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.

Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.

Huh.

Who?

Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'

No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!

Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.

I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.

Tell Bill to get the fuck off!

Who the fuck is it to you?

You found my car?!

Yep.

Thanks.

It's right there on your golf bag.

I beg your pardon?

Isn't that a little politically incorrect?

-- He's in a cage?!

Here you go.  What's that smell?

Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...

Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?

You're a movie buff?

Have you seen it?

Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.

-- Love story of our time.

Wow. I thought I was the only one.

Come on, what were you going to say?

Huh... that's strange.

Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.

Forget it. It was... fun.

Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?

Uh-huh.

You don't buy what?

Huh?

Oh, uh, I resigned.

Surprised?

Your turn?

Same here.

Nice smokescreen, isn't it?

Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?

I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?

Maybe this'll jog your memory.

But... but you knew people at Harvard.

How'd you manage that one?

Nice.

I never said that.

Hey, this is a pretty nice place.

That must make it tough.

The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.

Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'

Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.

I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.

That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?

He's no Steve Young.

Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.

Puffy, get over here.

Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?

No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.

No no no, Tucker, thank you.

I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.

Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.

You mean he's not a criminal?

Thanks a lot, Ted.

A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?

Huh?

Oh. Okay. I gotcha.

Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.

Really? I never got a message.

Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?

Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.

Yeah?

Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.

Then what the fuck did you do it for?

What?! No please, sir --

Huh...?

We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.

McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.

That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?

Doesn't matter to me. If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy. All they say about him today is --

It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.

Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.

Something your father would've come up with.

-- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.

Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.

Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.

Yes it is.

-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.

Says what, Kenny?

And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.

Time is of the essence.

48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.

McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.

We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.

Still heading for Cuba.

We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.

Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.

Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.

I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.

Forget it, Scotty.

Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.

Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.

Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.

Good.

No way.

You're scared to cancel on Daly.

Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.

If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.

I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?

You're sure...

And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.

You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.

And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.

Hey. Nice tie.

Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.

Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.

Sioux Indian, right?

It ain't Geronimo.

I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.

Seven.

Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit.

You crashed my file?

Beats the hell outta me.

Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.

Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.

Let's see it.

A long way from home. You be careful out there.

-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...

Let the press through.

You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?

Why should I tell you.

She's your sister?

-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.

What'd you expect to hear?

What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.

You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.

Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?

Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.

Cuz you're a cop.

What are you talking about?

They found prints at Blue Legs' place.

I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.

Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.

Bullshit, let's get outta here,

You didn't have another vision...

If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.

-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.

You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?

I read, Cooch.

No. No, no. Thank you.

At Sioux Falls Pen?

Leavenworth a tough joint?

Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?

Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.

Well, it is. It is that, too.

Yeow!

That's all!

I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.

You know. The finger.

No.

And far too aggressive.

Apology acknowledged.

Um. You.

The what?

I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.

You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.

How about anything, anything you want to do.

I'm starting to sense that now.

You're an animal.

I don't know. I don't like being out of control.

You always get what you want?

Hardly ever.

What truth?

That's up to you.

I was, later.

I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..

Right on the flight line?

Well?

Yes sir.

You.

Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.

We're not! Trust me! We're okay.

No! Now we're inverted!

I GOT ONE COMING UP.

Roger, I've got it.

Rudder's left, stick's forward.

Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!

You go. I'm staying with it.

Any more MiGs?

Like what?

Who's your pilot?

Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.

COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.

Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?

Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?

Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.

He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.

I wouldn't call it victory.  It's more like...self immolation.

I'm gonna take him, Goose.

What now?

SHIT!!

YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.

Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.

Didn't everybody?

Me?

Yes sir!

The wings..

Yes sir.

Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!

ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

I lost.

Then why are you here?

No bother.

Or....

I don't know...

Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.

I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.

He ain't got five kids to feed.

Cheap domes.  And no air to screen out the rays.

And you get a kickback.

The Last Resort!  Quick!

Thank you.

He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.

So why am I still alive?

No, sir.

Yes, sir.

They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!

Yes, sir.

It's not my fault.  We hit a memory cap.

Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now.

Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.

Brunette.

Sleazy...and demure.

This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.

I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.

At Rekall.

How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?

Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.

Well don't.

Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!

I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.

Level 2.  Galleria.

What is it?

Split up.  Find him.

Up!

Mmmm.....

The brunette.  The one you told me about.

Do what?

Lori, move.

Lori, don't you understand?  I feel I was meant for something more than this.  I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.

No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!

Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.

I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!

It was implanted by the Agency.

The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.

Beats me.  I just work here.

I didn't know you were so kinky.

I'm here at Rekall.

Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.

Nice to meet you.

Mars.

What's in the two week package?

I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?

What's he talking about?

Blondes.

What are you talking about?

Not any more.

If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.

Jump!

I saw them.

I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?

Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?

Damn!  Val, we can't get them.  Never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop there is.  Come back.

You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...

In a minute.

Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?

Well, who put you two in charge?

Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.

Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.

You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?

Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!

Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.

You got that right.

Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!

Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!

Great.  Thank you.

First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.

Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...

Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.

Jesus.  It's slower than hell.

Like hell you are.

Don't worry about me, jerkoff.

So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.

Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.

Ran into the new college student, Rona.

Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!

Around here?  Why would they?

You okay?

It does.

Why do you all keep asking me?

They're working together, too.

You guys do all the odd jobs.

Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!

Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?

I know about Esparza.

Sustained.

-- With objection!

I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it...

I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.

-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.

I did five years in Attica. Lot of cons helped me in the joint. But I never got help from any lawyer... I built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. "Art's Supplies" is for ex- cons. Not lawyers.

Not necessarily...

I didn't take my eyes off it!

I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --

Ossining Correctional Facility. Sing Sing. Everybody's innocent there, man... Just ask 'em...

Chinatown street gang.

-- The Nazi he knifed?

We're taking the other case.

Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.

What, the lunatic who --

You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?

Christ... Shu is innocent.

-- Me? Neither.

Neither.

Eddie, I'm not working on this case. You boys have fun.

Right.

Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.

EXACTLY!

That's right.

You tell me, man.

"No," what?

When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know.

By trusting me. Shit, man...

Y-yes, sir.

Mr. Rabin has no right to --

This and that.

It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.

What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.

Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...

You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.

But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.

That's big of you, Bob.

Argumentative.

I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.

The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.

I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.

I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd.

-- What trial?

-- Roger --

Yeah, we do some of that.

I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.

No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.

A woman.

She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.

I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.

NO! GOD, NO...

Who are you? Who are you REALLY?

It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.

Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.

What was?

What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?

I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.

Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.

Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.

I am going over here.

More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.

Yes they do. Did she have visitors?

That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.

Oh.

You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.

NO, IT'S OREGON, PORTLAND, OREGON. IT'S REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF COLE. OUT IN PORTLAND OREGON. I NEED YOU OUT HERE, CHET.

COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.

The later events have never been kept a secret.

Where's Hap?

Ever see her with someone else?

What do you mean?

What do you mean?

Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.

Cole said she was 17.

Oh.

He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.

Faulty wiring.

I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.

Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.

Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.

Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?

Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?

WE got it back, that's all.

And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.

I did? I didn't see anything.

I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.

Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.

James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.

Gobble, gobble, gobble.

You know it and I know it.

Eating?

Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?

What were you doing in my room?

Sure you do, it's good for you.

Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.

Good night, sweetheart.

Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.

NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.

Look at this finger here.

Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.

Lay off the bennies, Leo.

Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...

What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.

I'm fine.

As far as we know, nothing.

No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.

How did you settle on the amount?

Yes. It would be.

Mickey told me to come back to work.

...yes. Get her on the phone...

Gruber...

It looks that way.

To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?

It's a crime.

I wouldn't do it.

No.

I... yes.

I...

I thought I would need it.

Just as you are, Sir...

I'm just an M.D.

Meth... Methodology and Technique...

Frank Galvin. We've met before.

...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.

And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.

You may step down.

...I was one of a group of...

Yes.

When she...

...that's all right.

I completely understand...

What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...

You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.

From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...

...What difference would...

No, you did fine.

The Doctors were not negligent.

...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...

Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...

Yes.

She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.

Her doctors killed her.

Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.

I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.

Yes.

My client can't walk, your Honor.

Laura.

And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?

I've got to work.

You're going to stay here...?

If I don't 'grow up...'

What is that to you...?

Stop pressuring me...

No... no...

I have to talk to you.

I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.

Kathy Price.

No. At Chelsea Childcare. Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey? I'm late for work.

Nothing happened.

Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.

A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...

...I'm sure you do...

I'm going to see you get that chance.

Dr. Gruber's not in.

...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.

What do you want?

...I'm going to need your help...

They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...

I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?

We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.

Brindisi versus Electric Boat.

So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'

All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?

The 'History'...?

Yes.

Yes, that's correct.

We, we were rather busy...

As I've said we had some more...

Huh. And why is that?

Should I?

Let's go.

All right - I've seen enough!

Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.

He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!

Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!

Would you like some coffee, General?

It's gone now.

Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!

Don't you live at home?

It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.

I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!

It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!

Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?

You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!

No.  I thought you had them.

From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?

Welcome to California!

We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?

Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.

He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.

Sort of a trial balloon.

Yes, but...

No biggie, really.

I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.

You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.

You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?

48 hours.  Back before you know it.

Chase. Hi...

What?  What kind of episode?

Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?

It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.

They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.

Everything is not fine!

He sleepwalks, you idiot!  He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.  Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...

Rex?  Who's Rex?

They were safe and could sleep.

The mean old man with the claws.

Don't let the bedbugs bite.

Rex woke me up. He was fighting.

Home, that's right.

Promise.  Cross my heart.  But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.

Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.

It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.

Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 

That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.

It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...

Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?

Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.

No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.

Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.

I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.

It can be captured, sometimes.

Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.

Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.

Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.

Choice?  What kind of choice?

Black's fine.

I haven't forgotten.

He has a lot of hurt inside him.

Give me some time to Blow the man down!

Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.

We've got weather moving in from the west.

My instinct was to not get electrocuted.

Butler, what'd I ever do to you?

That's what they get for not locking the door.

To take a piss.

Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.

Believe what?

What?

I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.

It's not a vacation, it's private school.

Shut up, Phil.

I know enough.

That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.

No, I didn't.

I can't watch this.

Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.

I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.

Do what?

Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?

Who?

Sir...?

Of what?

Your cannons made a compelling argument.

This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.

Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.

He's a big boy.

Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.

I should be eating with the crew.

I couldn't do it.

Come on, he didn't mean anything.

Shut up donut.

I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.

I figured it out.

You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?

Look, save it for somebody else will ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me.

You know what he is talking about here?

Outer.

No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.

What?

Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!

What?

Aaauuuhhh!!!

You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.

Why? He's right in the groove.

I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.

So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?

We don't have no paper bags.

How old are you?

Fuck me.

You black?

You an indian?

Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.

Ready for another?

What's that?

I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.

Have now.

What's the name of it?

Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.

Do you know Honduras, Johnny?

Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.

Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. You seen it. Plain filth.

Sailor... Lula loves you.

Yes, that's so. But there is not much to destroy.

He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.

Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.

No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.

I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?

How'll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?

You ain't actin', mama.

'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."

I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...

Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.

You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?

How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?

I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.

Didn't he say somethin'?

'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?

Yeah?

You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?

It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.

Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.

Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.

There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.

Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.

Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.

Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?

That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?

There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.

We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?

Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.

Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?

Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.

It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.

I'm goin'.

Uh huh.

I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.

Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.

I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!

Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...

I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.

I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.

You think she's gonna make it?

Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.

Okay, honey, I'll see you later.

The only one.

Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.

You talk to 'im some?...

Oughta make 'em happy.

I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?

What?

Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.

It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.

I'll bet.

You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.

Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?

You ain't takin' Pace, though.

What time's Sailor's train get in?

Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.

What if I asked you not to?

I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.

I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?

Yes.

Yes.

Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.

Santos... No... Please, Santos...

Someone's gonna see us.

No...

Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.

Whattya mean?

You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.

It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.

You heard right.

He's right, you look horrible.

You're welcome.

I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.

Your wife.

Isn't she?

I thought you were tinkering.

It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.

Shut up and drink.

He heard everything we were saying.

Just go around him.

What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?

Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.

It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.

Gee, I don't know, Crabs...  Improvise. You're good at that.

Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.

How long have you been having them?

That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?

You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!

Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.

'Fraid so.

Sounds like a good one.

It's colder in there.

Heaven?

Really?

That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...

What's he saying?

I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?

That's a big book you're writing.

Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --

Well done, James.

I guess there's probably a story behind that.

Jesus, James, you should've told someone.

Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?

Yeah, well, actually...

No.

Carvel? Where's Carvel?

Your father worked in a mannequin factory?

James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?

Kinship.

That's right. That one.

It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.

Because of my coat?

Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?

Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.

James, like it or not, they're your parents.

Just checking.

Do?

James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...  Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.

The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.

I told you, Sewickly Heights.

I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.

Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.'

I got the message you called too.

Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --

All right. This morning --

Simple.

Nothing. I think I twisted my --

You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.

No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.

It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.

A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.

Really? That was fast.

No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.

I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...

I think I might've said I was in love with you.

In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.

James is... I don't know...

Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?

That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.

Sick.

Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.

Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?

Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and --

Why did you come here, Grady?

That's weird.

You want to keep him happy.

Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.

Yeah, you still with Northland?

I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.

K through sixth.

Something wrong with that?

No way, man, you'd rob me blind!

It's a nice table.

Yeah. It's really nice.

Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers.

What's that?

Next week? The week after?

Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.

Birds.

In that birch tree is a nest.

You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.

I can't.

That was terrific.

I have friends.

Have a seat.

What?

Little Red Riding Hood.

What?

Know what?

I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.

What?

If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.

Are you sure?

Ms. Kramer.

I know because... it's just something I know.

Yes?

I don't mind.

Will I see you again?

That was a joke.

How's that?

Forget it.

I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.

I'm not that crazy.

I couldn't say.

I suppose it's however society defines it.

They usually tell me.

I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --

What?

Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.

I don't see --

In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?

All right.

This is garbage!

Yes.

Accept you?

Are you okay?

Most women wouldn't choose it.

I'm just quiet.

Neither do you.

I thought you were a dyke.

What?

Why do you want to know?

Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!

I molested little girls.

What did you do to them?

Sounds like a special guy.

No. That's what I used to tell myself.

Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?

No you don't.

Maybe you should be.

I think it's a fucking good idea.

Just think about it.

Who doesn't?

What's it look like?

Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.

Nothing.

Piece of cake, baby.

There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.

We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.

What is that?  You drop your dive light?

Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!

No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.

Yeah, okay.  Okay.

Wasn't up to me.

Your rig?

Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?

Look, I didn't come down here to fight.

No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.

Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.

You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple. Aren't you clever?  You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.

Cute, Virgil.

I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.

How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?

Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--

We've only got one suit.

What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.

No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.

What's the plan?

Tell me later.

No.

Why bring it here?

Got it. Over.

We're here now.  Let's get her done.

Yuh?

You watch yourself.

Just checking is out, huh?  How come?

We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.

Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.

That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!

Check this out.

It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.

Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.

He's hallucinating badly.

Through three miles of water?   I don't know.

What! After giving us such a run around...

Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.

You already know what they are.

I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...

Sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?

Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.

More so than the shark?

Maybe you'd better ask him.

That seems to apply to you also...

How should I be ... arrogant?

Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.

And why do you tell us this only now?

And how do you explain that?

I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.

I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening.

I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...

Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...

Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...

Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love you," I would believe you...

But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...

What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?

Why?

And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.

Aren't you going to change?

One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.

To do what?

It was futile. We went all over.

No.

Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.

Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.

But for what reason should I come there?

But why all nudes?

I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.

But why?... What if it starts to rain?

I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.

We'll try again.

I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?

And where do you find the models?

Ah, no... For me, love comes first. I'm a man, and I know what's what: first love, and then music.

Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...

Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.

I don't see why I should mind.

Good. Then I'll meet you there.

Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.

He talked to you Himself?

Through someone else?

Who?

Who told you this?

Why?

Agnes...

Oh my dear child.

Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.

Why?

They were stained.

It's not my time of month.

I don't know... I don't know...

Oh, yes!

In the middle of all the pain?

Where did the baby come from?

After God... before the waste-paper basket.

Martha Louise Livingston.

No.

She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.

I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.

She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.

An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.

Because I don't want one.

From someone who didn't want to have a baby.

Not my fault.

That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.

I'm always bad.

She can.

Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.

Alright.

Yes.

Do you really love me or are you just saying that?

As much as Mother Miriam does?

Because I'm in trouble.

But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?

It grew.

No.

I ate.

I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.

What else?

What do you think it's there for?

What do you do?

I don't know which one 

Frightened.

Yes.

How did she know about him?

Where?

Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?

Agnes, who did this to you?

Yes.

I put her to sleep.

Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?

What?

No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.

Why?

What?  You think that the girl is innocent?

What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.

If I find anything I'll call you.

Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.

She undressed alone... she bathed alone.

I haven't a clue.

None as far as I know.

Yes, but I...

Why do you think that?

What's your opinion?

That's ridiculous...

It's possible isn't it?

And you weren't shocked?

I hate ignorance and stupidity.

???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.

Then help her.

Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.

What sheets?

The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.

Oh God, if only I'd known.

I knew that after the fact.

Because I didn't know... 

I'd like yours too.

Don't deny it!

So you left the Church because you had freckles?

Long, thin and filtered.

Saint Peter?

Oh, you've come a long way baby.

Begin what?

You're saying God did it?

I'm concerned about her health.

Where is she?

Why do you insist upon pressing...

I didn't guess until it was too late.

I don't know... too late to stop it.

Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?

Eh?

We'd be thrown out.

They are?

Shurrup!

Fifteen and two thirds, actually.

Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?

How about Ding Dong?

Read 'em!

Yeah.

Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.

And hurry, they're not looking too happy.

Spoil sport!

I've made the scene.

No. I don't.

Yeah, grotesque.

No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.

Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.

Is it ... is it, really?

Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.

Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?

And you honestly think that's what she meant?

Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.

Well ... what's the matter with that?

Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.

I'm not wrong.

What?

Oh, they seem all right to me.

Eh?

Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.

But I'm clean.

It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.

Why do you always use your left hand?

And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.

We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.

Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.

Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.

Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.

Like what?

Aye, before anyone stops us.

Eh, don't take out me lines.

Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.

He started it.

Please, can I have one to surge with?

Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.

You wouldn't!

Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.

Oink! Oink!

I'm not, no.

Well ...

Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.

Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.

Aren't we ...

Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?

Sorry.

Someone put it on me.

That's too easy for Lennon.

But John hasn't got any.

Clever.  George.

Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.

You were twanging too loud.

Get knotted!

I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.

Oh, anything you say, Paul.

I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.

Kill drive engines.

Or something will be able to see us.

Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.

No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?

Yeah.  Two hours.

What's the terrain down there?

Then take her down.

Take a look.

I think that's a pretty reasonable request.

I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!

A voice transmission.

I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --

Hard to say.

Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.

Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.

The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.

Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.

Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.

Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.

How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.

Isn't there some way we can get it off him?

Can you do anything for him?

Don't be an idiot.

The only other thing I can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out.

Oh my God.

I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.

It's time for drastic remedies.

What is it -- I can't tell anything --

Hey!  what about the film?

Thanks for the thought. 

Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.

All right.  Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?

Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?

Can you see anything?

Let's let the machine work on him.

We're going into the freezers now.

We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.

Are they close?

All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?

Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.

That tube must be depositing it in him.

About four hours.

Turn on navigation lights.

Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?

Any microorganisms?

I don't even know what I'm looking for.

Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --

Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.

Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.

Let's take her into an escape orbit.

You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.

... More spores coming.

At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.

It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.

Kablooey.

The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.

Sure.

God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.

Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.

Okay, give me the numbers.

Shit.  When?

No, but I got something that might interest you.

Nooooo!

Do it.

What?

What?

Anything you say, Mammacitta.

What's wrong?

It's alright, it's cool...

Okay.

Auto-shop?

What's the problem?

Looks like it.

Well... try the headset.

I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.

Is that a fact.

Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.

Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.

What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.

Don't wait for me!

What time's sundown?

Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...

It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.

I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.

I'm not enough for a paragraph.

Yes. I do.

Yes. The Shubert.

Eddie...

Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.

And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...

All paved with diamonds and gold?

Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?

It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!

You have no right to say such things!

The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...

I never intended you to be.

A dull cliche.

No-no-no...

Yes, Addison.

Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.

It's the same thing, isn't it?

Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.

Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...

You were there? At the play - last night?

Amen.

Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.

How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.

Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.

We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?

Heaven help me, I love a psychotic.

Like a nylon lemon peel-

Huh?

Call me when you get in...

Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?

That I am...

It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...

She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.

It won't play.

You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.

That never stopped you before.

I don't think that's funny!

Everybody has a heart - except some people.  Of course I've got bicarb. There's a box in the pantry. We'll put your name on it. Max Fabian. It'll say there. Always. Just for you.

Gone.

Don't mix your metaphors.

What a body, what a voice.

I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!

Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.

Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?

I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.

A married lady.

I just asked a simple question.

You didn't have to tell me.

Is that what you want me to be?

Your make-up's a little heavy.

You're quite a girl.

What did you expect - live sables?

Oh, brother.

If I haven't, I'll find something till you're normal.

I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!

You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?

That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?

How did you get in here?

I've heard of them.

You rest. I'll get it...

You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?

Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.

My husband...

Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.

Hollywood.

Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...

Karen.

Do you think Miss Channing would approve?

Of course.

If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-

Don't bother, I can take it up myself...

- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.

Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-

But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.

How do you do, Mr. Richards.

Of course it is.

Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?

I wouldn't like.

I had no idea you knew each other.

The heave-ho.

I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...

Please don't play governess, Karen, I haven't your unyielding good taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter...  I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR should I say "ain't I"?

Three or four miles...

It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.

Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas.

We've all seemed a little tense lately...

You're Margo. Just - Margo.

Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...

About what?

I just can't believe it.

Loud.

The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!

Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-

And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-

- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...

What is?

Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking...  ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...

Now just a minute!

On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!

The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!

Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.

Margo!

Not much.

Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!

Margo, you haven't got any age.

I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...

Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...

What do you mean?

Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!

Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?

City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...

It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?

We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...

I just played it.

No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."

How about me what?

Well...

I promise.

Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?

--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--

--mine's better--

Let me lay a little theory on you--

Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.

What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.

I lived here all my life, I got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.

--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.

--a spy, you mean?

The fucking New York Times.

For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.

And I'm a Republican.

Nixon.

Nothing--I just found out that Jeb Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike freak than I am.  I never like it when the other guy's human...

Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.

--I haven't said anything--

What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?

Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.

Maybe we are...

--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.

Hmm?

Only everything...

--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--

Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--

--yeah, that was in The Times this morning.

I told you, he had to go out on a case.

I've got a lot of energy.

They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.

Chapin did contact you then?

--so?

We've just been talking to Young--

Just let me get a match.

I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.

--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.

A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 

I will not talk about the other two.

Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."

--this'll only take one second--

--it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved--

--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--

My non-denial denial.

Go on.

OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?

You're a lawyer and you're here--

Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--

That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.

--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.

...you're definitely doing a story...?

What's the whole thing about--do you know?

Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?

Did you change cabs?  It didn't work, something moved there--

Haldeman too?

--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.

--don't you miss the grand scheme too.

Security consultant.

The C.I.A.

--I'm Woodward.

Nobody ever had too much.

--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?

You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?

That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.

I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"

Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?

--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--

Absolutely.

You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--

When so ordered.

Sorry, coach.

You need some work, buddy!

Like what?

Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?

I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?

Single malt?

Whatever you hear about me, you agree.

You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.

No idea.

Why is this?

Charming.

Of course, I didn't --

Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."

You can call me Ostreicher.

Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.

How did you know I was here?

Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.

No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --

Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.

What?

Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.

Did you guys hook up or something?

Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.

Uh...

I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."

You can crash at Stifler's?

Just in time.

Come on, Jim.  Where are you?

No, but come on guys, we made a pact!

Nothing!

Okay, well that about covers it.

Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.

Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.

Well, this one time?  At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it?  But it's called spin the bottle?  And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips?  And...

Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.

"Fun loving" -- insane.

Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.

Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.

Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.

Well...uh...

Move with the music.

Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.

You think so?

Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?

Not for you.

How?

I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?

Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?

No...I know the perfect time...

Yeah, right here.

Yeah.

What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?

Does it tell me how to get laid?

What's that?

Once, in church, dude.

Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --

Dude, prom sucks.

Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!

I think we're falling in love.

Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.

Doing what?

Exactly.

Uhh! Would you die already!

Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.

Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!

Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.

Serafine...?

So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.

Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.

A cure?

Yeah. French fries...

That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!

What?

"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."

Well, they are French.

FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!

It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!

Shit!

Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...

Or else what? You'll kill me?

You'll never get the chance.

Bullshit! You're bluffing!

And you call me a moron...

Oh shit... No...

He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.

Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...

It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.

Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.

That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.

Andy? Andy is that you?

Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.

Good man. Now can I have my arms back?

Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.

I told you. These murders are not normal.

Allo?

But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.

Merde.

What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?

I was showing Sonya something . . .

Get on! Anastasia, get on!

But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!

I'm fine.

You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?

I have my reasons.

Why?

Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!

Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....

Don't be

Anya... where are we?

I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...

You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...

This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.

You'd lose your security deposit?

Bartok... a question.

She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.

"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.

Royalty do not help people with their luggage.

If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.

How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!

No. Empress, you --

I should go

Alvy Singer over here!

M'mm.

What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".

Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.

that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.

Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.

Well, why not?

Tsch.

Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?

You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-

Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?

Oooh! Here! Here!

I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.

All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!

You-you play... very well.

Okay, that's good.

Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.

I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?

Oh, yeah, yeah.

M'hm...

Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...

Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?

you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.

No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.

Oh.

M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-

Yeah?

M'hm.

Oh, yeah.

Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.

Yeah.

I have a tiny apartment.

'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.

Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.

Are yuh?

Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.

Who cares? Who cares?

M'm.

And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.

And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?

I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.

It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.

Yeah, but no presents till midnight.

What thing?

Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.

How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.

Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.

No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.

Nothing at all?

Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.

Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.

Oh, Alvy, come on.

What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."

Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?

You should be ashamed of yourself.

Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.

Why are you so hostile?

Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.

What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand...  the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.

I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.

Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?

I can't.

My head is throbbing.

He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.

I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.

Tell him.

Trigger.

Hey.

Whatta you mean?

You're crazy!

Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.

Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.

Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.

We can show her the schoolyard.

I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.

No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...

No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?

You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.

Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.

Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.

I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?

If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.

Oh, yes, yes.

Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?

Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.

I was a great beauty.

Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.

Oh yes.

You should talk to Mr. Joe.

Would it make a difference?

You're fucking desperate.

Absolutely not.

Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.

Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?

It's alright, isn't it?

Of course.

To dander.  Otis.

So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.

I love her too, Joe.

He's not going tonight.

Sally?

I love you, Joe Therrian.

Monica.

You have?

Forget it, Judy.

Let me heal you, baby.

Anytime, sport.

Probably not.

There's still time to undo this.

Through the sweats or not?

You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.

I'll say as little as possible.

Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum.

It's alright.  Be our guests.

He'll find his way back.

Hello?  Last birthday was?

What?!  You aborted our child?!

You're not ready.

I'll be with you.

Okay.

I guess.

Ah...

Sure.

Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.

Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.

Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.

You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.

But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.

Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.

No, he's absolutely right.  You're absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be banned.  Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  Can I get you a drink?

Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?

Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.

Oh.

Very well put.

Elitism?

Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.

I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.

A lot of cakes.

Come here.

Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.

Clair is a hovering mother.

Trust him.

Time!

No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.

I'm not going to leave you alone.

You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.

Sally?

How long ago was it?

Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.

I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.

Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.

Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.

She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.

I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.

What does that mean?

Why don't you go fuck yourself?

I'm worried about your Galiano.

No, really, five thousand with your discount.

Yes.  Fine.

Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.

You don't need to thank me.

Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?

I'll be right out.

And here they are!

I hope they're watercolors!

Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.

Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?

You weren't exactly horrified.

Neither does Joe.

Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!

That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!

You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?

Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --

Quiet -- sshhh!!

Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?

Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!

Well I guess that makes us even.

Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!

Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.

Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.

Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".

I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.

A <u>few</u>?

It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?

Yes...he's wonderful...

I wonder...what...was it all...for...

Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...

Engaged?  As in you're getting married?

We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...

Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.

And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.

Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.

From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?

Well, I have some paper towels --

Care to make a small wager?

Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?

I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?

Would you like to?

Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?

It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.

Why?

Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal

Let me help you.

What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.

You don't want me here --

Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.

I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.

Someone from the office.

He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.

Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.

Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?

Give what up?

Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.

Was he really upset when you told him?

Who'd care?

For me?

I guess so.

I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --

I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --

No, I don't.

Where?

You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 

For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.

Of course not.

Shut up and deal!

Gas?

Yes, sir.

I don't know.

In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.

Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.

Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --

Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?

No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?

I know how it is.

Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.

That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --

Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --

Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --

I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.

Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?

I got kicked in the head, too.

How's that again?

Thank you, sir.

No I didn't.

Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --

Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.

Maybe you're using the wrong approach.

What do you want?

Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?

Yes, Mr. Dobisch.

It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.

Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.

You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.

Oh.  'Bye, Doc.

I'm sorry if it gets noisy --

Miss Kubelik -- Fran.

Kubelik -- with two k's.

It's regulations.

Sure, Doc.

Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --

All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.

No.

Not particularly.

Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.

Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.

The party's over.

You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!

Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.

Get more coffee.

It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.

I wasn't trying.

You know I do.

I promise.

Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.

It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.

Stop that, Fran.

Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --

Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --

Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.

Baxter?

I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.

I told you -- with my mother.

Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?

Lovely. You were a big help.

I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --

It won't happen again.

See if they'll what?

Oh -- oh!

That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --

Part.

Tracks ?

Fat. That's real fat.

At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?

A long time.

Yes, sir --

Call me what, sir?

No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --

That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.

God knows.

I know.

I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --

Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.

I think this river wants to take us home fast. I'm practically goin' in reverse.

We're Americans.

When'd you do it?

Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.

He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --

I wonder if that was the same copter.

Terminate with extreme prejudice.

What is it?

We ain't goin' down the river.

They must have seen the fire.

Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.

A lame ?

Do you know that jungle?

Your daughter.

We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.

I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.

What?

It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.

Six to eight feet.

Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four -- hold -- we're right over you.

Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.

No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.

I met him.

No -- no, sir.

Yes.

Yeah, I like it...

How's the pain?

I can handle it.

No water.

What are you doing?

You get to know each other pretty well out there.

Yes I was... He said his last words to me.

That's me.

Why?

Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.

Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...

I should be checking on the boat.

Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.

Yes.

You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.

No sir, I think -- this'll be a little bit different --

Anyone got a card?

Beverly Hills --

Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?

I was gone, in September, laying traplines.  She went to our cache for some meat.  Got mauled by a bear.  Tore open her skull. -more-

The radio's on the fritz.

Be careful -- there're two of them.

You make it sound like a prison sentence.

It's exactly what you meant.

Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.

You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.

Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.

I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.

Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.

No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?

Yeah.  Maybe so.

I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.

I don't plan on dying.

Forget it.  It would take days.

You got one?

You broke the radio, remember?

Shut up!

You kill me, you sign your death warrant.  And hers.

Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.

Good idea.  Flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises.  Go too low, one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it.

Sure.

Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --

Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.

-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.

Get the fuck out of here.

Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.

So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --

I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?

Uh-huh.

He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.

Yes.

His home number.

Will you please take it?

I've got Jews at my table.

What's with the dark?

I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.

He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.

Two days.

Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.

Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.

Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.

Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.

Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.

No.

You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?

Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.

That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?

It's one idea...

I'll take a bus.

I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.

What a break...

See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.

I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.

Yes. I really would.

No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.

No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.

Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.

I just love her.  How're you doing?

Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.

You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.

Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!

He's a pain in the ass.

Okay by me.

Do it.

If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.

Hi. You have hard shells, right?

Well, I can't reach them.

You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.

What's he look like?

Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?

Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?

It smells like shit in here?

Where are all your queer party friends?

Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.

You consider your life easy.

I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.

Another place where?

Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...

What are you talking about?

I'm coming.

No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.

I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.

Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.

I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.

What is this?

What?

We both know what you were doing.

We go around once.

I know you're going to jump.

What?

What?

The contract was stolen.

A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.

Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --

Robert?  Robert?

We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'

Until a minute ago.

No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.

Because he is trying to retire me.

We don't have a choice.

It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.

Just Electra?

Where you wanted to be?

How did you get into the business?

Jesus -- why?

You were like a boy genius?

You went from high school to the Agency?

No.

You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.

Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.

Sorry.

Transmits and receives.

What?  What if he brings it with him?

Sounds pretty well figured out.

It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.

How do you know they're not?

No.

Why?

And you were drilling these holes...?

Why?

I didn't want to complicate the situation.

When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.

Yes.

Oh, God.  I see it!

God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.

I called because I just want... I need to talk.

Sometimes.

All the time.

Yes.

Why not?

It's a common question.

Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.

Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?

You mean quit?

I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?

I have all day.

I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?

Thank you.

Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?

I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.

Amazing, he didn't even say "if".

No thanks, I think we ought to get going though.

He was an electrician?

That makes you an expert I guess.

You're nuts man, Katka's right!

No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.

And suppose a little old lady lives there?

Is it gone four-thirty?

Yeah, I'll take some.

We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.

I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.

Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!

Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.

Who put a bee up your butt?

When your ready Son!

No beer?

Why don't we go together?

Forget it Doug, it's no good.

No, the boyfriend.

Holly!

It just happened.

You're kidding.

What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?

You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay.

Sure....Anything else I can do for you?

Here!

What are you talking about?

Sure I'm sure!

Doug?

Yes.

Yes.

No!

Regards to Her Majesty.

Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.

I'll take a rain-check for now.

What?

Don't worry it's okay!

I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!

We should go to the Metro it's quicker.

So, we won't be going to London?

Everybody is at home, it's no good.

But I love you!

No, it's not true, you're lying.

Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?

So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?

Well, I want them to put down a floor and a walkway.

It's not so much.

Yep, it's all yours.

Great....How long will it go for?

Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?

Good, great....Dobchay!

I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.

Thanks.

I had it coming from someone.

Uh-huh!

That's right.

A kind of freedom.

I lied to you, I didn't destroy the floppy disks.

I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.

You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?

A drill, what are you up to?

No way, he even gave me back pay.

Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!

Later.

What for?

Go to hell!

We're not sure...

The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.

That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.

I'm sorry about how we --

Kelly wouldn't do that.

Me neither.

No. I won't be long.

Yeah.

I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.

Scamming's a strong word.

Me.

Like what? The moons of Jupiter?

'They won't.'

'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'

-- I know you don't suck at acting.

Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.

Don't bother!

My relationship with God is my own.

I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.

You don't believe in anything?

Sometimes I don't even trust me.

Yeah --

That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --

You're hardly nice to anyone.

That sounds like horseshit.

What?

No.

You're sometimes not sure?

Twice a year.

What would you do up here?

No. Why? Are you seducible?

Me.

I should have told you sooner --

Anything you want.

That I want you to take me home.

That's what I mean.

Landon. I can't even do for myself.

Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?

I don't want you to see him outside school activities.

I have expectations, too.

Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.  Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.

Either. Both.

She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.

I'd do that --

Yeah.

The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?

What do you want, Biff?

I beg your pardon?

Fine.

Seventeen.

Poly-what?

How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.

Marty, you haven't been listening. Nobody's asked me to the dance...yet.

Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.

Uh, yeah, well, believe me, I sure feel like I know you!

You do?

Eileen, Chinese food again?

Well... yeah...

Bic... It's a Bic pen.

In the parking lot, with her.

George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?

No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.

Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.

Marty. Marty Lewis.

What?

Five cents, please.

What year?

Yeah,  Right.

Shhhhhhhh!

Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --

Precisely! 

Is Shemp all right?

Professor, can this thing send Shemp back in time?

So what? We'd be rich!

Marty.

Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.

We don't....

Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.

Well, it was there.

Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.

Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.

According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.

He said not to tell.

What's going on?

They come with the house.

Okay.

He never bit me.

I used to throw trash for the City.

You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.

They're okay.

Sure.

For coming onto my property... With a gun.

What's your friend's name?

Nah, I got me a job.

What?

He'll say that?

I know.

Okay.

It's your play.

What?

You said that once already... Too late now.

Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.

I'm fine. Kind of tired.

Put that down. It's dirty.

He didn't say anything to me about it.

Positive?

No.

Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.

Yeah.

Yes?

Stay as long as you like.

Just thinking.

Don't worry, I won't let her drive.

Then that's it!

The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?

Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.

There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-

Have you warned Professor Hikita?

Arachtoid.

I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.

I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.

Let her out. In my custody.

It?  Who does?

What is it, Tommy?

Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.

Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?

Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?

Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...

Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...

Who were you really trying to kill last night?

Who?

Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.

Go where?  Where're you going?

You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each other pretty well, I think.

Damn John Whorfin--!

You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.

Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.

How about you? Will you be alright?

What?! He's a son of a bitch!

He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.

If I can. He gets jealous; he-

Hah!

That doesn't help anything, Bill.

Drown all those rascals...

Oh yeah? What kind of write?

What else?

Well... actually, no Bill...

Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...

No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.

Are you all right?

I said drown 'em all! Who is that?

Ever act?

What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.

But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.

But... I thought no one cared about this picture.

Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going  don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.

Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.

Not big in the sense of large  although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.

That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies  though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,

I can feel my butt getting sore already.

Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet  what happened to your ear?

Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...

That's all right, really 

Hi, Charlie.

Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.

Well...

You gotta believe me 

They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!

Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.

Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy  like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just...

Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.

That's okay, that's okay, that's okay  that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing  although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?

Lou.

Mr. Lipnik.

Congratulations.

Yes sir, they 

I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was  well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?

Excuse me?

I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.

Nine days  Tuesday 

All of which he's now missin'.

Anyway.

Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?

Ya see how he's not writing it down?

Only fry you once.

...Fred...

She was there, wasn't she?

My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.

It's been three months.

Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.

She knows stuff about me that only you know.

My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --

What?

I quit.

I found some in my purse; would you like one?

I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.

You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?

Why not?

No.

I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.

Do you?

Please.

What if I call you Nicky?

What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?

You mean did I write it before my parents died?

I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.

I told her it was the fuck of the century.

I thought it was a pretty good beginning.

Fine.  How's your back?

No?

Why?

What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?

I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.

Did you miss me?

Come over here and tell me no.

Somebody has to die.

We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.

What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?

I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him.

He was murdered.

That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?

Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.

Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.

I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.

It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?  She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.

What are you doing here, Pop?

You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.

Why the hell not?

You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.

Catherine told me what was in it.

I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened.

You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?

Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?

She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.

Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.

Rene's been telling me about your work.

Oh, I didn't know that.

My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!

That's good. At least they're interested.

Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.

Do you still love her?

I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.

We can do better. It needed more white.

I really think you should talk to him about this.

How about right now?

I know.

I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.

How do you know?

It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.

I need a dealer.

Not black.

Who said that?

No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.

Chateau Latour '64, please.

Out?

We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist  she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.

Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.

I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do!

A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.

You don't have any fucking money..

It's Monday morning.

Staten Island would be ok.

You're your own baby.

Yeah, it's the best one.

Me? Why?

No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.

Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.

Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!

Fuck...  I forgot about that.

So what?

What time is it?

I'll make you another one.

Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business.

That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!

I didn't know.

Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?

You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.

Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."

Hanging on every word.

Things change.  Hey, good to meet you.  We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.

I'm tempted.

Yes and no...

If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.

Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.

'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.

Y'mean take off our costumes?

Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?

But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.

I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.

Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --

Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.

It does to me.

Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.

What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?

... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...

I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see, it's for winners.

I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?

Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...

Too good?

Actually, it's a lot like that.

Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -

Oh no, those things frighten me.

Too late for what, dear child?

In spirit only, I'm afraid.

Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?

No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.

That, sir, does not compute.

Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.

My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.

Alfred and Bruce are like family.

Freeze, you're mad.  This capsule will slaughter thousands.

I think not.  There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  You'll get a charge out of this.

Mr. Freeze.

No, Robin.  He's going to jail.

I know.  The feeling just vanished.

Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.

Definitely.

Can he save her?

I see you knew him.

Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.

People come first, Dr. Isley.

She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.

You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?

OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?

I find that unlikely.

You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.

Of trust. Tell me your plan.

I've got to stop him.

You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.

Well, I can respect your opinion.

Then you'd have nothing to complain about.

What did you say?

He ran away?

Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.

Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.

What?

...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.

But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?

Just checking, young sir.

And you are?

Try a fireman. Less to take off.

Did Two-Face call him Bruce?

Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!

No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!

Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.

Slanta.

Banzai.

On occasion. Usually at night.

She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?

You understand obsession better than you let on.

Would you? I'm not so sure.

The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?

You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.

Why do I feel like the other man, here?

I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.

What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?

What are you talking about?

Excuse me.

What I do isn't about revenge.

Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?

Who is it?

Yesssssss. I know!

Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.

Take me. Let the boy go.

... Murderer...

He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!

... A hundred and eight?

How do I know you won't keep them all?

Quite a while. I took the scenic route.

I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.

Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --

Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.

... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...

The does it. It's going to be this weekend.

I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.

Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.

WHAT?

Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.

What are you, scared of heights?

Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.

Because I want someone I can trust.

I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.

What?  I improved her a little...

Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.

Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?

Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?

Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.

What were you thinking?

Oh, Bruce...

Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.

... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.

Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.

Great. How??

You okay?

God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...

And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.

Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.

That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."

Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God-awful.  Why do you wear it?

Hi.....  Roses.

Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?

Meaning?

Honestly David, you're so spineless.

No, I'm fine.

Thanks, Annie.

Night.

Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.

Isn't it?

Thanks, David.  Always a pleasure.

Well, bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.

Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.

Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.

Sean Connery.

Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.

How the hell should I know?

Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....

Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.

Why thank you sir.

Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...

NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.

Nope.

Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.

Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.

Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh. TV.

And Boot-Head.

What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find that chick.

Uh... Uh...

Me first?

Huh huh. No way, dude.

Cool! Huh huh huh.

Cool, huh huh.

Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!

Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...

Huh? Huh huh.

Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say that again. Boobs. Heh heh.

Yeah. We can go see Hole and then we can get some hole. Huh huh huh huh.

Oh yeah,...I mean no. NO! I won't settle down! Not this time!...

Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?

Butt-snatch...

Uh... dill, um, face...

Yer late.

Just make sure it looks like an accident...

Yeah, we're gonna score.

Oh, that's nice.

Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?

Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.

Cut the power!

Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.

Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...

Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.

Whoa, huh huh. Cool.

Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.

Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?

This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.

It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.

We're rich in what really matters.

Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood.

I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.

I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?

They make gypsies look good.

I don't know if there's anything we can do.

You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?

She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.

Wait.

We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --

Of course I did.

Three times.  Powerful number.

... acts like she's thirty-five.

Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.

What makes you think she likes me?

3:30 I guess.

I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.

I got an A!

W... We didn't know how to make one.

Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!

Now, let's get rolling!

<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.

No.  You don't want his help.

That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.

'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.

Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.

It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.

You've <u>got</u> to say it!

How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.

At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.

Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.

I'm lonely.

Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.

No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.

They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.

I say let's keep it the way it is.

Any particular kind?

Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.

Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.

Viridian?

Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!

We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.

What happened to the people who used to live here?

That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.

Yes, but I'm going to live at home.

As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.

I understand. I've seen it done before.

But not for long...

There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.

Thank you.

No.

Yes, Robert. I will.

Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.

Thank you, Robert.

... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?

That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men.

We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!

Stay here? Is that necessary?

Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...

Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.

And what do the boys around Intelligence think?

Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.

Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.

Thank you.

Oh, yes.

Yes. I would like to be on that show.

No. I like this attic very much.

Yes. He's a very careful driver.

Your family doctor?

Hello, Eve.

I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...

Hello, Eve.

That's good. I like to watch, too.

No, Eve. I like you to be here.

Yes, Eve. I know that.

Yes. That could be true.

He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.

I like to watch.

The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.

Ben is very ill.

Yes, I agree, I think so too.

I certainly do.

Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?

We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!

Yes. You look very sick.

Yes. I am very hungry.

What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!

I understand.

I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.

I understand.

Thank you, Ben.

Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?

Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?

Yes. I would like to do that.

What sort of bed is it?

I never needed money.

No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.

It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.

No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.

Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.

Yes.

You're welcome.

Which view?

Yes. I was there with Ben.

Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.

Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?

Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.

No, I do not have any of those.

Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.

No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.

Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.

I would like to stay and work in my garden.

But you won't sign, correct?

... Hello.

... Oh, really...

That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...

Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.

Hello, Sophie.

Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.

It's not that, I just...

Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...

... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...

He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.

Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...

Right, Chief.

Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.

Thank you, Colonel.

Yeah.

Tell your friends.

The monkey.

I'm a puppeteer.

Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?

Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.

I'm scared.

Okay. Maybe tomorrow.

We'll talk about it in the car.

Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.

It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. Well smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.

Me and John.

What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.

Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.

Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.

I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."

I love you so much.

Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.

I'm sorry for everything.

I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?

This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.

Forget it.

I said "yes."

I am a trained performer.

The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.

That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.

You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.

Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!

Maxine.

Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.

You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.

Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?

I'll protect you, Dollface.

Are you torturing me on purpose?

I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.

Ha ha ha!

Hush, sweetheart.

Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.

Can I be anyone I want?

The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.

I like that.

No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.

But I think I have another plan.

Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.

Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.

Gehginnis ondah foam?

The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.

Do we get to wear a crown?

We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.

My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.

No, I didn't know that.

I love you, Lotte.

One hour.

Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.

Whatever you're having.

Lotte called me.

I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.

You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.

I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.

He's a selfish bastard.

I've got to leave Malkovich.

Derek Mantini!

Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard.

No, Stamp. I ain't.

I'm saying they came into my yard.

Was a time I knew what was.

The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.

YES.

NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.

Baby, don't be like that.

Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..

Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!

No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..

Don't pay to complain.

No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.

I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.

May I come in?

Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?

Work? Start learnin your letters again?

Extra?

I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.

NO!...She wanted me to do it.

But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.

That's Baby's kin. I don't need no invite to look after her people.

Better ask Paul D.

You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.

I don't want to know.

She was only-

Who is she? Where she come from?

Yes sir.

Why me, man?

Oh, man, don't say that..

Shit.

Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.

The?  Who the fff--

Yeah, it sucks.

Zere ARE no ROOLZ!

Come and get it.

Nothing.

I am the Walrus.

What the fuck is he talking about?

They were Nazis, Dude?

No--

Well--

You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--

Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--

That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!

Uh-huh.

I see.

Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--

--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!

And what do you do, sir?

Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.

Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.

Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!

Yeah man.

In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.

I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.

He fixes the cable?

No it's fine, really, uh--

I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.

Well--yeah, I guess--

Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?

Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.

Walter, he peed on my rug--

What the fuck are you--

You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.

What if it's during a game?

It's your roll--

What the fuck is going on there?

Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.

What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?

Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!

Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--

Whose toe was it, Walter?

But Walter--

The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.

Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?

And yet his son is a fucking dunce.

Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.

Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!

Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!

He can't walk, Walter!

Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.

Uh-huh.

Yeah.

AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!

Come on, Walter!.

No Dude.

The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.

You're a fuck, Walter!

Yeah?

Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your answer to everything!

I don't know, sir.

Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.

Bunny.

What in God's holy name are you blathering about?

Walter!

Help me put him back in his chair.

I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!

Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul.

Impressive.

We'll take 'em in the morning.

They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.

The House of Pain.

I'll heal.

From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.

Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?

If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.

I don't think so.

It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.

You put a bullet in my brain.  Wouldn't expect anything else.

These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.

Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.

It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?

For what?

I don't know about this, man --

He wants us to know he's hunting us now.

Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.

Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?

No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.

As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?

No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?

Scud.

Are we bringing home strays now?

Just do it, old man.

Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.

I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.

You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.

I'm sorry, I --

I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.

And that's a good thing?

How can you tell?

Blade --

Cancer.

What are you talking about?

I know. Take some of my blood.

You're a week early.

These are my people now. I'm one of them.

You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.

I don't believe that.

Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?

A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.

Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life.  Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle.

Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.

How?

Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.

--which she may have--

My eye, is there something in my eye?

I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!

Bullshit! Talk!

Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.

Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.

No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.

We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.

Domini. Domini Von Teer.

You feel no need to get married or anything.

I want to see the tapes.

We've looked at half of one tape.

Get your goddamn--

--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.

Whatever you want.

--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!

--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--

The, uh, blur there.

Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.

If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.

--go!

Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?

Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.

I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.

Yeah?

What're you, nuts?

Too busy eating us?

Still don't see it--

Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!

--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--

How's she going to know where to--

--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--

What?

--turn the camera off--

Fine.

<u>Now</u> you can bring the vehicle to a stop: there on the left.

Spite.

--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!

Enough to keep sane.

I think it's time to get out of here.

I thought the movie was bitchin'.

You planning on sleeping out there?

He'll never know.

Okay.

Still working on it.

What?

Domini.

--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?

Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.

I thought all witches were benign and good.

I don't....

His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.

No.

No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--

You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...

See a guy.

I don't know, he didn't say anything.

You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here?

Door's locked. Nothing there.

Abby... you all right?

I don't know. It's early... I love you.

I don't know. I better get off now.

Yeah.

With your gun?...

I don't follow baseball.

I own the place.

...Hell.

No.

Back where?

I don't know. Motel... Abby--

You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?

How long did you watch her?

Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.

It's not strictly legal.

It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.

Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.

I want you to go fishing.

It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.

Right.

What's the point?

Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.

You shouldn't have taken the money...

Tuesday.

I'm not sick.

Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?

Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.

I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.

It must be great.

Yes.

Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.

I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.

Yes sir.

Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?

. my bourbon.

If you want to.

'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.

Yeah.

I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.

Well.

Yes.

I'll go then.

See my nipples?

Then don't talk about killing.

Frank? .can you stand up?

Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?. Why are you in so much trouble?

Don?. Are you in with them?

Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?

. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.

Frank is coming?

I sure don't hate you.

Sure I do.

Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?

I did. are you?

Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?

They hurt his head.

Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?

You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?

I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.

There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.

Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.

I don't know. he moved away.

There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.

Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.

Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.

Alright. Good luck, yourself.

I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?

Pretty clever. Are you game for more?

You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?

Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?

I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.

Are you sure?

I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.

Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?

I'm really sorry.

That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?

Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?

I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?

Jeffrey?. Why?

You like mysteries that much?

Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.

Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.

Okay.

No Jeffrey!!

I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.

Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?

You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.

I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.

Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.

Yeah, I know.

My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.

Motherfucker works fast.

He what?

Five-thousand per kilo.

This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think?

Are you kidding?

Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.

Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.

Yes, I am.

Excuse me?

It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.

You're a fucking amateur!

No.

We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?

Yeah.  She told me.

No fucking way.

Not really, no.

Nothing.  Just a little project.

Good night.

Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.

We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.

Allo?

Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.

We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.

It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.

And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?

I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.

But to the victor belong the spoils.

It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.

You're a lucky man, Diego.

Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.

George, don't be so emotional.  This is business.  Besides, I can't kill you, you are my brother.

Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.

Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?

I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.

That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.

You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.

Yes, it is.

It's beautiful.

Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?

You're saying life will take care of Diego?

I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!

That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.

Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.

Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.

I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.

Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time.

Dad.

Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.

Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.

Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?

What do you guys want?

What about him?

He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him.

Hello.

I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.

She did that before.

I said, I've seen it before.

Out.

Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.

Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.

That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me.

Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.

George, he wasn't asking.

What's happening to us?

Okay, George.

Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...

Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.

I don't need a little.  I need a lot.

What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?

Yeah, but what are you doing out here?

What?

Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.

Don't be such a pussy.

Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?

It's true.

The NLF has condemned you to death.

They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.

I'll explain.

You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.

It's a question of habit ...

That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...

It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.

Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...

Good evening, sir.

Rue de Thèbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...

Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.

Of course I am.

She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.

Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...

Yes ... But let me first see you.

You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.

So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?

You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?

Thanks, Mister D.

What did he say about Miss Lawson?

A massive cardiac arrest.

We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.

Increase his heart rate.

Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.

No -- never.

Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.

Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?

Sit down, Frank.

Then she's not as smart as I thought she was.  You've seen her in the depositions.  Tell me you don't have any doubts?

Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm building a case against her, remember?

The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.

Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.

No -- never.

Yes.

We were lovers.

It didn't.

She left me.

It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control.  She always used to tell me it had to be her way.

She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.

She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.

Cocaine.

And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?

No -- she asked me about cocaine.

Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.

She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.

Yes.

I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.

One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?

I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.

He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.

What changed?

I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.

Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.

I was at the house one morning -- I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial.

He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.

So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.

Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?

He video taped you.

I thought he was a kind, gentle man?

There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?

No.

You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?

You didn't know about it before that?

Frank -- what are you doing here?

And she left shortly after that?

Yes.

Not a very good one I'm afraid.

We're not animals.

Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.

No -- it just doesn't look right.

Hi.  It's Frank.

No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.

I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.

What would?

I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.

Of course.

It's only the beginning.

What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?

I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.

She's waiting in the conference room.

The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.

Yeah.

That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.

And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?

We're supposed to go to the lake.

Yes.

We have to talk.

Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?

No.

It was a place to start.

Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.

Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?

He's not coming.

Well, there's a problem.

And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?

You never dated Kathy Reynolds!

No. What a tragedy. What happened?

Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.

Yeah.

No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.  I just have to get my shoes.

After the divorce.

Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?

Sure.

A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.

Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.

She starts sniffing me.

We got engaged.

I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.

My children. And Richard didn't like my working.

Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.

No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.

No.

I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.

The light was fading. Huh-huh.

Wonderful. Uh...

The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.

Are you hungry?

Have you ever been to that station?

You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...

I sat outside and had coffee.

Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.

Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?

Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.

You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.

You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!

For who?

Then he can move! People move!

Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?

I'm going to miss you.

Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?

Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!

They're not going to find her!

Then what do you care?

Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.

Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.

Take who where?  What you smokin'?

Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you.

I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --

Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.

Or just Hell-adjacent...

Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.

Just try it.

All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.

How did you get in here?

Who?

Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.

Or the living fall in.  Who knows.

Bill!  Bill?!

Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.

You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.

Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.

You were just a kid.

Keep your hands to yourself, willya?

That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.

I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?

It was just like in my head.

I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.

That building?

Should I?

Evidence of what?

What we have to do is call the police.

You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!

Just admit it, Caesar.

That you overreacted.  That you lost it.  Not me.  It was your mistake.

Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!

I can't.  I can't.

All part of the business.

Ummm ...  in the linen closet.

What are you talking about?

I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.

All right, Caesar.

The money?  The money's gone.

This is insane!

Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.

Caesar, this is crazy.

For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.

Caesar, what are you going to do?

Don't tell him --

Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.

Sure, Gino, sure.

I should have let him kill you.

I knew I couldn't trust you.

No.

Hey, Mickey.

Oh yeah.  Violet!

This is the police, ma'am.

Gunfire?  Is this a joke?

Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.

I don't, really.  I was referred to him.

Thanks.

Not exactly.

He said you lost something.

No.

If I say yes, will you take your hand away?

Tell me about it.

Basically.

I guess I wanted to.

So am I.

I'm not afraid of anything.

I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.

Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?

What the fuck was it?

For what?

How much money?

Is that what you think?

Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.

The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.

Don't be sorry.  Help me.

I'm here, aren't I?

Violet?

Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.

Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.

Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.

<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.

I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.

Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?

They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?

We have to go home, Jason.

It's a lot more stressful than I thought.



Yes.  Is he there?

Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?

Thanks.

Yes.

That'd be great.

Oh, Jesus... 

It's a little late for that.

Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.

I know that.

I was shot twice in the back.

...omigod, no...

No.

And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.

xxxxxx

We have to keep moving.

xxxxxx

Not really.

-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!

Hang on... 

What's that?

Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.

Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.

I won't forget this.

Uh - what? - I ...

Thank you.

I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.

What have you done to my flat?

...elephoned sir.

...ditioning.

You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -

... new washer.

... get to it.

What? You mean you've got ...

Do you mind if I use your bathroom?

Her name is Jill.

Layton.

I'm waiting for my daddy.

On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.

Your father and I were very close. Of course Jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing  and I  keep his name alive at the office every day.

Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?

Well ... well, I ...

Jack!

Even later.

Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?

I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.

I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.

B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?

He's a freelance subversive?

She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.

{baffled) I don't follow you.

Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. 

I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.

Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?

Shut up!

Jack ...

Have you got an Arrest Receipt?

If you say so.

Who are you?

I didn't like it.

It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?

What?

Where are you taking me?

A heavy Christmas present.

Well, all wars do -

What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.

You're joking.

Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!

No you're not!

Your face ... are you hurt?

Are you sure?

Where are you going?

Don't do anything silly.

It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.

I've told you before. I'd turn it down.

The refund for Tuttle!

I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!

We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!

I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed

Next of kin!

27156789/074328/K.

Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.

It's what you wanted isn't it?

Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 

There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's clinic who never come back at all.

I'm sorry but ...

A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?

This isn't rare!

Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.

Actually, I've decided ...

What? Now? It's my lunch hour.

Er, yes ...

No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.

Central Services.

Fixed?

It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right.

What is it?

What is this?  Who the hell are you?

What?

Are you saying this is illegal?

Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.

I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.

No ...

Pregnant.

Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.

That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.

Just take it easy.

I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.

She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.

I can't. I have to stay with my patient.

What did you say?

Yeah?

What?

John, play the Sinatra.

Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.

I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.

I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.

I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.

Fifteen minutes.

We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.

Because you can barely walk.

Make a left here. I want to stop.

She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.

I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.

Thanks.

What's that, Frank?

That's too many.

Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.

I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.

Crazy fucker.

How can that be? He was getting better.

He was tough. You did all you could.

You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.

Yeah. Great, isn't it?

Look out!

As long as we keep moving. No standing still.

You learn that in the army?

Frank!

I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.

You're burned out.

Relax, will you.

You really think so?

You sure?

Four times this week I've had him. Aren't there any other units out there?  Don't answer the radio. They'll give it to someone else.

Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.

Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.

Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.

It's not loaded.

The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.

Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?

I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way...

Yes.

Ravenous homosexual.

Good night.

Did you shoot their boots?

I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.

You too.

No.

It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?

People phoned in.

I'm not kidding.

No!!!!!

This is important to me.

No.  You know that I'm not.

Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.

Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.

Well -- my wife got this new job...

Your hair's a little funny.

I'm gonna go look at it again.

Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.

Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.

It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.

No.

Move away from me.

Almost immediately.

Yes.

And Bobbie says...

We could...

Should I...

No stop where he's all besieged.

Follow me.

Bad manners.

One's enough.

Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?

No.  I'm doing fine...Look.

Honey?...

It's not.

Yes, sure.

So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.

Uh-huh.

You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?

No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.

And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?

I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.

Excited.

Yeah?

I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.

Uh-huh.

Oh, good.

Because you're nuts.

Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.

Where are you?

Well, when?

Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...

That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.

I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.

Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...

It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.

You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.

Go ahead -- what?

Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?

I didn't finish talking to you!

I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.

Is the manager cooperating?

Of course...it's wonderful.

It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...

It wasn't easy.

There there...

Hm...

That means you like me!

Forget it.

Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.

I'm totally serious!

Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.

Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?

Nothing...nothing at all.

Well, it all depends, Leonard...

I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.

I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...

I was just looking at Carla's picture.

Well I was uh, just looking...

I didn't buy it I made it.

I said I did, didn't I!

Dead Cat?

Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...

What, Mr. De Santis?

I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.

Yeah and what would I say?

Excuse me I have to make a call...

I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...

I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!

Uh, hi.

Hm.

Yeah I did.

C-connection?

Smack?

Walter shut up and relax!

I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!

Uh, I don't know.

I thought you didn't respect money!

I can't.  I gotta go home.

What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -

I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.

What's the matter with you!

The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?

No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.

I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'

Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.

Amazing!

Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?

I mean it.

You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?

Down there.

What's playing there?

Hi, guys.

Uum... around ten?

Yeah?

Maybe.

I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.

You were having a nightmare.

I thought we were meeting here.

Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.

You weren't home.  Like always.

I'm out of here.  Jenny.

It could happen.

It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --

Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.

Yeah.

I'll back that up.

Yeah?

Besides, Oxnard sucks.

A dress.

For the dance.

What for?

But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.

Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.

Get away from me!

You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.

Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.

Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.

'Just remember you're in training, son'

This isn't important?  The earth is our home.

Get out of my facial.

Yeah, whoops I came.

I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.

Wait!

Lothos.

Cramps?

Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.

In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.

I had to test you.

No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.

I...

Vampires of the world, beware.

You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.

They don't even have Dolby.

Thanks.

Nicole...

She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.

I'm just a girl.

Could be.

Oh, baby!

Oh, please.

Right!

I am.

You see how nice things are when we go slow?

Big League pitchers don't use these.

My right nostril?

Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.

--but you're father's in there!

Don't worry.

Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?

I don't trust a man who don't dance.  It ain't natural.

Crash, I didn't think you--

Yep.

When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.

That's my job too.

Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.

Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.

You got me all confused.

I want to be had.

Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.

It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?

That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.

He looks wonderful, Jackson...

He'll learn.

You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.

Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.

You want me to call you a cocksucker?!

Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.

I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.

You been in the Majors?

Go for it.

I won't have to.

What?

I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.

The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--

Jesus.

You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.

Let go of me!

C ' mon!

You fuck!

I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.

I don't need a crazy woman in my life.

The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.

'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-

It's a damn easy thing to play with.

We'll pray anyway.

I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down

Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?

I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.

They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.

What?

I can't believe you're doing this.

Now, instead of the cops only lookin' at Nicky, they started looking at Green too. And he was supposed to be our squeaky...

Yes, you were.

What do you propose?

Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.

Yeah.

Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?

You fuckin' piece of shit.

Hello.

Okay.

Help, Daddy!

Matter of fact...

Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 

They payin'?

Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy.

You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.

What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?

You mean, I have your permission?

And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.

It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -

Between...

Why, somebody's complaining?

That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.

All right.

Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.

Listen...

It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...

I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?

I don't wanna come along with you.

Yeah?

What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?

I lost control?

Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.

...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!

Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.

No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.

Hey, she came to talk...

I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.

What are you -

Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.

No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...

Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.

I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.

No, I'm not okay.

Well...

I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.

Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?

I'll come by.

They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.

All right, we're clear.

L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']

No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.

She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.

Hey, Mitch.

Good luck.

We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?

I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.

You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.

It's chinchilla.

The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.

...they didn't know what really moved her.

Well, what's the difference? I just need it.

You can trust me.

Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.

Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.

We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.

...twenty-five thousand?

He wanted a watch, too.

And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.

You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.

And where'd you go?

You know why I want to do it. Just do it.

I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.

...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?

I should have -

You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.

You fuckin' whore!

I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

I wouldn't do that...

Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.

You get down here!

Oh, you are...

Let me in the house! Fucker!

Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor.  What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam

That's amazing.

These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.

I really think you're -

I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.

A record of the arrests...

Green?

Can't do it with both hands?

Can you do it with your left hand?

So, you're a righty?

And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?

Mm.

You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?

Thanks, Nick.

Hi. Good.

Hey.

Please.

Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-

...fuckin' jerk-off.

Okay.

I did - I didn't -

Nicky, I'm sorry.

Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...

Fuckers!

We're waiting on Carmine.

He's gone?

Oh.

Stay out of the way!

For what?

How are you?

Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.

Hm.

That's enough now!

Mm.

Yeah.

Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.

So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.

You're so nice. 

Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.

I did what you told me to.

'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.

Sure did.

He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.

Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.

It's what you want?

Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.

What's the matter?

Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.

No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?

You are.

I love you.

Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 

No, I'm gonna drive.

Listen...

You know why, right?

You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?

Get up.

She asleep?

But he never talked.

So are we.

Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?

Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?

They'll do it.

Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!

No more! You see? Watch!

Ch-Charlie M!

You sure?

Well, I'm a little confused here.

Yeah.

Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.

Mr. Chairman -

Receipts and bills and... everything's here.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

You are right. What can I...

Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..

It's okay. Let her go.

This looks promising...

Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.

That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.

Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?

What's the matter?  What are you saying?

I'm sure.

Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..

Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?

Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..

Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?

Even the skylight?

He didn't remember to roll up his window...

"Well done," Cactus.

I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.

A bit sadistic, don't you think, Captain...?

I know.

I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.

You're not strong. You're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you. Whatever the Cult of Good was, it's not anymore... You don't have to listen to me, just listen to you..

For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...

What's the name of your child's best friend?

Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.

What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?

Uh. "Thanks?"

Uh-huh..

What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?

It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?

Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..

You going to talk all day?

Do I hear a woman's voice?

I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.

I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie.

Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.

Theo wants to talk again.

This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?

I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!

Why would I do that?

Or relieve me of it later.

Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.

Make a "U" and go back.

What am I supposed to do?

Will you let me explain!

My name is --

I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.

Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.

They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.

Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.

Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.

I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.

I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.

The one in Brentwood.

Don't talk.  Don't talk!

If it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants.  Tufts, you know.  It still hasn't grown fully in.  The other one is from the islands.  Braided hair -- very dark.

Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.

Try what you did before.  It worked before.  I won't talk anymore.

I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?

I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.

I can't do it.

Yes.

Shit.  I'm sorry.

They put their hands all over me.

Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?

Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.

As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.

Why pick me to be your "mark?"

I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.

No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.

259-7881.

I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.

I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.

Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.

We can't leave him to repeat anything.

That's not good enough.

Pull over!  Pull over someplace.

Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.

I don't want it.

Who is this?

Didn't we play this scene before?

I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.

I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?

There are no guarantees in this life.

Stay there.

You'll still have the girl and the husband.

Don't worry.

Put the girl on.

Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.

You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.

Take the 405 south.

Are you busting my chops or what?

Them.  They won't be expecting us.

Nobody can do anything right but you!

Who are you?

Hold on.

Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.

From here on, I dish it out.

Yeah.

Thanks.

How?

Yeah?

Nice.

An excellent quality.

You heard me --

She's not that either.

What?

Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.

Guy I work with.

He's Scottish, Col.

Not me.

God no. I'm a hairdresser.

You can't leave me then, can you?

Where?

Tried to. Sit down, will you?

I am.

Is this an obsession of yours?

If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.

What is this?

Dil --

I have to talk to her, Col --

Give it over, Dil --

You mean that?

Shut up.

Know what, honey?

You can always pretend.

I miss you, Jimmy.

Why, honey --

I can't.

Afraid so.

No. Sit down.

I promise.

No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...

For me.

You mean that?

My pills...

You knew which man?

You knew my Jody?

In a manner of speaking.

Don't you want to kill me?

Stop it, Dil --

Yeah.

Anything.

I promise.

The Metro.

Don't call me that --

Thirty-five.

Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.

You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?

Do you want some food?

Horny bastard.

Can't.

Fucking do. I had him all over me.

My pleasure.

He's hot.

Leave me alone, Jude.

I know.

No, what is the thing?

What do you mean?

No way, Jude. I'm out.

So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us.

And what happens then?

And what if you don't?

You may be right.

The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.

And anyway, he's seen our faces.

Thanks.

Definitely unusual.

Just a girl.

Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.

Yeah.

So I've noticed.

They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.

Absolutely not.

Don't I know it.

You fuckers set me up. That bitch --

Why did you sign up?

And you play cricket?.

How different?

Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?

Yeah?

Like what?

What do you believe in?

Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.

How can I?

Why?

Hurling --

Thought you liked me, bitch.

You shut your face --

He's a good soldier, Jude.

Shut the fuck up, Jude.

Is there a Mrs. Canfield?

What about it?

How do you think I got here?

I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --

I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now.

I love you, Adam.

Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.

I'm through listening to you!

And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.

I heard you, I heard you.

No thanks.

We? You mean you're --?

His -- real -- ?

Danger? Why should I be in any danger?

Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 

Thanks very much.

You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?

Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!

You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!

That's not Carson Dyle.

Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.

But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?

But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?

Me? Why me?

None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.

Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?

Next, please.

The last one, please.

Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.

Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --

-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.

Yes.

Then who does?

Reggie?

Come here.

Reggie -- listen to me --

Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.

I think I love you, Alex --

Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.

Maybe.

Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?

I'm sorry.

Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?

Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.

How often do you go through this little ritual?

What do you mean?

The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.

How much is it worth?

In money.

Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?

And the last one?

Here's ten.

Tell me what?

Leave me alone -- !

But his mother --

I'm very cold.

I don't know.

And this? And this?

Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!

Oh.  Neither do I.  Voilà!

No, you see, I don't really love him.

Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.

That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.

Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?

I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.

Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.

I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?

Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.

Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.

I don't understa--

Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --

Va jouer, mon ange.

But what?

Don't you want me to stay?

The American Embassy.

I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.

Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.

He took care of Charlie for us.

Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!

I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.

As fucking if.

WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?

But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.

The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?

I want you to head right home after school.

How much further?

I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.

You never went, uh, all the way?

Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!

You are upset.

It can't be.

I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.

A bullet to the right cerebellum.

Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?

Who's?

Really?

Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?

Why?

You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.

He says he loves me.

Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.

Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .

There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.

I won't.

Everyone's getting ready for the party.

What?

I did.

Did Sharon say no?

I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.

Just making me feel like a piece of meat.

Yes?

You can ask me anything.

I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.

No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.

Why not?

You're not telling me something.

Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.

His mother's side.

Just thinking about something.

I got to go.

Ok.

Told you to hide it.

But you don't really mean it.

Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.

Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...

I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.

Thank you.

What about all that "no need to get in the man's...

That's bullshit.

This country trained me to kill...

So...where's my truck?

Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...

We do need your truck.

What the hell's a sage?

Thank you.

I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...

Almost quaint.

...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.

Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?

It must've happened right after we left.

Uh-huh.

Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?

...-to a simple thing like...

Shit!  Oh, shit. 

Everything will die, Mason.

...that the prey can bite back.

How much longer for the range and power projections?

Forty-seven.

Yeah.

Okay, I'll have a chopper meet you at the top.

...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?

...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...

You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."

You redneck idiot, do you have...

...there's a colonel...

...we're all gonna die in this...

I'll lead 'em out.

INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY. 

INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.

INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.

'Course you do, Jake.

So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do what the Chinese do?'

Row twenty-three, section C.

Probably.

Would you call him a capable man?

Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.

Maybe.

Well, It was about five days ago. You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument.

How did you find out?

Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?

I've got her.

With her mother.

That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.

Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.

The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.

Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...

Thanks, Mr. Gittes.

Where's that?

Jake, listen.

I said okay, Jake.

I've been wanting to meet you.

Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?

Didn't you call?

I don't.

Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.

How did she...  ...happen to have them?

What pictures?

Matter of fact I do.

Gee, thanks, Lou.

Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.

Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.

He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.

Yes.

Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.

Yeah. Fine, thank you.

Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.

Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.

I said I'll drop it.

I don't want to drop it.

Looks like you went quite a distance.

I have?

Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.

How did you find out?

Why?

Did he know?

You were seeing someone, too.

Another satisfied client's wife.

Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?

Yes. He never forgave him for it.

Of course I'm sure.

What dam?

The Valley?

No.

What? What is it?

Doing what?

The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?

Yeah.

I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.

There's something black in the green part of your eye.

Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.

He owns it. You know?

Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.

Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?

Where's the girl?

What did you do that for?

No...

What are you saying?

...no...

Yes, Mr. Gittes.

What'd you expect? That's his job.

I think I got something.

It's on your desk. Say, you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins?

Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?

No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...

We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.

J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.

Maybe he takes it very seriously.

Hope so. He's working for us.

I cut myself shaving.

I never was.

Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.

Yes...

Yes?

Well... I think I... I would've remembered.

Well, no.

When it comes? What'd you tell him?

So how are you, Morty?

It's not completely dry.

Mr. Gittes...

I'm afraid so.

I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.

But...

Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.

Yeah, I'll do that.

He was expecting you?

They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.

I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing  apple core.

All she needed for that was the phone book!

I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.

No, you have a press agent do it.

I'm working for his daughter.

Well, you never know, do you?

We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?

...and turn into a piece of charcoal!!

I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 

Fifty lire... 

Why? What do you mean?

Yes. 

They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?

Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 

Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 

I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...

Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.

We'll talk about that later.

Who?

And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...

So what's that got to do with it?

How are you, Mr. Thatcher?

Thais.

Please, Mr. Bernstein.

You know why?  She was so -

Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -

Certainly not.

I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -

Yes, Mr. Bernstein.

Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.

I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.

The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.

There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -

Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -

He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -

I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right.  He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.

Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?

I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?

Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected.  To start with, I'll break your neck.

In the water.

But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?

Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.

Half past eleven.

You're my wife, Susan, and -

We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -

As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.

Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!

Susan!

Susan, it seems to me -

I'm not sorry.

You can't stop me.

Thanks.

Can you prove it isn't?

Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.

Can't say, sir.

He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?

It's a good idea for a newspaper.  Four hundred sixy thousand.

- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.

I'll get you some coffee.

No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.

She's going to leave you -

I know you will.

What do you mean by that?

Sure.

We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.

This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -

Queer?

Sentimental fellow, aren't you?

Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.

If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...

What about that apartment?

Rosebud?

It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.

It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.

It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.

This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?

Okay. I'm sorry about that.

You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!

Can I join in?

Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?

Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?

Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.

I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.

So you're really getting married?

Tell me I don't have something to do with it.

I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.

So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?

I left like an hour ago.

Was it you?

Call the police.

Nobody. It was closed.

"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.

I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.

This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.

What's your point?

So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?

Yeah.

Oooh! Navy Seals!

Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.

Why are the shutters closed?

Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.

Go open the sore.

You called Caitlin again?

I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.

I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?

Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?

Oh, my God.

Your mother.

Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.

Blasphemy.

There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.

All right, Vader's boss...

Basically.

How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?

You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.

Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!

FUCK!

I don't back down.

I'm going to miss the game.

Can we not talk about this?

Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?

I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.

She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.

Bible truth.

No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.

Balls resting on his lips.

Reach what?

What, your dick?

I never tried it.

I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!

So the casket fell over! Big deal!

Because I'm happy.

I'm happy.

She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.

Watch the store while I go home and change.

No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.

Shut the fuck up!

I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.

I was born.

What responsibility?

Oh, like your life's any better?

Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.

The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?

What time did you get to work today?

Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.

Thirty-fire.

I know I can bench more than that!

Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.

What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.

How do you know that?

While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.

A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.

I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.

Actually, that's his night job.

If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.

Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?

Jesus... go ahead.

Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?

No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.

I'm not even supposed to be here today!

Something wrong?

It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.

Including you; yes.

After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.

Why do you say that?

Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.

Please calm down.

Dante...

Let it go...

...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!

Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.

I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.

Sure.

I don't want to go back with her...

No way.

Swear.  Olaf, metal!

You gotta hear him sing.  Olaf, "Berserker!"

No way!

That's tight. Solid.

She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm.

Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.

I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?

Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.

Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?

Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!

Which one?

Says who?

Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.

I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.

How yo doin', Gabe!

Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!

C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!

They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe.

I don't know.

Hal will have my head for this.

I admit, I can be bought.

If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.

Where's the radio?

I did what I thought was right.

There wasn't time for anything else.

Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.

Give him the money.

Help me!  I don't want to die!

Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?

Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...

Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.

A lot of things fell apart up there.

I don't think you do.

--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...

He doesn't want my help.

Can't do it.

You got to go back now!

I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.

If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.

No, not really.  Throw down a rope.

Get it!

Never

That's exactly what I want you to do.

There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?

The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.

When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.

Tucker and Walker.

Half a day.

Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.

Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.

Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!

I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.

You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?

We've been working hard too. Takes glass.

For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.

A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.

Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.

The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.

Thank you, sir.

... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.

Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?

I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.

Alex.

A cup of the old chai, sir?

That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.

Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.

Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.

I did, sir.

Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?

We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.

Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?

Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.

Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?

... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.

You wanna be sick?

No, sir.

No, sir.

Right. The mothballs, Mister.

Crabs?

Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?

How're you feeling this morning?

Vitamins will it be then?

What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?

Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.

But it was horrible.

Yes!!!

Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?

Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?

Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.

Yes.

It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.

I'm sure it won't be long now.

Yes!!!

But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.

Oh - and what's so stinking about it?

I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!

They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.

Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?

Amen. They cross themselves.

Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?

Leave to carry on, sir, please?

We've only just read about it in the morning papers.

Four in this block, sir.

Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.

Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.

Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.

Travel...and things.

How often you go?

Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...

I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.

Oh, my, yes.

Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.

'Fraid so.

Can't say that I do.

I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.

Wouldn't dream of it.

Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that...

So?

Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?

This isn't our goddamn game!

No harm done, ma'am.

Oh, call me Ida.  To what do we owe the pleasure?

And you came all the way down here to see me?

I give a shit whose fault it was, you're payin'!

Me, specifically?

I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?

The trunk?

His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!

I'm trying...

What?

I told you we had other stops to make tonight.

Yes.

Believe it.

Why?

I need the job.

What?

I never learned jazz.

I'm not catching a melody.

Leave me alone.

Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?

Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?

She's in the hospital.

There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother!

Oh, I'm captivated.

You'd do her a favor.

Jazz.

You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off.  Quit stalling and get out of the cab.

Makes two of us.

I only owe you a ride, Vincent.

That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...

You're full of shit.

That's what you said...

None of your business.

Who?

Excuse me?

Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.

Geronimo?

Why the hell not?

Shut the hell up.

Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.

You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.

Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?

You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.

Switch the charts.

What is?

Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?

Arf... You gotta help me.

Don't tell me you're naked back there.

You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?

Nothing is easy.

Yeah.  I think so.

Believe you about what?

'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?

Never heard of him.

I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?

Uh huh.

Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.

It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.

How is it possible?

You watch me, don't you?

What van?

Realized what?

Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?

What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.

A water main broke.

Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.

Now's not really the time to get into this --

I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.

I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?

Thanks.

Did you kill him?

No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.

I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.

It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.

You saw me standing alone ...

I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.

I can't promise you anything.

Now she tells me.

Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.

I'm not sure what you mean.

You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.

I'm sorry.  What was the question again?

Excuse me?

If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?

I don't understand.

Not today...

Your call.  Have a good night.

What do you mean?

Nothing.  I was just making sure. So, who are you?

Ellie?

What?

Yes, sir.

I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.

Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.

-- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.

Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?

Oh?  How's he doing?

I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --

If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?

I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.

Are you threatening me?

Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?

Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.

Good luck, David.

What would you have me say, David?

Thank you?

Analyzing signal polarization shifts.

In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.

No primer.

Put it on speakers.

This is how you see the sky?

It's beautiful.

Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...

It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.

It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.

Is that your official response?

Big enough radio, I don't see why not.

That's a beauty, Captain.  Now get some sleep.

That's my scientist.

Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.

Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...

The librarian... or the library...?

You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.

Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.

I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.

That's my girl.  Done.

Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.

Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.

Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.

The systems integration site.

I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.

That's what they all say.

Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.

'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'

I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.

Jesus --

Ellie --

Like it or not.

I'm -- I'm fine.

That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --

What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?

Can you try?

I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.

Maybe you're creating a monster.

Why?

In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.

Something like that.

I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.

It's late.  We should go back.

An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?

I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry -- I can't --

I can't do this --

Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --

It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.

Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!

Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!

Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.

Recommendations?

Git movin', I said.

We work down in the ditch?

Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?

Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.

Here, Mom.

Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.

Ram it in and break it off!

Yeah. Come on out, Luke.

Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.

I... I... I...

She's got him! You hear that?

Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?

You jes' watch us!

Borrowin'.

Look, she's got paint on her toenails! Oh Lord, whatever I done, don't strike me blind for 'nother couple minutes. Oh you Lucille!

I call.

What happened? How far did you get?

What for?

A Lucas Jackson.

Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...

But damn if he don't look like a fat old Dragline.

That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.

Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.

Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.

Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?

Come on, boy, come on, darlin'. You kin do her. Just let that ol' belly sag and enjoy itself. Stay loose, buddy. Eight more, between you and everlasting glory. Little ol' eggs, pigeon eggs, that's all, fish eggs practically.

Your Luke's got more guts than brains.

Gettin' up, Carr.

Cuter.

I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.

That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.

How about you tryin' to make me?

No. No chains either.

Only kidding!

Fear of what...

A little homeopathic cure for the willies.

Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?

Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.

When was the last time you washed your hair?

Andy?

I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.

Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.

I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...

The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...

I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...

Something personal.  Is he bothering you?

You come and visit.

Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?

Where are you, Peter?

It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?

I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...

You know where.

That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...

Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here.

You're calling me a crank?

You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?

Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.

Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?

I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...

Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...

That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.

Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.

Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.

You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!

One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...

He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.

He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.

I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?

I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.

He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.

If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?

Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.

Let me get a little action started here.

I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...

No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.

Is there a phone booth there?

Go and look for a note.

What else?

He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...

He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...

Because it's your job, that's all.

Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...

Who gives a fuck?  In all the years I never seen you cry.  You loved him.

He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?

Let's get out of here...

Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...

Look at her legs.

Look at him, grandstanding...

It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...

Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too young.

Right.

Yessir.

You're damn right I do.

I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.

I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...

So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.

No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...

...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?

What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?

Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?

I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen.

Thank you.

You should have gone to the funeral.

You're not envious?

Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.

James.

It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...

Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.

We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.

That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.

I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.

Yes.  They felt like traffic accidents.

No.

Are you still involving me in your crash?

A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.

It's something we're all intimately involved in: The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.

You could get your wish at any moment.

Where are you?

What?

Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.

Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes. 

OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.

Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.

I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.

You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.

Please, Letty.

And the party?

I'd have to see it on.

Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.

Oh, no, of course not.

Paul could pop the question at any time.

Especially with a promotion in the offing.

Can I get you a glass of champagne?

Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.

We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.

Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.

Not even if it's something positive?

I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?

Don't be fresh.

Lie?

I guess so. I think that's right.

I answered these questions last night.

Who do you think you are?

Anything interesting.

I've already checked it out 17 times.

Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.

Very romantic setting.

I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.

No rounds for another three hours.

What are the delusions like?

Do you?

Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?

So, it's over?

Aren't you ever quiet?

Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.

I like it.     But Headlines are better.

You, too. Kick ass today.

The restaurant, too?

You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.

And all the plans we have.

Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.

I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

What do you want to do?

That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.

The receptionist said you called earlier about something.

Oh, ok.   Maybe.

Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?

I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.

No, it's not like that.

That's a big question.

Especially this last year.

So, I've been thinking a lot...

It's, it's really nice, Paul.

So, what do you say, Let?

No, no.

No.

So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.

I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...

When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.

Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?

Where did they go?

It's me...

You're calling me on your cell phone, right?

Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?

C'mon, Laurant, America?

What?

Good.   I'm good.

When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.

He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.

I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.

Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?

I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.

You want me to help you get out of the country?

Half the tapes.

I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.

She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --

No one? Then why is Zero here?

You want Zero to kill him?

And the Vodka.

I'm trying.    It doesn't work.

I can't believe you didn't check.

I think he's already figured that out.

I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.

Do I?

Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.

You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.

I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.

I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?

We had a deal.

There's just one more thing I need you to do.

Good song though.

Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.

No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?

A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.

I was told to take what we have and go.

Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?

What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?

Okay.    I will have a beer.

C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.

Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.

What the hell is he talking about?

I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.

Okay.   You can be Elvis.

The baseball is mine.

They sort of got away.

How?

It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.

Oh, you think?

Tonight.

Take a nap.

Something like that.

You ask a lot of questions.

It's okay.   It was a long time ago.

I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.

After last night I could say the same for you.

-- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine.  Break his arm.

Why were you spying on the Yus?

She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.

Really?

You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.

His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.

Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.

I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.

How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!

Not another lecture!  On guard!

It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.

Give me back my comb.

You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."

No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.

Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?

You always suspected she'd fled to the West.

But your men are watching over Yu's compund?

My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.

A female criminal!  Now that's news!

I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...

What does it say?

Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.

When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!

Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.

Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.

Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.

I'm buying.

No further.  I'm serious.

You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.

I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?

Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?

I dabble.  May I?

Who?

A remembrance.  A closure.

And she'll be alive.  Up here.

Take the dope, too.

You don't even remember...

Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.

Is he inside?

I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.

"Our" Crow...?

The night is young.

I don't think so.

I'll be fine.

You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.

Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.

Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.

On my mother's life.

I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.

It's not really important.

Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.

What'cha reading?

Great book.

Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.

Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.

You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?

I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.

Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.

Yes.

Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.

How was your date?

"I actually feel good about myself?"

I am lighten. Can we drop this?

No.

Who's Monsieur Philipe?

You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you.

That's not fair.

I think that's for the best.

It was perfect.

Yeah, me neither.

What are you saying?

Any ideas who it could be?

Greg McConnell.

Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.

Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.

Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.

Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.

I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.

He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.

Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?

Eww. No. That's gross.

Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.

No.

It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.

Well did you like it?

I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.

You think he'll like it?

Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.

No.

Good night Cecile.

Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.

It works a little.

Really? Care to make a wager on that?

What, nervous I'm going to win?

Baby?  Right on time.

Pretty sure or sure sure?

I'll be in touch.

No.

I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.

And this happened before you and I hooked up?

He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.

Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.

If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.

Be more specific.

What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.

Even there?

Okay.

Shhh.

You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.

What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.

Take a look for yourself.

Morning.

Where is she?

Mock, mock, mock.

I have a flair for drama.

You wanted an answer to your question.

Thank you. Now, where were we?

Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.

I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.

Get out!

How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?

It's Cecile.

Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...

I know how it is.  My Dad collects miniature canon.

I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.

It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.

I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself  tell the truth --

I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.

The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.

On the back street  a green house

Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?

It's early yet.

I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.

Well, you know where it is.

Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.

She said something about that, Mrs. Reed  but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.

Yes, I did.

Yes, daddy.

It was on account of the birthday party.

I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---

It's true.

Daddy, it's true.

You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.

This one says, "To Mother from Amy."

But...

I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.

For as long as you'll let me.

Whenever you want.

I'll just never learn arithmetic.

That one's an elm.

It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.

I'm trying to.

But she's such a nice lady.

But what happened to the little deer?

Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days  those beautiful, shilling, golden days.

Anybody could know that song.

Yes, Barbara... Barbara...

That's from her -- that woman.

Wait a minute. Listen.

Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed.  I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.

Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.

Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.

I've changed a lot lately.

I've been working out.

No, it was another woman.

What else is there?

It's not just in my head.

Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.

Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.

Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.

What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?

I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away...

Rule one: always wear make-up.

I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.

I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.

No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.

No.

Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.

You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.

You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.

Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.

Frida? You okay?

So you're Grant's secretary?

Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.

I'm not really hungry after all.

Well, whattdaya think?

They say sex is great for cramps.

I didn't have to pee then.

Oh my god, I'm sorry!

You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!

Yes, that's what we're looking for.

Very well then. Is that all?

Are you following me?

That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.

I can forgive you a bestseller.

Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.

NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.

A man killed in Central Park.

He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.

I love you too.

You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?

Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?

Worse than this?

Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.

No, take it.

Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.

Take some allergy medicine.

We're just trying to figure out what happened.

I told you she was innocent.

And you think I'm sick?

We only live a few blocks apart.

She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.

Looks like you need a haircut to me.

Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?

He tried to kill me!

Just visiting my patient.

You are mistaken.

<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!

Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.

Who?

Don't know much, do you?

No...  No doctor...

There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?

Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?

Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.

Yes.

You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.

I'm nothing then.

No it isn't.  <u>You</u> are doing it!  Now raise it over the glass and...

That's easy.  You...

Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?

A month.

What the hell is this ?

No...

) Listen, you little...

Yeah.

I can't believe he'd do this.

She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.

Yes.

I was a senator, you know.

What about her.

Fine.

Clean.

Oh.  Excuse me.

And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.

I was gonna do something with Joan.

This is undeclared income.

I'm not sure.

It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.

Oh yeah... 1'm fine...

Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...

Oh my gosh...

Oh, yeah... probably...

I'm afraid so.

Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.

Absolutely.  Well, that might be kind of tough. Once the press starts smelling blood...

What?

Certainly.

First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'

No thanks.  It's not that far.

Mind if I sit down?

They asked me to help.

Home.

Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.

You1re leaving, too?

I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.

Just wait.

You have a lot of secrets.

It was inspirational.

I know.

... Me, too.

... Not exactly the Oval Office.

We're working on it.

Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.

There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.

To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...

I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.

Come on.

I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.

SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!

SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP!

I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...

gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.

We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.

Gasparilla?

Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?

I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.

Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.

You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.

It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.

He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?

We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.

The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.

We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...

Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!

You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!

Hey. Slow down. What is it?

That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.

We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.

For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.

I'm alright. Let's go.

Don't come.

Terrible.  Awful!  I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life!

Women swoon!

What is the point?

How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.

I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.

I'm sorry.  I, we

I think you're sweet.

But...

Good.  We're very excited about him.  He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know.

Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar

Sure.

I'm in.

Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.  All your asses are safe.  Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?

No.

Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.

It does?  What?

Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.

Knox, why are you doing this to me?

Then come with me.

Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?

Meeks.

Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."

I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.

A barbaric yawp.

A crazy madman.

I have something.

Yeah.  He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business.  But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  As long as I keep my grades up.

You have another choice.

Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.

I don't know.

Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak.

She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.

But she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend.  What would the dead poets say about that?

Nothing.  No mention of it.

I'm sorry, Neil.

Father, I wasn't disputing you.

Yes sir.

Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-

But different.

Todd Anderson.

Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.

Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.

Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!

First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.

What is that supposed to mean?

Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.

Quiet.  I have to think.

It's my birthday.

This play?

Do you have to quit the play?

Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!

I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...

Which question is that?

I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.

I told you...

Did you clear this?

You hear that?

Well, you sure do a good imitation.

Quite a few.

With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?

You quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living...

Keep tasting...

He's not coming...

...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.

I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...

You don't give a shit about anything do you?

Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...

Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?

And you got 10 minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening.

Line it up now, nice and easy...

How does an island sound to you?

A passenger...

You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?

Nothing.

Hey! You hear me? Come out!

There ain't no thing here!! No thing!! There's you him and me!! Got it! You him and...

Yeah.

I know...

Good... Pass the beer.

Hey Geraldine, let's eat!

John,we're going huntin'.

Yeah, Sal--

It is too! Now you passed it!

Fuckin' A. It's gotta!

It's Nick!

Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.

Couple of weeks... Listen --

Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???

You talk to him?

Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.

But you must come in.

Thanks.

Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!

Rough.  We didn't have to do it, John.

Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?

Sal's alive???

Here.

Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.

Biederman!

Linda... Hey, Linda...

Would you?

No.

Fine. I'm fine. How are you?

That was nothing. That wasn't anything.

Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.

Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.

I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!

That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air.

I don't know.

Playing.

Who the hell knows!

I want to go home, Merle.

Merle, I wanna go home!

Right here.

I know.

Yeah.

Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?

It's ahead, Vince.

What are you, God?

You're right... Okay, you're right.

When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.

Nick!... I thought you went home.

You wanna bet?

What do you mean, no???

Nick. Hey. How's things?

Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.

Yeah.

I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?

No.

Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.

Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!

I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.

Down.

What'cha got, Bennett?

Technothugs?

Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.

Your mother.

I'm not voting for you.

Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?

But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.

Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.

Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.

Not the 'T' word.

Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.

There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.

Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.

I'm not fond of television comedies.

Yes.

Bacon cheeseburgers.

Trust me.  You don't want to know.

You can't catch this man with a computer.

Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.

This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago.  Thought maybe he'd come back.

I'll be okay.

I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.

No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.

No, sir.

I'm here.

He's got my grandson, Sanchez.

I'm signing off.

He went dirty and they made an example of him.

My mom says I'm gonna grow.

My granddad was a policeman.

Hi.

This little thing says I can't.

We will --

Of course I will.

I didn't.

Guess there will, if it says so.

Young man -- you got me there.

Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.

You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.

No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.

No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.

Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.

Howdy, Hank.

Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?

Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?

But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.

No, Stone!

I'd like to know where you'd get it....

No, you're not.

Opportunities?

Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--

That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.

I don't care.

Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!

Never!

Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.

Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.

That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?

Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.

Shall we?

Morning, Jabez.

Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?

You want me to go around --

That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.

Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.

Jabez ...

Looks right elegant, Mary.

Tired?

There is nothing to worry about now.

But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --

I am going to lock him up.

Oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone!

I don't know, Jabez.

Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --

I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!

It don't matter!

It's all right, Sheriff.

Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.

Mary -- Jabez --

Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.

Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?

You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.

Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.

Are you, Mary?  Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way.  Party seems to be quite a success.  Lots of guests, anyhow.

Hullooo!

Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.

My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.

Married.

It's okay, it's okay.

Mind if I play some tunes?

Just remember that when you sign for the tip.  They're paying for it, so don't be shy.

Tell me about it.

What does he want?

See to Heinrich...  Now...you can break the code key...?

He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.

I'm a cop from New York.

Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.

Then don't waste time talking to me.

We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.

Oh...Where does he live?

Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.

Don't I always?

Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks.

I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.

Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?

Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.

In my youth, partner.  In my youth.

I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.

Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!

I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.

They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.

Don't let 'em off the ground.

Yeah.

It's okay... it's okay...

That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.

Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...

Yeah.  It was terrible.

You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?

What trip?

Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!

Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.

He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!

What?

Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!

You don't have a choice?

He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.

What are you doin' in there?

Right -- I'm with you, buddy.

Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.

Oh, no ... Women is all we got.

Calm down... look at this, look at him...!

It's okay, you got a lot of protection.

I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out.  I got superiors, unnerstan?  They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.

What do you want?

Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.

There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?

Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!

What makes you think you'll be able to control it?

I can take care of that.

Come on, lemme load you up...

Gimme the keys to get outta here!

If you take anybody, please take me.

I don't fool around with you.

I don't know, Sonny ... on the roof somewhere I guess.

Special to me, too.

We like you, too.

Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.

My body?  What for?

You're serious!

What?

Dead or alive?



Wyoming.

He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.

He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?

I'm here.

Okay, when do I get them?

Okay.  Which one goes?

What's the matter... they never housebroke you?

I forgot she's in here.

He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.

Yeah - it looks real official.

I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.

Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...

I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?

What'll you do?  Come out.

Maybe...

Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?

<i>Are you all right?</i>

You know what I'm talking about, did you fuck her?

Did it hurt?

What?

I fucked up. You can't help your greedy black lying ass from trying to get everything. All you've done is put a death sentence on Meeka.

And?

Two dollars!  Forget it!

What?

Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?

Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.

OK.  OK.

Later.  Gotta get paid.

Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.

What responsibilities?

I'm getting paid...

How are you holding up in this weather?

Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!

What?

Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.

Run it then.

Be off in a second.  Tina, I dedicated a record on Mister Señor Love Daddy's show to you.

Big deal?  If that's not LOVE, I don't know what is.

You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.

You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.

Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.

Quit bullshitting.

You keep it.

When?

What took you so long?  Is it hot?

Then we'll do something else.

Trust me.

Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.

It's 'pose to be cold.

Meda.  Meda.

Tina, I'll be right back.

Later.

Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?

Well, fuck you, too, and fuck Michael Jordan.

Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.

I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.

Tell Vito.

Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.

Too many pizzerias already there.

We don't know nuthin' else.

'Bout time, Pop.

Tell 'em, Pop.

Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.

Yeah, I think.

I'll tell you why!

Yeah. How'd you know?

Heddo Jeth-ica.

Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.

We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.

Yeah...

Ooh gross.

Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?

Very good. Back in a jiff.

Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."

Famous? I've never heard of it.

Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!

Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!

Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.

Probably because we've never met.

Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!

Is that what I think it is?

Cool.

You're it.

JESSICA? Please hold for my reaction.

A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!

Shut up Lloyd. You're not married yet.

Don't look directly at him.

And he invented fire.

HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.

Ow... What do you want to do, HARRY?

Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.

I don't know. I haven't decided yet.

Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.

You have beautiful eyes.

Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?

Do you hear something, Captain Rob?

You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.

A blimp.

Who?

Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.

Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.

Do you know what this means?

We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.

That's it. Build him a float for the Thanksgiving Day parade!

Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started.

PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.

Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!

He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.

Right.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Not to expect you tonight.

I'll talk to you later.

You know, "some". The fag stuff.

Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.

Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.

So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?

Me too. I'm almost there.

Looks like the best man won.

Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.

Go in there and get us two slushees.

Do we have a deal?

Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.

He passed away three years ago.

Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!

We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!

People! Come on. "Parade" float.

No, it actually fit quite nicely.  Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.

Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.

Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.

Wow, you are smart.

No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.

Everything. Just for the record.

Just like the President.

The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.

No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.

Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.

Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.

Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.

I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."

Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.

My Lord?

I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.

It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.

You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...

No.

Always.

Long live the fighters!

NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!

Not all of them... I know which ones will.

Where?

Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.

It's a pleasure...

No.

I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.

The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...

The <u>women</u>?

Hey Bela, how do you do that?

Do you want me to get it for you?

I don't understand.

Ah, so I pull the strings!

Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?

Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...

No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...

"Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."

Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!

I never said I could ad-lib...

I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."

This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.

Really?

Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.

Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.

I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.

Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?

Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.

Soon, Bela... Soon.

That's great.  Let's do a take.

I don't know.  Where?

You mean a Tesla coil?

Rolling.

Don't you want a second take, for protection?

Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.

And who may you be?

Yeah.  It seems a little crazy, but sometimes <u>you just know</u>.  She's perfect for me.

We'll do our best.

Isn't he?

Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.

Ed, it was only one review.

Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.

Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.

Like <u>what</u>?!

Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.

I understand you just moved here?

You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.

But Bela Lugosi's in it!

Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.

Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.

Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??

It's a guaranteed blockbuster!

Yes?

Oh, of course!

Mm, not good-lookink enough.

Really?  Was the third act too intense?

Okey-dokey.

Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.

It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...

Who?

I don't think he's a schmuck.

Why not??

Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.

Oh.  Congratulations.

Oh.  My condolences.

Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.

What do you mean?

Okay?

Uh, atomic energy?

No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?

You don't wanna be noticed?

I don't know.

Yeah...?

Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  But this'll be great, I promise!

YES!  JUST DO IT!

Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."

Mr. Wood!

I'm directing.

And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!

You know, you're a very attractive girl.

Don't worry, I'll teach you.

Isn't that the same thing?

Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.

Yes!

What?

Ooh, the sister! She is hot.

Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?

No, uh...

What if Shari's the dream?

Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --

Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!

Thank you. Can I see her?

What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...

So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.

When? Today?

Yeah?

Yeah. The camera guy is here.

Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.

No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?

Oh my God!

Oh my God!!

Yes to me or yes to the coil?

But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?

So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.

I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.

Why? How...

But Al is your husband now!

What are you talking about?

Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.

You batted or you bunted?

Well, then I'm quitting.

I hear the dog really liked him.

Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.

I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --

Yeah.

It's... okay

Really?

You should see the one we wear when it rains.

Why?

No. Who?

Ohh...

Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?

Really? 

Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.

Come on, let's go.

Somewhere.

Are you all right?

No... Could you?

The what?

It's nice.

So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.

What?

That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.

She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --

It's me, Ed.

We'd better go...

I know.

No. Am I supposed to?

It's Ed.

The whole time? Eighteen years?

Oh, man! So...

Thanks... That's ...

Good?

What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?

Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.

Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.

I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals.

You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...

What kind of person?

Yeah, just --

Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.

You have the key, Mr. McAllister.

Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count.

Right

I thought you were supposed to keep them.

Looks like Tim Kobza.

Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!

Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"

You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.

Uh-huh.

Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?

You'll be fine.

Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.

Possibly.  Please just wait outside.

I did it.

I don't know. All I know is I did it I

Here?

Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.

Should we get a what?

Still clear?

Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.

You're there.

Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --

Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.

No way I It doesn't make sense.

And 290 "disregards," right?

Larry, you just take it easy

So?

Good luck to you too, Paul.

Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*

Paul, get out!

What do you want, Mr. Policeman?

No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?

Yes.  But do you know?

That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.

He's waiting for you to mention mention.

Yeah.

I'm not sure.

Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.

When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.

I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...

Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.

Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?

Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.

Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself

Homicide?  A detective?

How'd you get them to retract?

What work?

You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?

Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.

Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?

Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.

Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.

Get the fuck away from me.

Lynn.

<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.

The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.

They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.

It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.

Let's just kill them.

For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.

There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.

Which one are you and which one am I?

<u>Lynn</u>.

I'm not asking you.

He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.

Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.

I got her address.

And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?

Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.

I got a few Nite Owl questions.

<u>Ear plugs</u>.

I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.

Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.

Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.

They shot him in his library.

Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?

Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?

Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.

His blood's always up.

Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.

She may still be alive, whoever she is.

And now you'll provide them.

Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?

<u>Really</u>?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?

What's this all about, lad?

You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.

What?

Just don't shoot me.

Give me a minute, will ya?

I want you to follow Bud White.

What?

A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.

What?

I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.

A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.

Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.

Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?

Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.

I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.

Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.

Officer White?

You lost me, Sid.  Who?

Sid, how are they hanging?

What's he doing here, Sid?

And Reynolds?

What's wrong, Trash?

I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.

I just called it.

A bootleg...

You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.

Yes.

Nothing.

I don't know what that means.

So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?

Listen to me--

Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.

Be careful, Danny.

Why?

Rachel Banks?

I don't know who he is.

Told by whom?

Really?

The NSA?

And you won't. Now move--

They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.

Look, my wife is understandably--

I called from a payphone!

Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!

Jesus. Do you have proof?

'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please.

You sure?

Those are Feds.

That wasn't so hard.

Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?

So what do we do now?

What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.

What if--

What if we just fucked with 'em?

We'll have to re-stock some basics.

C'mon.

It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.

Are you sure about this?

Oh my God.

Neil, thank you for your help.

Hello. Hello, Maria.

Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--

I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...

Is that good?

I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.

Thanks.

A report?

That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.

I can't.

I'm not his attorney.

I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.

No.

Not that I could see.

To buy lingerie.

Listen to him.

Just for the criminals.

I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.

Something bad happened tonight.

In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.

"Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--

I know.

It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.

I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--

You opened the thing?

That was for Christmas.

It's a brand new card.

Don't count on it.

You didn't squeeze DePinto?

I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.

It tastes like fish.

I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.

Why?

All right, look--

What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?

It's not me?

We'd rather not--

And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?

Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel.

This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.

You're firing me.

Fuck off.

Why?

Dad!

Did you take <u>anything</u>--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.

Usually they take clothes.

An investigation? It was a bus accident.

Bobby--

Rachel's dead?

I have a family.

Go fuck yourself.

The police?

I honestly don't know.

You would?

Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.

You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.

We found the originals.

Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?

Hiding something?

So they know everything.

Do you have visual?

What kind of fossils?

I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?

Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?

Her or me?

I thought you might paste them into your book.

I'm quite all right, thank you.

Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.

You don't sew at all!

It's a folk song.

Shall we be all right?

Don't talk.

I promise I'll come back.  I promise I'll never leave you.  And there's plenty of water and food. You can have a party.

Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France.  The Devil's Chimney it was called -  The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why.  Darling.  My darling.

Still a car.

Appropriate?

Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.

What?

Sorry, what's your point?

Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.

Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.

I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.

Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy.  And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.

In my room.

What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.

Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.

Right.

I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.

Don't cut me.  Come on.

Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.

You were in Africa?

Where've you been?

Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?

I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?

I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.

I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.

I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.

Oh really?

But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?

Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.

Apprentices.

Oh no, really.  She has her book.

To arm-twisting.

I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.

Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.

Your friend?

You'd better be.

Never heard of it.



I've met you before.

You get Hardy.

I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.

Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.

Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?

He can't even move.

No.  He's - no.

Hello miss.

I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.

He's sleeping.

I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.

I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.

I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.

No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.

Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.

What's he saying?

What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.

How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?

This was your garden?

There are times when you don't answer the phone.

Through a window.

He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.

This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.

Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.

I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.

I'm going to get him, I promise you.

Who am I?

Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.

Then don't.

Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...

I'll call an ambulance.

It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.

You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.

No. Why would I be?

That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...

So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.

Possibly.

Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.

If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?

That's my girl.

Give him the card.

Look on the back. What do you see?

We're only going one way.

I'm not the one to ask...

You really don't believe I'd take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance?

I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.

I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.

I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.

Good morning.

We go underwater?

Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.

You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.

It was perfect.

No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.

Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.

We are...for the tools.

Try laps. Say a hundred.

Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.

Terrified. Still am.

My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.

Bookshelf. Sensors--

In eye of that painting.

The Mask.

No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.

Get the hell in.

Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?

My job, my rules.

But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.

It's no good without the argon gas.

No. You'll see when we get inside.

Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.

Have really held you under?

Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.

Oh, I don't care about the money.

What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?

The disc is still in there.

That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.

Which is--

Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.

The early bird gets the damn worm.

She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.

Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.

We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...

Probably not.

Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.

What the fuck did you do with my stuff?

Who?

So you say.

She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.

It was right up on the PG&E property over there.

Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.

For what?

And he's making them give five million of it to you all.

Any school you want.

Yup.

If you hadn't used profanity --

Yeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my kids.

I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.

Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.

Excuse me?

I guess I'm not the right kind.

Course I did.

Erin --

Erin --

And I realized, he's taking a chance too.

It's not about working hard --

Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.

They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.

No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --

Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.

It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.

Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?

It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go --

Uh-huh.

Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --

Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.

You're not gonna be there.

Say you were wrong.

Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all of 'em.

Corey.

Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...

Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.

Not anymore.

Ross -- you are an absolute angel.

Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.

I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".

You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.

Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.

Ten?

C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.

Better safe than sorry.

Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.

I didn't say that.

What do you want, a joke?

Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?

Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.

I'm real sorry, Laura.

What's going on?

<u>Excuse me</u>?

Uh-huh?

No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.

Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.

Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!

You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.

I feel The Force.

You won't.

What's wrong with him?

Okay, okay.

Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?

Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?

You know the Jedi Master?

Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?

Then I'll see you in Hell.

Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.

Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.

There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.

He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.

You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.

I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?

What was it?

What is it?

You mean a man you can control.

No lightspeed?

You're going to attack them?!!!

Who's staring?

Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...

Thanks to you.

Repairs ...

Hyperdrive.

Yeah, you're a real hero.

Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.

Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.

Not really.

You're part of the mining guild then?

Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.

Not yet.  They're working on it now.

We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.

So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.

Closer?!

Well, what now?

I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.

I've never seen it fail.

You are reckless!

You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.

No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.

No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.

That is why you fail.

The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.

Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.

Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.

It is the future you see.

I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.

You'll find I'm full of surprises.

No!

Never.

Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...

They're...pretending to dress.

But we saw Earth destroyed.

There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.

Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.

C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.

If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.

Having second thoughts?

So what does this thing do?

Yeah, I got it.

Where'd they go?

Delgado?

No way.

Right over there.

Don't like it, don't come.

Yeah, kinda.

If he lets you get close enough.

Where's... Cuervo Jones...?

Are you crazy?

You need help.

Thank God.

Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.

I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?

I sought only not to harm you, sir.

So be it, to the death.

Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.

I gave up my castles and my lands!

We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...

It is deep...

Of Merlin?

That's not why you came.

Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.

Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?

Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.

Never where you expect it, that's all I know.

My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.

I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.

Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--

Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!

We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go.

Ye...

I'm going.

If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.

You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.

No.

I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.

There is one.

You.

I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman.

--Nothing!

He has given up.

--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.

Why?

Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...

One land, one king! That is my peace!

I?

Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.

Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.

Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.

I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.

I see, your excellency.

And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!

You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...

You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?

In here!

Oh great, anything else?

No kidding.

Why don't you let me?

I can't believe it.

Me too.

No, she was heavily sedated.

Of course. Have you got a pen?

What's her name?

You're a nice man.

She is going to be well?

Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.

And those lies she's been telling?

Never.

Wait a minute. What are you talking about?

The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.

Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.

Yes am.

Pretty close.

Sure did.

He didn't mention her.

I beg your pardon?

Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.

Could you see her?

I thought you were supposed to be an expert.

Yes I did, I'm sorry.

What's the difference?

Yeah.

Captain Howdy.

Well, maybe he's sleeping.

I don't know

Well you know it's okay.

What?

I don't know, I just thought.

My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.

So something please Doctor, Help her!

That's good.

Okay.

I stole it.

There was nothing you could do. Lye down. C'mon.

Stealing is a sin.

No.

What an excellent day for an exorcism.

Bon Jour.

Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.

I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.

No we haven't met, but they said I could tell; that you looked like a boxer.

Yeah, a fall.

I don't know anyone who fits the description.

Come on!

Are you tired?

Just a minute.

Sometimes.

Your pay.

Suit yourself.

You bring trunks, Jack?

You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?

Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?

The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.

Oh.

Go fuck yourself.

Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.

I had a boy down at the camera shop cut them all together.  Boy, old man Henderson didn't fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, Jack?

Lotta water.

Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!

Fuck him.

I hate your kids, Frank.

Try the black Knable.

Only on odd days.

Funny.  Strike a bell?

No thanks.

It's me.

Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.

I don't know what you mean.

I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.

It wasn't like that.

Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.

Yeah, and what put him up there?

Talk.

You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.

It never was.

She'll get here.

Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.

Come on, stand still.

That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.

I'll take my chances.

Yeah.  Something.

Yeah, fine.

Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.

It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.

Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.

No, you take the right.

I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?

I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.

No. Why?

She's a big girl.

What?

We were just having a little discussion about morality.

Celebrating.  Join me?

A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.

Yeah.

You're making things up, Frank.

You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.

Twenty-eight years.

No.

I don't know. Some disease.

Seventy-one

Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.

Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?

What're you doing?

Later.

This'll kill 'em.

I can keep the beat.

All right.

Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.

Well, that's fine --

My watch is broken, too.

Impersonally.

You're an hour and a half late.

Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.

That's the premise.

Changed?

What's wrong with it?

My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.

Big feet.

They're nines.

You can buy new ones tomorrow.

So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.

He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.

Smells like fish.

Yeah.

Tell her.

People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.

No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?

In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.

Uh, well ...

Uh ... thanks.

Gotta go.

Funny job.

I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.

Come on, Ed.

Yeah.

Downstairs.

I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.

Frank works hard.

Pretty much.

The Stratford.

Nothing personal --

Every year.

Like a baby. You?

No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.

Hey, business is business.

Just dinner and dance, right?

Nothing.

How do you know?

Ed? How many people live here?

Soap?

You're kidding.

So, what happened?

If I see him.

Losing his teeth.

Is that what you used to do?

Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.

Looks old.

Why not?

Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?

Good to see you, Ma.

Huh? Oh, no.

Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."

What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?

Yeah -- me.

Drive.

My place.

Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.

Of course he is ...  -- He's yours too.

He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.

You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.

So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?

Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.

Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.

Is that what you think?

Must've been after we got engaged.

Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.

Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...

An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.

Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --

Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?

Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.

You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --

Not anymore.

You've given me the freedom I haven't had in years, and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought possible.  But hell -- this is America.  One day a pauper, the next day, a prince. And I owe it all to you. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, -- and a beautiful wife to fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean "make love to."

Five seconds.

Janie?

I won't tell mom if you don't.

Like you know anything about it.

That's your name, isn't it?

Get rid of them.

What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!

What?

Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!

Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.

You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?

There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.

Normally, I would.  But today ...

You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --

D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.

Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.

What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.

Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?

Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.

Back then -- who wasn't?

You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.

Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.

You?  Married?

Excuse me?

So you left her?  Just like that?

No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?

That'll be a nice little holiday treat.

Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?

Im sure you do...

What about me?

Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...

On a case by case basis...

Got it.  Good tip.

Thats where you work.

Thats good but...you did forget the anniversary.

No, honey. Go back to sleep.

I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...

I dont think so.

I just saw Evelyn Thompson.

Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...

What the hell are you talking about?  Whats he talking about?

Damn, you are the real thing...

Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?

Me?

Thats my car!  You stole my car!

Figure it out?  Figure what out?!

You know what the word glimpse means, J? Its by nature an impermanent thing.

You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!

Get out, I call 911.

It would help me if we were.

Okay, chief.

Howd you do this year, Tony?

For us, Kate.

Yeah...fine.

Trust me on this Kate.  I really dont think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.

Funny, Jack.  Im laughing on the inside.

Well thats just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...

I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, theres no question about that.  But this...  ...youve really grown into a beautiful woman...

She got those shoes...

Really.

Thats why I work for Big Ed?

No, open it...

Zeena...

What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until its light out.

Okay...

I guess...some of them are probably faking.

Im out of the doghouse?

Its like a museum.

What are you talking about, Jack?

I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  Well put Annie and Josh in private schools...

Look, youre making this into something its not. This isnt a referendum on our lives, Kate. Its a step forward...  Dont you see?  Im talking about us finally having a life other people envy.

Dont worry about it, Jack...

Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and Im going to be heading it up.

Jack.

Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, Ill be fine...

That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...

Where is he?

Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.

Youre a little tougher, Peter.

Of course I did.

So we'll get egg nog.

I've got plenty of places to go.

Merry Christmas...

Yes!

Congratulations. The La Guardia flights canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?

Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?

Trust me, this ain't one of those times.

My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.

You'd never know it.

External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --

Victor's better at these things.

<u>Should</u>?

I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?

I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.

If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.

Got it, teach.

Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.

Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.

Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.

And you can?  Power it up?

What do you mean "complete"?

What about you?

Ben!  Ben!

You've been working out.

I can go hotter!

What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --

Right, whatever, have fun.

But all these people...

Last one down springs for room service.

<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.

Johnny.

You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --

At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.

It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.

Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --

<u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not <u>mine</u>."

Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --

Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...

It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.

Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.

The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.

And reverse the mutations --

You <u>were</u>?

I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.

I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.

Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...

Raising the shields.

Susan.  What are you doing?

That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --

But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!

Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.

Message to Proteus.

I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.

The Other Side got to him.

We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.

They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.

Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.

Can't remember?... What do you mean?

That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.

Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.

They're much smaller than bacteria...

Dr. Michaels is right. We have no choice.

We're pushing oxygen today.

You may learn to like it.

No, it requires such absolute precision --

Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.

That's what they pay me for.

I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!

Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!

Yes...

Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?

Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.

I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.

You mean Inner Space is endless?

A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.

Oxygenation...

Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?

If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...

What about Dr. Michaels?

If there's any chance --

There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.

Send the following message...

We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.

I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?

That line was tampered with...

Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.

Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.

Sorry, but the situation has changed.

I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?

Where we going?

I'm married.

Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...

We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.

Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?

Yes, by all means. We must try it.

Then don't drift down further.

We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.

I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.

Certainly -

...What're you talking about?

Yeah.

We split that.

The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.

The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?

Oh, for Chrissakes here -

Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.

Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -

Oh, yah, I know that!

Uh-huh.

I unnerstand.

Oh sure.

What'd this guy look like anyways?

Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.

Yah, got a front movin' in.

Uh-huh... A what?

Chaska.

In what way?

Jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.

No. No, ma'am.

Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.

Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...

I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating... There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...

Dad's here.

That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -

Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.

Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -

Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.

I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -

No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -

Okay.

Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..

This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.

Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.

My patience is at an end.

Good day, sir.

Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?

Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?

Whatcha watchin' there?

I know it's a lot.

We might be innarested.

No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -

Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.

Nope.

Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.

Yah.

Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.

No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.

Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.

That's okay, hon. I gotta run.

Aw, you can sleep, hon.

Aw, Norm.

Yah?

Just a Diet Coke.

It sounds like you're doin' really super.

I'm sorry.

No, I didn't...

I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you...

Yah, is this Marge?

Margie Olmstead?

Norm?

No.

No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.

Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.

Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.

Love ya, Margie.

Thanks, hon.

Oh, fine.

It's terrific!

When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!

His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.

Well -

Bob, Bob... I'm a member.

Yeah, both of us.

Have you finished those reports?

Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!

Does this sound strange to you?

Dynamite?

This is... really a shock...

Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.

I'll expose you.

I suppose.

Marla?

Please.

Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.

I could check your prostate.

It was the smart move on her part.

Hear what?

That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?

Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!

Can I come in?

Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!

Answer the question!

Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.

I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.

No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...

Yes.

I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...

You fucking slut!!

Yes... it's a test.

What?

Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...

Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.

Pardon me?

Tyler Durden.

No, supply oxygen?

The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.

It affords him other interesting opportunities.

This is crazy.

Strange.

Is it?

Anyone?

Hum.

He was obviously able to handle it.

No.  Not at all.

She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.

You've gotta understand something about me.  I have a little rule, okay?  Don't ever talk to her about me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind of shit.

No, I'm not...

Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.

I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.

Hey.

What should I have told you?

You know what I mean.

If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?

If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.

Why do people think I'm you?

You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...

I'm going to...

Stop finishing...

I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.

Defuse the bomb, please.

I think this is about where we came in.

Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....

Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. 

Proceed with remote detonation.

Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...

I swear on my life, I won't...

It's the only way to get rid of you...

What?

What?

Well, sir, you said you might.

No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.

No!

We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

It's free to all.

No, please, no, God, no!

I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.

I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.

Signs?

What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?

I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.

Taken care of.

Random, sure.

Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.

Carter.

Blow me.

Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.

Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.

Take my van!

I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.

There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.

...My Premonition was just like his.

Who is this guy, anyway?

I don't...what if I made a mistake?

Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.

I...I don't know.

I guess so.

Hey, Dad.  What's up?

What feeling?

I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.

I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.

As in flannels and plaids?

Thirty-nine.

They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...

Let us out!

Easy, Billy, just open it.

Get out! Get out of the car!

I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!

Really?  How come he didn't take me?

No.

Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.

Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.

This is state-of-the-art firepower.

There are no worse places.

Powerful warrior.

Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.

Guard barracks.  Take some shots.

What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.

I suppose you have...

Duck soup.

I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.

Oh.  They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.

They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.

Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.

Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.

Sorry, Sir.

Not yet.

Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.

Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.

Christ almighty.

Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.

It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.

Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.

It's not over.  You made one mistake.

I could take it or leave it.

Yeah.  Big time.

This just occurred to somebody, now?

I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.

Got any more bread crust?

This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.

I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!

Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.

I smell gas... Do you smell gas...

I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --

Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...

And who's Lydia?

Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.

First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?

Then what do you want to stay with me for?

I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...

I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...

NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  Leave me alone!!

You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.

Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.

Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?

Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...

Lydia.  Lydia what?

Great place huh?

My name is Parry.

They're --  -- What?

Sshhhh!

The Little People?

Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.

But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.

God... I'm the janitor of God.

Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.

But I can't get it... He's...

Parry!

I don't know.

Can I take you to lunch?

So what? You going to help me?

Who?

Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?

Bingo!

What?

Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.

You advise us!

There isn't any more to tell.

No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.

You don't have to say that.

I leave it to you.

Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?

No, dammit, I would easy.

No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...

You'll be gone, period.

No.

Who said I was depressed?

You're lucky no one was hurt.

What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?

But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?

I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.

Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.

Are you talking to us?

This is a very special, very old CB 275...

Very nice.

Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?

Yeah, me, too...

Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.

Uhm hmm.

I don't know.

Sailors are sadistic, I feel.

Where's Catherine?!

Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...

I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.

Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.

Yeah, I'll probably be free.

Of course I do. It's music. You know...

At being a fake.

No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.

Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.

I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you... Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.

I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...

That's right.

That's what you said?

I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?

I'll be back later...

No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...

I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.

What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.

And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...

The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.

Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.

Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.

Victor.

Nothin'.

I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.

I just wanted to see you.

Just chill.

Nah, we make out and stuff.

I buy them flowers.

I did.

Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.

I can't man, I'm punished!

I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,

Pitt.

If we were at 10th Street Pool you woulda done it right in the water, right?

Which one?

For real?

You gonna talk to him?

Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.

Yeah.

She's like this high, dark hair, skinny

Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.

So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?

Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.

Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.

It was planted on me, sir.

Not a prayer.

Thank God, the police.

Go ahead. Make my evening.

Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?

Yes.

One. B-a-b-a-r.

No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.

Joan or Margaret Smith.

I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.

No idea.

Okay. Some idea.

Like tonight.

Affirmative.

That's it?

He'll be so relieved.

Harry S. Truman?

Check.

What the hell does this have to do with insurance?

I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.

I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.

Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.

In this drawer....

Don't say shoot, okay.

Not me.

That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while.

Nothing to it.

I'm sorry?

No, thank you.

I love the outfits.

I have this effect on lots of women.

You are a rich woman.

Can I borrow your towel for a minute?

Here, take mine.

It's amazing.

Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...

Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.

He never sees them and I never met them.

That's what I want to know.

Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --

Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?

I'll take you to a game.

I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.

I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.

Gail, please.

I checked. There was no divorce.

Bastard.

Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?

Cabana one.

Very good, sir.

I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.

Moved out.

All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.

Get out of here.

What?  Who the hell are they?

Not really?

Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.

Of course.

I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...

Excuse me?

Oh... I have some questions.

Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...

I'll do my best.

Right away!

Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!

Go on, 'they're stahting.'

Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.

Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.

Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.

Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.

Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!

Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.

I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.

Peachy.

Why are all these people after me?

I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!

Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?

Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.

But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.

Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.

I'll mail you a letter, come on!

Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.

Why am I what?  Excuse me?  I catch you saying the F-word again.  I'll kill you.  That's a fucking promise.  Now get the fuck out of here.

What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?

Shut the heck up... Pop.

Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?

Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...

You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.

I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'

Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.

Let me go out like a man.

Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!

When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.

I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.

I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.

Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.

What?

I'm clean.

There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.

No, nothing.  There's only some talk.

Where do you want it?

You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?

You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.

Encore du sho ping!

Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.

Il fallait le faire.

He is not wrong.

It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.

Yeh?  Who else?

Marseilles.

I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.

Strike out, eh?

How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?

Not a chance.

Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.

What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?

Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.

There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.

Forty dollars -- was $250.

For garbage?

Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.

Nothing.

Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.

Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.

We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.

Hey, bud.

Well, why not a little of the King?

You alright?

You didn't marry Donna Reed.

Did he?

I tucked him in at Gordo's.

I love you more.

Wish you weren't.

I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!

Hello, Frank.

I think you know, Frank.

Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.

Let's go.  Do us both a favor.

Do you know where I found this?

No.  This isn't what you think.

I know.  Sorry, Dad.

WB2YKXB, who've I got?

Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.

I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.

I got fed up with all the bullshit.

Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.

Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.

I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.

I don't know.

Sun spot?

1998.

I never knew you, Dad.

Something happened, something...

She...she died.  It's like it just happened.

October 22, 1969.

Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.

Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.

No.

What?

What...

Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.

Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.

Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.

I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...

Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.

This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...

I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.

Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.

Yeah, that's right.

She's pretty special.

I try to be.

A hot shot, huh?

Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!

Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.

Where's Shelly?

Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.

We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.

If you insist.

I'll think of something.

I vote for me.

I love you, man!

I can't even remember what day it is, man.

Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.

It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.

I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.

Your bed.

I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?

You're irresistible.  I lose control.

Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.

Somebody was in here.

Sure, just watch where you're going.

My whole world.

May be please have the wallet.

Just keep your eyes on the road.

Don't say any more.

Being a jerk is better than being nothing.

Go out and plug the cord back in.

We're gonna scare him?!

That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.

He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?

Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.

You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.

This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...

It's just beginning.

Come and get it.

It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.

I hope so.

Why?

We'll scare 'em right back.

Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.

No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?

I think somebody's messin' around out there.

Yes.

So let's talk.

The what?

Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?

Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...

You know what I want.  You know why I need you.

It's going.

Maybe you should mind your own business.

She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.

Sorry.

Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...

Next, you dial a number.

Never.

Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.

Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night. You've got your whole life to be uptight.

I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.

There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?

Hear what?

It's...dead.

She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...

I packed it. Just for us.

No, I think it's just the beginning.

Where is she?

Walking corpses are not real!

I'm staying.

I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.

I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.

I don't know what to say...

It's not that simple.

Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.

The window...

Please, hurry...

Where you're going, mister?

Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.

This is a great young out-of-work actress.

Shut up, Elliot.

She wants a divorce.

You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.

Do we care?

No, we're not.

He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.

There are things that speak to us from the past.

The American theater doesn't need people like that.

Unbelievable.

This could be it.

I hear Alan's sick.

Can he get through it?

They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.

The Red Sox

Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.

This is how we've managed to last.

We don't even like each other, do we?

The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?

It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.

I go to college. I thought you knew.

There's nothing left for me to lie about.

A flat-out hit.

Yes.

I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.

An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.

And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.

How prominent?

I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.

That's always been my problem.

You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.

I'd forgotten that.

They're always winning. Until they lose.

Washed away.

What did it say?

Get yourself something to eat.

Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.

They're only gonna lose.

I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.

Show him who we are.

It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.

It's a simple subject.

Matthew.

Why do you care?

No. They're not your team. They're my team.

You're out of bullets.

I have excellent long-term memory.

What color?

Burnt sienna.

I kissed her while she was laughing.

I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.

I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?

A little.

A little drastic maybe?

Is what true?

Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.

Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.

Where are you going now?

Yes.

Everyone takes his turn.

"I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people."

"I will follow you in all our vows and duties."

Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.

I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.

Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.

Some of it good, I hope.

Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?

Did they take your clothes?

Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.

No, no -- just a moment, please.

Panditji -- please, help me.

Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?

Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.

No.

That was England.

I dined at the prison.

Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.

Not yet, I'm afraid.

I'll see what I can do.

Grudges?

So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.

Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.

Blood.  From the vein.

Something's not right.

No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.

I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?

You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?

<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.

I'm proud of you, Vincent.

Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.

I'm sorry.  I've got plans.

I could always walk.  I've been faking it.

I hope he's not just a body.

They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.

No.

You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.

I'm not doing it.

Antonio--

Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch.

I heard about you. You work with Miller.

Stay clean.

And you got him...

One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.

No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.

I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.

I've been doing my homework.

Assumed name... Houston.

Just the way I remembered.

It's all right.

We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you.

Better than I remembered.

I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.

Usually on the right side as you go in.

Bullshit.

Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --

There are three men dead.

I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.

You sent me to him.

What do we do?

And switched keys.

You bastard...

No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.

Why, there's nothing on the news?

When are you going to learn?

Let's do it.

I think so... I don't know.

I don't want to hear it.

You and me.

Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.

Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.

We walk.

Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?

Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.

No, I'm afraid not.

Oh my God.

Thanks. Hope you do too.

Tell her you robbed a bank...

Two boxes of double-ought buck.

Might try that.

Where?

Okay. How many bank exits?

Whatever you need.

Just sandwiches...

Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.

Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.

Not now.

What's it to you?

Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.

Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.

That right?

How long have you been married?

That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.

I'll tell you when.

I know.

Who?

Yes. I told him.

'Good.'

Was the steering faulty?

Fine. Nowt wrong with them.

He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.

You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.

I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.

You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?

Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?

On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.

I can't.

He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.

Who?

Really?

No. I didn't know that.

Sure I'm sure.

Yeah.

No.

No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.

No. It's all right.

Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.

Working at Woolworths.

Wilton Estate.

Why would it?

Yeah. He comes in here a bit.

Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.

That little shit!

What, and get myself beaten up again?

Not much.

A bereavement. A death in the family.

Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?

Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?

Piss off, Ray.

Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?

They do that up North.

Knock it off, Gerald.

Shut up.

...Polacks...

I'm not?

I'd never try to sell an Indian.

I...I don't know.

What?

We're stuck with this fucking shit...

You get a bad month, all of a...

It's not right.

No.

Nurses.

With River Oaks?

No, it's not that simple, Dave...

What hard part?

What?

That's the truth...

When they...

How?

What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.

The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.

Graff?  Because I worked for him.

We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.

Have I said that?

What?

You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...

I'm sorry?

They'll know when you go over to Graff...

I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.

What?  You can't do any what?

Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.

Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.

Yes.  The cops.  No.

When I talk to the police, I get nervous.

No, who?

Why?

We had a robbery. 

That they're going to be upset.

I didn't...why should I..."Where were you last..." Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...?

Did they find the guy who broke into the office yet?

...did they...

Could I...

...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.

Not lately it isn't.

It isn't me...

Murray...

You're saying that I'm fucked.

...apart from the top men on the contest board.

What if you don't close...?

I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...

I can't split them.

The deal still stands, our other thing.

Somebody broke in.

The leads are coming.

I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...

It's not impossible.

I don't know what you are saying.

I...

Uh-huh?

I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.

You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. 

No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.

I'm sorry.

Eighty-two thousand dollars.

"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."

"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"

Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 

That's right.

Last night, this morning.

"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...

...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.

What is it?

No, Mr. Roma.  I don't need the time, I've made a lot of investments in the last...

Go ahead.

Kenilworth...?

I'm coming, Ray...what a day!  I'll call you this evening, Jim.  I'm sorry you had to come in...Monday, lunch.

One moment, I'll be right with you.  In fact, a...one point, which I spoke to you of which  I can't talk to you about here.

Mm.

Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...

I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock. 

I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...

Tuesday.

The check wasn't cashed?

We're going to speak to her.

I do.  If I don't get my money back...

Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.

I...

The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?

She told me not to talk to you.

I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.

The...

Some of them...

Yes.

To the restaura...what do you fucking...?

With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...

'Cause I don't have to eat this month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to me...  Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all...

If you don't want it, give it back.

The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...

Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.

Yes.

That's right.

The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;

That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.

 He's going to kill Fanucci.

Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?

Because I need MONEY!

Tom is right.

Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.

It's not talk; I'm doing it.

That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.

He will grow strong.

 You must understand, this is all new to me...

We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.

I want you to help me, Fredo.

I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.

I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother.

It was Frankie tried to have me hit.

What's that?

I've always taken care of you.

You're nothing to me now, Fredo; not a brother, not a friend, I don't want to know you, or what happens to you.  I don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home.  When you visit our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there.  Do you understand?

You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.

When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.

I can't let him down.

The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.

My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.

Wait... there's something else.

It was a boy.

Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.

Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?

Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.

Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.

We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.

Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.

Very well.

The witness is excused; take him out.

If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.

Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.

It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.

I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.

I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?

And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.

You would have killed his brother?

You haven't heard me.

The baby I lost...

It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out!  It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil.  I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world.  An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!

Who's asking?

Right here.

Get out of my hotel.

Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?

The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of. I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I'm going to do with you, just in case.

Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.

No, I'm fine.

He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.

Let him gamble.

No.

That is a complete falsehood.

That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.

I do not.

When do we talk?

We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.

Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!

I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them.

No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.

I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?

Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?

I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.

Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.

And?

Sitting right behind you.

I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.

Not anymore you don't.  Doll.

What's to be jealous of?

Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.

You liked it too.

If you enjoy it, you should do it.

I'm not a kid.

Expect nothing fancy.

Why?

He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.

Mornin'.

No.  Iced tea's fine.

But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?

What did she mean by going flooey?

You mean, like posed for pictures?

Broke is more like it.

You mean -- you really want to draw me?

You don't say?  Which picture?

Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man."  Shall we begin?

No.  I'm fine.

What?

I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.

I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.

All right, I guess.

Go ahead.

Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.

Not at the moment.

In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.

What happened?

Do you miss it?

You've done a helluva lot more than most people.

You don't want me to sit for you anymore?

I'm game.  Sure.

Do I look okay?

If that's okay?

David produced her last picture.

Run for what?

Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.

Good.  Let's get dry.

Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.

What happened?

Your friend?

What won't do?

Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.

What was that?

You're crazy.

No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.

Fuck off!

I think I'll hang around.

I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.

I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.

Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.

Yes.  Perfectly.

Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.

But you appear quite fresh, my dear.

Yes?

Go.

She is beautiful.

Of course.  This afternoon.

No.  I expect you can't.

Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.

Sure.

No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.

You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?

Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?

He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.

I just need to -- lie down. Studio.  Daybed in studio.

I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.

Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.

Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?

Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.

Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?

About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --

A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?

Who do you think?

We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...

No, but you dress like an asshole ...

Me, too. Every time I walk...

Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on

My version of "take this job and shove it..."

How ya doing?

Yes ... Kip ...

I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...

Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...

"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...

Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...

One more night --

This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?

But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --

I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...

How is he?

How's Atley -- ?

Get out of here, then. Now.

You know my back.

Something like that -

Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...

Consider me gone, Detective --

Keys were in it ...

You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.

Good.

Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?

That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...

It's all microchips and shit ...

Hey, Donny --

Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business

Peugot convertible ...

You know where the others are?

Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?

Dignity...

one minute -- !

That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis?

It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"

Atley Jackson came to see me ...

Yes, sir -

It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...

You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?

What am I supposed to do?

Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?

Me.

Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...

I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...

"Shadow games?"

Thank-you ...

Nah.

I don't know. What -- ?

Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.

No problem -

Now, we go -

Run it...

Hell, yeah. Ten larger man

Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.

Mitch.

If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...

Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ...

I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...

Okay.

No way ...

No ...

Oh, yeah.

Deodorant.

I take out my slim-jim...

They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...

What about The Club ... ?

Yeah ... You -- ?

Hello, Otto ...

Are you considering a comeback tour?

In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...

Who's "Eleanor?"

Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --

No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.

Me? Why would I get into that shit?

Paulie. Why would I? I swear.

Nods.

I've been all fucked up since I got out.

She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.

He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.

I'm in construction.

What bag?

The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?

It'll be okay.

I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.

What did he say, exactly?

Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.

You know. The stuff I left.

Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?

Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.

Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.

What lions? I'm not going near any lions.

He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.

What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.

You're some fucking jerk.

They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?

Yeah.

I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.

He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.

There's a shovel at my mother's.

It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?

Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.

He's with his friends.

But, Paulie, please.

No, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home. Fuckin' lights and everything!

Fuck you, you fat fuck.

Oh great, tell her that! Now she really thinks we're problem drinkers!

Probation, counselin', few days a week.

Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.

She went to Medical school in California.

Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?

No, I had to talk him down.

Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude. I'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em. You know how many people try to whip Morgan's ass every week? Fuckin' kid won't back down.

Yah, it's not a bad school...

Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY

Well, I don't have no trousers on...

NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!

Shut up.

What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!

The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.

--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.

Allegedly, what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now.

Good, it was all right.

Seven.

Down there.  And I'm nervous.

Yeah, can I help you?

Fuck do you want?

I don't know what it's called.

I'm pretty sure it's right.

That's fine, but did you ever think--

So am I.  Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I wish I never met you. Because then I could sleep at night. I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. And I wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away.

Hey, how you doin'?

I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.

Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.

Find out what?

--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.

To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.

Not at all.

I think so.

--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.

Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.

I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!

He was my roommate in college.

The boy was here. He came in, sat down and we worked together.

Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.

Hold up.

Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.

Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.

You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free.

What did you think?

How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?"

I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.

So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right?

Fine.

I don't know.

No, I don't.

You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.

You're kiddin' me.

What did I think?

What?

Define that.

Yeah.

Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...

Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.

It's not your fault.

Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.

Yeah, I think so.

Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?

No.

Not far from here, South Boston.

Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance.

Not tonight.

Fine.

Clearly.

Some, a little.

How do you know that?

'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.

I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.

At least you have a mother.

What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?

Goodbye.

Listen, Smart Guy. I'll run my business my own way. I got work. If you wanta take it, okay. If not, just sit here, that's all.

I never knowed they was anything like her!

Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.

Let 'er go, Gallagher!

Be glad to get my han' on some cotton. That's the kin' a pickin' I understan'.

How 'bout you?

But ef you *do* whup me, I swear you better not ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you're settin' down, or your back's turned, I'm gonna knock you belly-up with a bucket.

Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?

I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.

I guess that's what he looked like.

Sure, but what is this?

Why, I guess so.

Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?

An' you say no cops?

You got dances too?

Say, who runs this place?

Why ain't they more like it?

Why, you're the preacher!

Have a little snort?

Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.

Just around that next bend.

They never wrote you nothing?

I never heard nothin' about it.

I ain't no preacher anymore.

What you figger to do?

We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.

I don't know.

Casy! What you doin' here?

No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.

Can't you see that sticker?

Yeah.

Naw--not much!

Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.

Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.

Didn' you have no breakfast?

I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.

I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.

Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.

Sure. We aim to.

I'll walk back.

You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.

You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.

Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.

No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.

Now don't get sassy, Ma.

Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!

Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--

They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place.

No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.

Okay, Ma. Don't you worry.

They killed Casy first.

I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.

He was a good man.

Then what, Tom?

Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?

Good-by, Tommy.

Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?

I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.

But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!

Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.

Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.

I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.

Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.

We can pick anything.

Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.

Yeah...

Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.

I'm Martin Blank.

What?

You could've been a contender, huh?

What do you want to do?

You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.

Here is now there. There is here.

Unbelievable.

This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.

Okay... Hold on...

What?

Like love?

Jesus Christ!

Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....

Come on.

So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?

Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.

Like a club. Work less, make more.

No harm no foul.

I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.

Nope.

I guess.

--Nooo--

-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.

No...

Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.

This?

Would you describe their position as inflexible?

I'll do it tomorrow.

It's fine.

He sold me this bad boy.

He gave me a great deal.

I was catching up with Bob Destephano.

That's too bad.

See you in ten years.

Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --

You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?

Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?

Branding?  I haven't branded in years.

What's that to miss?

Does Chicago count?

It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.

Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.

Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.

Huh?

How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?

Why?

I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!

I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.

Fine!

Maybe they should put me down too.

I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?

I didn't know I had to.

No, you just act like you do.

Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?

Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.

You're right. Good.

About what?

Yeah, you know everything!!

Tom's gone.

Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.

So do you.

I should be in by two.

Sure... What's Grace up to?

She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...

No, let me go.

Sing it to me, Frankie!

Yeah.

About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...

I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...

I can't say he's been all that effective with her.

I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.

I know. We miss you too.

About what?

Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.

You're allergic to hay.

You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.

May I have a suggestion?

I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...

We have a business manager. The best around.

Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?

It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.

Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.

Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.

Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.

Yes, it does.

I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.

Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.

Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.

It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?

Sure. As long as she don't mind.

Weekend after next...

Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.

Yeah.

I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?

Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.

I don't know if I can with my leg.

I don't know if I can.

No, you're only going to hurt him some more.

Can I come? I'll start a fire...

NO!

I want to see Pilgrim.

You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!

Oh yeah...

I understand...

Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.

Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.

I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.

Sometimes.

What do you mean?

Hack the Planet!

Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something.

Again?  Yeah sure.

Yo, brain dead, the manual!

Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.

Curtis.

Dead?

Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.

Yeah, mom?

Revenge.

That's bullshit.

Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.

Burn!

What's this one eat?

Joey's getting stupid busy.

We did it!

Pool on the roof must have a leak.

Make it my first born.

I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.

Okay. I'll copy it.

Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.

What?

You would have looked better.

Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?

It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...

Sorry, I can't help you, okay?

Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.

We caught 'em.

As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?

One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...

Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...

Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love,  sex, secret and...  ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password?

What, it left a note?

Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.

I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.

I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.

Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.

I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.

Not everything. But enough to implicate us.

No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.

All right.

My parents baby-sitter canceled.

Don't get angry.

No, you don't understand.

Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.

Not without Jamie.

No. You son of a bitch!

You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.

I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.

Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.

Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.

I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.

How many people in the bus?

I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.

Drive Carefully.

Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.

Do you love me Rachel?

Like a sister?

Like a real sister?

Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.

In a second.

I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.

Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.

I've got you come on, go down.

All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key.

Don't you mean what you do best?

No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.

I don't want to look pushy.

Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.

Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.

The state police won't know how to stop him.

Right here, Ben.

This is 132, over.

Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...

He's here, Sheriff.

All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?

All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.

He's been here.

Be here in a minute.

Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah

Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.

Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede shoes. Would you like a drink? 

Now you understand?

All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.

I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.

I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?

I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.

Bye.

I wasn't spooked.

I'd say you must have the wrong number.

This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...

He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.

Here, Lester.

Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...

Just answer the damn phone.

Yeah.

Are you sure?

Lee Brackett.

I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.

The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...

Totally.

No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.

Have a good time.

Sure.

Sure.

See you.

Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?

There was no one outside.

What did he look like?

And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.

You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.

He'll barely be able to sit up.

Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.

The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...

Oh, listen...

Mmm?

I can't believe it!

Well, let's hope so.

Oh--

Uh --

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah, I, we both live downtown.

I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.

Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?

No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.

Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.

We're actresses.

What makes you think we're more interesting?

I cry at the opera.

Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?

Well...

Yes.

Let's take a look.

No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.

Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?

Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.

Well, are...are they big?

Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!

Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.

Oh, what, in this section of town?

Yes, I do.

Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.

Well, i-if-if you have some free time...

Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.

Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...

Oh, don't say those words!

Why, you know the situation.

Not because of me, I hope.

I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.

I know it isn't.

Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.

It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.

Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.

I don't know.

But, you got four children!

Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.

And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!

Yeah.

Always.

It's on the table, Dad.

No, thank you.

I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.

Yeah.

Oh, Frederick!

Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!

You know... 

No--

I can't keep my mind on the show.

Like what?!  What?

Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!

Yeah...but you're not dying!

Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.

I think they're fantastic.

He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test. 

Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.

I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.

I got two minutes.

Here, you guys.  Open them up.

Thanks, thanks.

True.

Oh, sure.

Yeah.

Here.  Be careful with those.

Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?

No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.

They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.

Well-well, like what?

I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer."  I mean--

You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!

Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.

You're grateful, but you resent me.

I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.

I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.

You want some?

But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.

Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!

And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?

Yeah.  Me, too.

...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.

I'm fine.

Yeah, it was.

Well, I hope you've changed.

Probably not.

Yeah.

Really?

You have.

Oh.  Oh.

Yeah.

Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.

Yeah.

Just a few minutes ago.

Mmm, what?

God.

You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.

Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?

...I was <u>working</u>...

Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?

I have not read you your rights.

Orderly.

Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.

Say it in English.

You want me to be?

...they did it for a lark.

Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.

Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.

You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....

~Don't shoot, G-Men..."

Then I'm doing fine.

...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.

They got that kind of money?

Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.

You spend the afternoon in Bed?

Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>? 

Show me the Pigs.

Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling.  He will come to her.

OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.

No.  And...

Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.

Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 

...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...

Mmm...

Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...

We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.

He requests your presence, once again, as part of...

I'm going to work for your reinstatement...

Well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, <u>without</u> the Felon, with<u>out</u> the gun...

Well, you know, that happens, on the street.

Said what?

I said sometime it gets so...

'bout time you <u>learned</u>...

I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...

Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?

...yes, yes, yes...

Where do you live?

No. 

Oh, no, no.  It won't be <u>that</u> long.

Sir, with all due respect....

Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)

...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...

Thanks to <u>you</u>...

...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...

...but will that satisfy you?

...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...

I want the <u>same</u> drink.  Cause it did me <u>good</u>... but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like another.

Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...

N'not <u>that</u> sad.

...<u>what</u>...?

...and that is what you need to expand.

Oh, my <u>program</u>...

Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...

I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 

Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin <u>home</u>, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to <u>take</u> her there...

Dottore Fanelli...

No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.

...no...

What does <u>that</u> mean?

I want to do something <u>positive</u>...

...why?

And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...

No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?

Because?

And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?

<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. 

Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.

That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.

Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.

I'm not really a--Does it count if...

They wouldn't be a bit surprised..

Uh, yeah, that's...wow.

Man, it's not like I don't know about women. I had this babysitter...

It's about time. Isn't Fun great?

Why am I so--That's new--The way I figure it is if I can get through to just one camper...then I'm a pretty incompetent counselor.                                           ] Don't get caught. I'll deny                                 ] everything.                                                 ]

Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.

You and Wichita go to school together, right?  Have you two ever...

The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.

Clever observation. Go back to Wichita.  Oh that's right, you can't.

Yeah. And?

Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up!  Isn't Fun great!

Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...

Talia, you're a wonderful person...

So what?                                                    ]

Yes you do.

Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.

It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...

Oh my gosh, why didn't you say something earlier...

Do you really think I care?

Not now, Wendy.

Stop!  Stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought...I overheard you and Pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the "test"...Do you believe me?

Thank you, my love.                                         ]

I'm just thinking I'm glad I broke up with everyone I ever went out with.  The swelling is gonna go down, right?

That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.

Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.

Don't get cocky, girl.

It's not my style, okay?

No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.

It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.

Hey, don't run away now.

You're beautiful.

In my heart, Heather's still alive.

Like last night, Veronica?

Because you're an idiot.

I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?

Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.

Color me nauseous.

He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.

King David.

Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...

Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.

Yeah, maybe.

Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?

Heather.

You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.

No.

Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!

Yeah, I just got back.

Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.

Uh-huh.

Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.

So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?

But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?

Sure.

No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.

I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.

Chick-en.

Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...

"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."

Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.

They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.

Oh.

I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.

Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.

What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?

Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.

You didn't say Simon Says.

What?

I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?

May<u>be</u>. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.

Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.

sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.

pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.

Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.

Well? Tell us! How'd it go?

I'm not hungry.

sighs.

grabs Pauline by the shoulders.

I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.

I don't wanna be in bloody school!

That's enough, Yvonne!

Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.

Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.

turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.

Mummy!

Him . . .

That . . .

You're such an incredible woman.

That idiot boarder?

Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.

You mean travel by ourselves?

Mummy!

I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!

Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.

Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...

You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.

Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...

Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.

Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.

Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.

You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.

Well?

No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.

Just get better okay?

Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...

Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?

Really? Do tell.

Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.

Someone special.

Ambrose. I know.

I said she's been missing for-

What's the difference?

How many zeros was your wife worth?

Uh... eighty two?

Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?

I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.

I'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.

Where is she? Where is my wife?

That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.

Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-

Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-

I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...

I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.

Uh... sure, Tawny... what?

I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.

In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.

They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?

Talk from there.  You can talk from there.

I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...

I was in the can, for Chrissake.

Right.

Huh?  Whadda you mean?

Bernie.  Call me Bernie.

Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.

I took a loan on my car and my computer.

I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..

My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.

You mean like Bubber?  The hero?

He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...

He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...

Lie, you mean...

Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.

Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.

Thanks.  Thanks, pal.

I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.

You were saying you don't want a million dollars.

All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?

John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.

No, I don't have the right.  You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!

A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...

Bodybuilding!

Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.

You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!

"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."

Unprofessional.

You're sitting on your ticket.

Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?

WHAT?  THEY FOUND WHAT?

What's "cynical"?

We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...

Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.

Who?

Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- <u>nothing</u>.  I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>, they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle...  ... then look out.

Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.

Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.

It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.

Right.

Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.

Who doesn't?

Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.

I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.

Maybe I could take a look at it now.

Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.

Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.

I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.

Because you <u>were</u> pretty?

Uh huh.

Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.

"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"

Bye, Neil!

No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.

I've asked him what's wrong.

The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.

Here, take this out to the table.

You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.

It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on.

Oh -- great.

Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?

There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.

Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.

Where should I hide the car keys?

Did you lock the garage door?

Philip!  The senior partner?

I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.

No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.

Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.

Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!

Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?

No joke, Lieutenant.

Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.

Not now.  I'm busy.

Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.

I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.

Most people are afraid of death.

Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?

Aye.

Leaving what?

For what?

If it came down to it what would you do?

No -- I will.

I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?

I would like to say goodbye.

Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?

I cannot explain.

Are you a cop?

Jennifer.

I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.

--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?

Why?

And this?

I was working on the cataloging.

It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?

I can take care of myself.

Aye -- that I would, lass.

I love you, Conner.

I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.

Why?

You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.

My dreams died long ago.

If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.

No.  The money, please.

Yes, sir.

Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.

I'll make the call.

Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.

If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.

I'm going to my desk.

Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?

Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?

For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!

Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.

Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.

I'm here.

What?

The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.

Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.

Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?

There's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million.  I'll give you half.

Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.

They'll cut the power.

Dennis.

Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --

Okey-doke.

My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.

You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?

You said they would be here!

If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them?

But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.

You sure?

Mars?  What are you doing?

All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.

What are you doing?!  Stop that!

Did he say if she was shooting at him?

Go, Chief.

Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --

Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.

You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call.

Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!

The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?

Try Al.  See if you can open Al.

No!  They're right here --

They're still in the house.

He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.

Yes.

How do I reach him?

I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!

I guess we do.

That's what I came to talk to you about.

Let me see your identity card.

Let me explain.

I don't have that much.

I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.

You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.

Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.

Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.

Well rewarded Those were his words.

I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.

Get in.

After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.

No.

I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?

I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.

Business is good at the hotel?

I am always glad to see you Paul.

Why not? We are half way there already.

We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.

Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.

Fuck you.

Give me the phone.

Gregoire, what are you doing here?

Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.

Yes, sir. What is wrong?

What?

One thousand francs.

No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.

The third floor are low class rooms.

We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.

Yes, with Fedens and the children.

Murdered! By whom?

What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.

No, Odette says he's in shock.

Please go back, bring the children to us.

What are you saying, Tatsi?

Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.

What for Paul.

So where is the lamb?

A kiss.

Yes.

What sort of car?

I want to know.

I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.

No! Sit down now.

Paul! Then another voice.

We are almost out of everything.

What's wrong?

Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.

Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.

He has taken the presidential suite.

Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.

When?

Where?

What is his room number?

You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.

-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --

-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --

-- the whole thing is falling apart!

Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...

-- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me.

C'mon.

A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.

Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?

Is she alright?

-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!

I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!

As a tumor.

I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.

It's not going to let us out!

Over here!

And we get this money when?

I'm better than that.

Why?

An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.

-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.

Back where?

Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.

Wait a minute... What are you saying?

That's crazy!

I don't do groups.

You've got your own TV show?

I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.

You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!

Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?

Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?

You're hurting me.

If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --

Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.

My wife. Where were we?

And then what happens?

What?

Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.

-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --

Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.

-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.

I can't comment until I get paid.

What's going on?

Why not?

Believe me, we need to.

The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.

Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.

He must've unsealed the room!

Melissa...?

So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.

Why don't you pass me your plate?

I didn't do anything, mommy.

Yes, we'll be leaving soon.

I'm ok mommy.

Where is she?

For good luck honey.

Well, that all depends.

Good night daddy.

Aubrey knows more about us than you think.

You didn't think much about that before.

You seem to appreciate the local scenery.

What's happening!

I'm ok.

Well that's what we're here for. I mean -

She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.

Yeah, they told us this was the best.

Why?

Aubrey?  It's mommy.

Good night.

Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us.

It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...

It was nailed to the cellar wall.

I know what I saw.

You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...

It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.

I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.

Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?

Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.

Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?

What else came with it?  Anything still here?

Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.

Wow.  Thank you.

What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.

Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...

Not quite.

Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?

No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.

I laughed, I cried.

It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.

Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."

Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.

Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this.

There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.

"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."

What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.

Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.

Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...

"But we'll be the same as we started...

Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.

No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.

I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.

Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...

Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....

Nice.  But right out of our brochure.

I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...

Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.

Prison?

Oh, I'm so sorry...

Somebody robbed the Vatican.

Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!

Oh.  Well, what's this?

You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.

If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.

Baseball, why?

Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.

Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!

Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.

What job?

How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."

Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?

For God's sake, chain this convict.

You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.

Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!

And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.

Employer?  The president?

I'm supposed to fall for that?

Why George, you big softie...

Tell me about it...

'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does...

Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --

Oh, no, really, I --

Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.

Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...

I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --

Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?

No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!

Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --

Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --

We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --

Norville!

Oh Norville, I --

Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --

Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!

Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!

Watch it, Archer --

I'm sure you do.

What the heck they doin'?

But, buddy --

Get up!

We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!

Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

You --

Wait a minute!

But, sir! --

Oh my God, sir!

Maybe he's wise.

He notices.

He don't look wise.

She is!

I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.

That's nonsense, Alma.

I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.

At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.

No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.

A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.

I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.

It's my day off.

Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.

Wait. I want to listen.

Did you hear what he sang?

Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.

Of course, Wes.

I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.

Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.

You can't really believe that.

No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.

Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---

She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.

What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --

I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right.  And I will have to urge him to use it.

Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.

Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.

I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.

No.  You're quite wrong.  Right here's the seat of the trouble. Mrs. Holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people.  It's revived all their old superstitions -- Zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.

Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.

Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.

Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.

No thank you. We should be off.

And as usual no one believed me...

I wasn't star--

Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.

Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.

You think I --

Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.

I know, I know. I had no idea --

I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --

Damn right, but where the hell were you?

Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.

Jesus all right enough!

What do you think we're doing, dad?

Huh?

C'mon.

And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --

Don't fret, Benjie, it's --

You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.

Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --

Nah, that wasn't in the contract.

Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?

Mom. Are you ok?

Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.

It's really quite all right.

It's not like we're too busy.

Yes.

Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.

Aha! I could sense the vibe.

Moisture! Moisture!

Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.

My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!

I'm not good at math. Just geometry.

Sure.  Twinkie?

Then why'd you come after me?

I dunno. I --

Maybe we can just watch some TV.

Yeah. Yours?

Greetings, Charles.

With who?

What time is it?

I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --

What are you doing at home on a Friday night?

Hey Sandy.

Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.

The ones you built?

Are you his girlfriend?

If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.

Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.

Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.

Too bad...

We already did.

The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.

I don't remember.

I know.

What I saw?

No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...

I told her to come.

Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.

Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...

Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...

Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.

Huh?

Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?

You don't know.

Best friend?

Who?

Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.

I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.

I didn't want to kill her, Will.

Are you the leader of tis group?

I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.

You said there were none.

We can do that?

That's what the one who made me said.

Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.

I can't save her.

I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.

What you are? You would be something other than you are?

It will grow back again!

The way I learn everything. By watching you.

I can't. Go away from me.

Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I did it for you -

Still my beautiful child.

Yes.

You are more beautiful than any of them.

You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --

Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?

Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.

How devilishly clever.

Be still!

No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.

That's not so.

What do you mean?

Then my luck would have changed.

But why do you want me?

Yes...

I want a woman.

Do you think so?

Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.

But how do you know?

What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!

You finish her - if you feel so much -

Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?

What are you saying?

Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.

I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!

You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...

We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.

Oh, that rumour about crosses?

Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...

Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...

What about a radio?

Who? Who is here?

Phones went down a few minutes ago.

Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.

No.

Up-tighteous and self-righteous.

What are you doing in my closet?

Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.

Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...

Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.

I will, and you remind me of the same thing.

The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.

Just kidding.

I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.

Come on, you can make it.

You're okay. Thank god.

This weekend?

Will you try...for me, please?

It's gonna be great.

I'm fine.

I'm fine.

Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.

Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.

We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.

They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?

I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.

Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.

I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.

Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!

Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.

Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.

Tell me this ain't the bar scene.

The rest of us see bathrobes.

Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.

How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?

How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.

Why don't you stay here tonight? Get a good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.

I think she went to bed  I saw her going toward the house

On my word! That's what they believe.

If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me

Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.

My last name is Pherides.

When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.

) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints  the way you can turn the truth into a lie --

That your father and I 

I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed  imprisoned..

Yes?

I don't understand you.

If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.

She's not too well.

Why -- no not before Thea came 

Maybe you've got the wrong crypt  after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.

But that should make you like her.

Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.

I can't.

He hates all my race.

It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.

For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --

Then foreclose!

Are you running a business or a charity ward?

Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?

Suicide.

Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.

You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.

No.

What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .

Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.

Zuzu's petals.

Sit down? What are . . .

That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.

George Bailey.

Not a soul.

That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star  made second team All American.

That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.

Hiya, George!

Looks like we'll have to send someone down  a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.

Mother . . .

That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.

Well, what happened to you?

Oh . . .

I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along.

I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?

No charge.

I'm working across on a cattle boat.

All in . . .

Well, she's not crazy about him.

No.

Oh, George!

No. No.

What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox.  Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here!

I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?

Have a good time, son.

Very funny. Very funny.

Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.

Oh, yeah, yeah.

She was here first.

Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.

Nothing.

I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.

Right down here.

Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.

Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.

Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .

I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.

Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?

All right, sir.

Have you notified the police?

Five hundred dollars.

Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?

Well, now listen. I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear? And George, I may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary . . . Mary . . .

Uh-huh.

Neither am I.

Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.

You may kiss my hand.

Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.

Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.

Mary . . .

I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!

Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.

Thanks for dropping around.

Lassos the stork! You mean you . . . What is it, a boy or a girl?

Left them at the office.

Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?

Sure, sure I am.

Hmm? Well, I . . .

You going to the lighthouse?

How fast is enough?

So's mine.

Swim for it!

Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you.

I was counting on hours.

No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.

Sean!  Catch it!

What the hell, we're steering for it.

Gangway, Turkies!

Want to swim home?

Oh, yeah.  Sure.

It's still there!

Hendricks.  I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.

You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.

Not the drugstore!

You can't stop me.

Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.

Never mind that shit.  Just point.

Every day?

You'll have to make up your own mind about that.

Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.

At least you're safe.  What about the others?

You said something about a camera.

What else you got?

All of us thank you, okay?

Too late, it's written.

Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.

Look, I know a little bit about sharks.

Sound?

Can't you tell?

And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.

Home it is.

Nothing, huh?

Terrific.

He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.

Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.

Mike's out there.

Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.

It's still a good idea.

Last transmission said ten juve- niles.

That's what he said.

No.  Find your brother, okay?

Hiya yourself.

Dad!  Dad!

Shh.  Shhh....

Ready?

That's a crock of shit.

Nope.

Double nope!

And second?

Wait a minute.  Promise me something.

Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....

Coming about....

If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!

Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....

When are we going out?  You and me?

Eat Cheerios.

Quiet!  Shhh!

So?  So?

I have to walk him till the drug wears off.

No, I'm fine, thanks.

Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.

I can get it.

Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.

And a missing man.

Coming with us?  Overman's buying.

They're acting very strange suddenly.

I guess.

See you later.

Honey, I gotta go.

I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.

I don't like what he does.

He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.

I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?

Look, Michael... you don't have to come.

... Electrical connection malfunctioning.

Michael, the sub's dead.

What's that?

Yes?

How's your patient?

What's up?

Sure.  Let's go.

No,  I'm not going through there.

I don't want to see them, Kathryn.

Well, that's why you got it.

I can't take water, Kathryn.

It's a shark's tooth!

It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.

Who's going to do it?

I want that shark, Kathryn.

Only to myself.

Fine.  Have them do some.

Make this quick!

Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.

Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.

Afraid I can't do that.

Still sleeping.

Should be coming out of it soon.

Thanks for helping.

You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.

Brian, he's coming around!

And big for his age.

Not good enough.

Sure.  No problem.

Someone's looking for you.

... Massachussettans aren't.

Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?

The one that goes underwater?

No, think of something else.

It's okay, Sean.

SEAN!

Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!

Now what?

Don't you dare.

Calvin said it was all right.

Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?

Yeah, poor bastard.

Hey, I don't want to hear.

So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?

That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.

It's not closing, Mike.

All right, hit those lights too.

... I'll go to McDonalds.

Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.

That's what grandmas are for.

Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.

Was Uncle Sean ever bad?  Did you ever spank him?

Yes, you can make sandwiches....

Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....

What's wrong?  What happened?

It went away....

You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....

Spent it all on beer....

Bang sticks are like yelling at it....

Mommy lets me....

I'm still five....

It's not nice to be evasive.

What?

Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....

He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....

Come on, I'll show you around.

I'm fine....

I am.

Good.

I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.

Why'd you come out here?

Promise me....

I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....

Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?

Boss' day off...Take the wheel....

Where do I pull off...?

Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....

Nothing....

You're always taking time off....

What?

Yes you can....

How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?

I do....

Just like that?

Yes I can....

It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....

Get her started....

Aye, aye, Captain....

I fly elephants for smugglers....

Still chasing fish?

She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....

I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....

The females have eggs....

You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....

I didn't do it on purpose....

Stop busting my hump....

Holy shit!

Don't say anything about this to my mother....

So did I....

Lots of times....

What?

You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.

I live to hear the sound...You all right?

Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....

Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'

If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....

Don't flatter yourself.... 

Here comes the cow ca-ca....

We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....

Yes.

No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-

I'm afraid it's the "van" again.

Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.

You heard. Look for the knife.

The <u>dogs</u>?

A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..

Seven thirty-five .. Here, "Town Gets Top Cop." I was gonna pin it to your wall.

How'd you do it, old man?

Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.

<u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?

Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.

So am I. But where's my money?

Pay me, and I shut up.

Then give me that Zippo.

For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?

I was wrong.

You don't really believe this?

I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..

This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.

Hey ..

Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?

Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?

Once.

That's bullshit,

I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?

Fucken noddle's hanging off ..

How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere ..

What are you looking for?

Bullshit.

Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.

I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..

I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.

Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.

No.

Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?

No.

Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"

How d'you know what I'm like?

Really? What did he say?

It's not possible right now.

Then why didn't he kill me?

I know about alcohol, John.

I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.

Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.

Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.

I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...

Even better.

She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.

I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.

I'm already walking. Where is it?

A derelict.

His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.

I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.

I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I meant something else.  When do you want to leave?

Jerry!  Do something --

No.

I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.

You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.

Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?

Hmm.  Pretty good.

Well, take care.

No no. I knew.

No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called "my twenties." See you later.

I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...

Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.

Absolutely.

Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --

I just got goosebumps.

And I am...

No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.

Good evening.

You don't have to explain.

Yeah, what happened there.

Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?

Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.

So this break... is a break-up.

Of course, medical! _ 42.

At eleven at night? _ 70.

No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.

Thank you.

It's only a half-hour show, Rod.

Ten seconds, Rod.

We decided to stay with you.

It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.

Yes.

Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.

I gotta get back to Cushman.

Oh my God.

Great word.  Towel?

No, I don't know.

No.

Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.

I missed ya.  What can I say?

I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.

A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.

How sad --

Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!

Not a chance.

The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.

Hi Ray.

And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.

Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...

Nothing.

Eric...

We have to help him.

That one time was just the bumper.

Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?

But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.

Just hold on.

Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.

It won't hold!

We'll be broke in four weeks.

No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!

Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...

I don't remember that on InGen's list.

We should take it with us to signal any planes.

NO!

Sorry, Alan it's been six years.

Raptors, mostly.

I try not to.

You think they could talk to each other?

In Costa Rica?

Which one do you prefer?

Any weapons, radios?

It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.

The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.

I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.

No. Although I've studied them in the wild.

I want to be an astronaut.

She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.

This plane can not land!

I have never been on this island!

Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?

Just a little bit too much, I think.

Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.

After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.

That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.

Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.

You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.

The velociraptors.

It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--

Oh, God.

Oh, my God.

No!  Get in the car before they hear us!

So the truth is more important to you than your life?

It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-

I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.

Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-

That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.

I'm trying!

No.

Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.

Where did the vehicles stop?

I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -

Shhhhh!

The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.

Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?

That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.

Oh my God.

Why?

They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.

Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!

Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....

We were right!

Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!

- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -

And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.

I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!

They're not here.

Why not?

No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!

No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!

Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!

He sends his apologies.

Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.

Because he's like me.  He's a digger.

Yeah.

And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.

Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!

No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.

Yes it is.

This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.

It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?

You want to talk about this?

Kids get scared.

I know.

There's gotta be something - -

I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -

Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -

Oh, I hate the other kind.

Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.

Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!

Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.

Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!

Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.

You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.

Wait a minute?  What do you mean "worked"?  Everything is still off!

I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.

Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!

They don't bother me.

They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.

That was great!

Fifty? We need seventy-five.

Who is this? What's going on?

I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.

Come on.

Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.

Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.

Who's chest?

Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?

Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.

One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.

That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?

Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...

Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.

Great.	When can you do it?

I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.

I don't know... but I think he's pissed.

Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.

If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.

Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?

What was the matter with it?

The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.

-- In what sense?

An empty tomb?

Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.

Another one?

No, I left it in his office.

I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.

I'll commit that to memory.

Yes.

Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.

Sit down, Kafka.

You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?

Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?

-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.

No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.

Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.

Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.

Tonight?

And you ...?

You won't have any trouble finding it.

They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.

He was murdered.

I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.

Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?

Usually.

I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.

No -- not this time.

Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?

-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.

-- Just doing our job.

-- Oh, yes, it's mad.

What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?

It usually is.

Yes.  Isn't it there?

He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department

Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?

Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.

We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.

My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.

Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.

Father ... Father!

You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!

How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!

Value? ... Value?

I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.

Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now.

Jack!...  Jack!

Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!

Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!

We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!

Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!

A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb

Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.

Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!

) They are now.

Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake

Yes?

I said yes, I see.

Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.

He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.

You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.

Could I ask some questions?

What about everything since?

Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --

Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.

OK.

You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.

What do you think?

It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.

And I don't think that was Tom.

No, I said what did you think.

Well --

It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.

Mm.

What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.

What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.

No.

We did this before.

I don't like getting splashed.

Yup.

What?

Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.

About what?

I believed her, Pete.

I better keep looking.

How is it back there?

Yeah.

Yeah, two things Pete, that --

It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.

No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.

Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.

Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.

Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.

Did she talk about him to you?

I think she's trying that.

Then how are you involved?

Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --

Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?

He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.

I don't know. It looks familiar to me.

I left them here. I was doing some work here.

No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --

He's in his room, playing.

Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly.  At the moment I am seeing no one.

Lunch in a restaurant.

Greatest...

Wow!  French toast, really?

Soon.  I told you before, very soon.

No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.

Can I be excused?  I'm not hungry.

In a minute...

C'mon, Billy.  I'm trying to work for God's sake...

I'm allergic to onions.

You're no bargain either, pal.

Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.

Oh...

It's okay, son...I'm here... Just a little more to go... Don't worry, son...I'm here...

Sure.

Sure.  Lots of times.

Yep.

Uh huh...

I guess about the same kind of things you do.

Why does he decide?

I don't understand, daddy.

Where will my toys be?

I do not, your honor, however--

Does the witness deny the injury took place?

Then I have concluded my questions.

Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.

Objection!

Objection!

What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.

Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.

Yes.

No.

Yes.

Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.

Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.

I don't know...

He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--

Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--

Yeah, well he did, didn't he.

I don't think so, Jim.  Maybe I shouldn't have--

You want to know the real kicker?  The real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--I feel like a loser.

I don't know, Jim...

Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.

Yes, what?

I don't believe you.

Murray.

But it's not a year from now, is it?

Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?

I don't know, John...I mean, to be brutally honest, I'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now.  Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.

The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.

I can't tell you how sorry I am.

Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.

Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.

Ted?  Are you there?

No, but--

Ten.

What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.

Got it.

I'm sure.

No.  I don't think so.

All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.

Ha!  You tell me.

Will you buy the sheep for me?

Here. We'll collect them.

The Sera monks have surrendered?

Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.

Yes, but they say he did.

Yes.

Then, we shall meet.

At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.

Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.

I accept it. What is suffering?

What do you think?

No. Not very big.

It is an island. American territory.

I do not know, Holiness.

Look here!

And, America?

I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.

Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.

The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.

A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.

The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.

We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?

Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.

Does he have the spot?

And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.

You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.

But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.

I would not know. Maybe.

The Chinese.

But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.

The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.

Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?

Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.

The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.

Too young?

Oh, yes.

<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!

I'll need any and all topographic studies.

I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.

A spring trap!

No crocodile has ever--

So profound and fat.

I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.

Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--

That's actually the easy part.

Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.

That hurt my feelings.

I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--

You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?

<u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--

They could try to tranq him on land.

We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.

Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...

So I don't like tents, why--

I'd be able to see something.

I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--

In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.

Good.  See ya soon.

What are you talking about?

Ssssh!

<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!

You calm down!

He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.

He's floating.  Take it home.

Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!

He heeds a tourniquet.

Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?

Good thinking.

So does he.

I'll take it!

You too.

And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?

I'm fine, thank you.

You talk to the married couple?

What kind of backup do we have?

They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.

You threw it at me!!

It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.

I'm sorry.

I asked you to be nice to him.

<u>That</u> was a bust.

He said he knew Karate!

I don't know.  Back the truck--

Wait.

I guess.

Me too.

You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...

Part of our research--

<u>Kelly</u>--

Kevin told me you were upset.

Liar?

Shitbutt?

Thanks, Ardelia.

The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...

He's here, Ardelia.

Well, except for the one girl.

I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.

Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!

Get me out!

I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy.

Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?

Starling -

Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.

Who's the subject?

I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.

To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -

You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.

He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.

He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?

Not lately. But maybe someday.

Sometimes you do.

"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.

I'm - still in training at the Academy.

Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?

No. I only hoped that your knowledge -

And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.

A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.

Then please - do this test for me.

What's that, Dr. Lecter?

Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.

Because you weren't wasting my time.

Big through the hips. Roomy.

What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.

Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?

After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?

The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.

No. We just -

All right, then tell me how -

Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...

Yes...! They were screaming.

Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.

It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.

You have my word. Paul?

Did you breast-feed her?

Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.

Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."

Why did they turn back?

I'm sorry.

Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.

Because what I am interested in is right here...

No. I will find you.

Yes. I want you to go.

Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!

Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?

Yes. Yes, I will.

I am sorry, Duncan...

We were headed...

No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.

Do not let gratitude get in the way...

That is sedition! Treason!

Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!

Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?

You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.

Tradin' your skins in Castleton?

Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...

The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.

...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...

That's all, sir.

Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!

I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.

And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."

Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready! 

Fire!!!

Yes sir!

I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.

"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."

Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."

How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?

But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?

Granted.

These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.

It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.

But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?

What?...

Were, Doss <u>were</u>.

Can you fix it?

No!

Just get in yours!

All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow--

What?

After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.

Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?

How much time does that give us?

Where's Jones?

Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...

...I'd really have to show it to you.

It bit me!

Okay.

Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.

The weather's good, I already checked, but I'll be off in a minute.

...and a Russian grandmother...

It...almost got you.

Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward!

He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."

What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...

He's tanking on us...

Twelve hours!

What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.

Under there?

Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?

"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...

I ought to smack your face!

The good doctor signed our death warrant.

How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.

Your pocket?

Probably no longer than four weeks.

I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.

A traffic warden. Look, what's this?

Well, talk.

I still will, if you don't mind.

They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?

I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.

Apart from those shotguns.

Like antiques.

If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.

There were two old guns there; where are they?

It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.

You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.

Fucking Northern monkeys.

Can I help?

Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.

Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.

I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.

About twenty minutes.

All right, Dad.

That's no way to answer the phone.

Sure is.

All right, Kenny.

It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.

That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.

Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.

I mean it, there is only three of us here.

What do you mean?

Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.

The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.

Right as rain.

For half a million?

And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold.  OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?

I wanted to talk to you about that.

I want your bar.

What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.

Well, perhaps you can help?

Doesn't sound very good to me.

At what, exactly?

Get your fingers out of my soup!

It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!

That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.

The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked.

What do you mean?

Oh, come on, Amado--

I can't take any more school.

They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.

We were just dancing--

I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.

You're testing me?

Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.

Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.

We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.

Yeah.

Colt Peacemaker.

Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.

You look awful good in that uniform, though.

I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.

The Trail of Tears.

So they stayed in Florida?

Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--

By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.

Dad, can I talk to you about track?

How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?

Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it

I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.

I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--

Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--

Seriously, I think we should get married.

You know who it was they dug up?

If the next guy's a redneck.

You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.

I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?

Appreciate it, sir.

Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.

Nice to meet you, Ma'am.

And people make their choice--

This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?

Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--

No te molestas. Tenemos a ella. [Don't worry. We've got her.]

We was crossin' the river--

Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]

He was a unique individual.

Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--

That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.

Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.

Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--

We have a murder?

I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.

I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.

Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.

I'm unmarried. I'm not available.

If you spent a little more time training them--

He was killed.

Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.

Okay? He's not here?

And that was the last time you saw him?

Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.

Of course you can.

Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.

Enough with the clothes--

You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.

I thought he busted you a couple times.

I'm surprised he bothered with it.

So I've heard--

They've got my Amado.

Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.

A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--

So she tells me three times a week.

Amado.

Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--

I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.

I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.

Couple months before I was born--

Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.

I appreciate you telling me.

You don't need to cuff me.

Sure.

You sell much out here?

Runnin' numbers illegal.

You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.

They go together.

doorway) And who's that?

I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?

Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.

Deep shit?

He's a priest?

What do you mean, "all of us?"

I could scoop them out.

It's him... it's him.

It was me.

Yes.

Did your husband know Quaid?

I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.

And you don't ask questions?

No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,

Harry.

Do you?

Sure.

You haven't seen anything yet.

Why?  Because he had you?

Yes.  You do that.

I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.

Swann said he could do stuff, yes.

He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.

It's okay.

You can't.

I'm here, Harry.

Good.  There.  Yes?

Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.

I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.

I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?

I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...

We've never met.

I don't think the dead much care.

I tried to pay you off.

Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?

We've got to get you to a hospital.

What about?

And what does Jennifer think's real?

What?

I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...

Yes...

I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.

For what?

Have you been in?

Why?  So you can fuck my wife?

Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.

I don't know what else to do.

You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.

At a guess... they just resurrected him.

There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.

What?

Fuck you.

You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?

So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.

Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.

No.

Hi, Charlie.

No way.

Ok.

I know. I don't either.

I see them every morning.

Yeah, you don't remember?

That's ok.

They really have to work on that street name thing.

Fuck off.

I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...

Yeah.

Yes, but no, I can't right now.

You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?

That's what you said the other night.

I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.

Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.

I'll miss you.

That sounds great  can you hold on...  What Zoe?

Bob?

Is this a bad time?

I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?

Hello, Bob, it's me.

Hello, can I have room 5601.

What?

What?

Bye.

Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to...

I don't know.

Sure.

Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.

We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.

It's Susan's cooking, Claire.  That's why Uncle James lets them stay.

Says she can get me in to see this killer.

I can't believe Will killed him.

I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.

I don't know.  What are they?

Must be a spare set.

He will.  He has great faith.

You ready?

Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.

Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.

You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?

I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.

...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...

You need his blood-type.  Like right away.

Not pure evil.  That's correct.

Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.

Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?

It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.

There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...

And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?

Townsend, he had some of Father's books.

Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.

I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.

Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.

What are these?

Terrific.

Not a lot.

I know who he is.

I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?

Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?

Get out of here.

I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.

Thanks for having me, Sally.

As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.

Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.

Of course.

I'll quit, maybe you should start.

Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.

Where is she now?

Nothing.

You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?

What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?

You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.

Are you okay?

What'd you do?

It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.

This time get your feet set.

You're cold?

Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.

Four days.

To do what you love.

No.

Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.

Mom tell you to do this?

Damn, Lena...  Who is he?

Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.

Too many times.

Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?

You lost your head.

What?

I'll take that as a compliment.

She hates all freshmen.

I wouldn't know.

It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.

What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?

One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.

I'd just tell my sister, Lena.

Kay.

Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.

God, here we go.

I'm warning you, don't tempt me.

Yeah.

Hey.

Yeah.

What?

My court, I go first.

Right here.

I wanted you to.

Why not?

What's up?

It happens, right...

Hey, what's up.

What the hell's going on?

Are you out of your mind?

Talk to your new girlfriend.

Cheap date.

Look, I'm entering the draft.

I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?

Few days ago.

What do you mean?

Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.

Something was just missing.

Find.

Better late than never, right?

I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.

So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.

I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.

What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."

Keep your voice down.

Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.

"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.

Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.

Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.

You know, people.

Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.

What?

I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.

I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.

You want me to fuck off?

Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.

ooohhhhhh no.

No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --

It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?

I'm really only equipped to take orders --

Does this sound weird?

There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.

It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?

It's a helluva disease.

It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.

I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --

I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --

It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please?

I'm sorry, I had to get dressed.

-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?

Was it a boyfriend of yours?

You just move in here?

I'm a bit of a slob myself.

Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.

It's not -- what's a 422?

It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.

Okey-doke.

What's that stand for?

Good bye.

Really?

Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.

Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --

I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.

Can I tell you something?

That was so great what you just said.

You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.

You don't know how crazy I am.

What?

Diet Coke.

NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.

Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --

Put the gun down, please, boy.

I think it's more complicated than that little man.

Why the hell aren't you in school?

They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?

No Can Do.

I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.

I'm a rapper.

I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.

I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.

Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.

Don't Donnie. Don't do it.

Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.

You were gonna ask me weren't you?

Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --

You do?

Where is he?

Go fuck myself?

I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --

Who?

I'm looking for Frank Mackey.

You got us a room so quick?

Like I said, yeah --

This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --

Mm. Hm.

Go ahead and waste your time.

What am I doing?

I'm quietly judging you.

My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.

She's retired.

What name?  My name?

no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?

About three weeks ago.

I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --

Oh yeah.

Uh. huh.

Mmm.

Quietly, slow down, whoa --

The door was open, I got a call --

I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --

Then you've got nothin' to worry about.

Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.

OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?

What's this, how did this happen?

I didn't hear anything.

Did your wife find out?

All your other fluzzies?

Fuck no.

Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.

Are you alright?

I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!

I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --

I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --

It'll take the pain away.

I'll answer anything.

How long with Paula?

What about now?

Well maybe.

I don't know what I've done.

I don't know what I've done.

Hello.  Is Claudia here?

Are you her boyfriend?

You're her boyfriend?

Like what?

If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?

Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --

You need to sober up.

Linda --

Shut the fuck up.

What are you doing?

PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.

....it's alright....

-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --

Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.

Maybe.

I'm sick of being the one, the one who always has to do everything, I don't want to be the one always --

I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school.

See you.

I didn't know the answer --

I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --

It's not right.

It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.

I understand you saved my son's life today.

If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.

May I speak with you?  Alone?

Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.

No, Louis!  No!

Replace the king.

Making the key to the throne.

Come, we have a boat waiting.

Tomorrow.

Those can be adopted --

But -- what is Porthos doing?

Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.

The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?

Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.

It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!

So what has changed?

Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.

We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.

The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.

I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.

Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?

Forgiveness?

Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.

Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?

I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.

Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.

What use am I?

Who?

We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.

I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.

You are right.  But it is a trap.

Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.

We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.

I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.

You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?

Save my son, d'Artagnan.

Get out of my way.

To kill the king.

The King killed my son!

Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...

What is its antidote?

How did you --

If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.

Who came?

Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!

It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.

Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.

It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --

I must insist, Sire.

Thank you, Keeper.

Yes, yes, go on.

No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.

Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.

Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.

How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?

You would do that, your Majesty?

Sire, I --

No, you may wait behind the screen.

Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --

Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.

Where are you?

You set to go -

Did you report it stolen?

Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--

Don't worry -

But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?

Fine...

Fine -

When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...

Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.

Gotta come from somewhere...

Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.

That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?

And who are you?

I didn't break in - the back door was open!

Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?

Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.

Who is it?

You'll find out - soon enough.

I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.

Yeah...they did.  One girl...

No -

Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?

Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!

I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!

I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.

I knew I could count on you.

I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.

Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.

Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...

Not with this...

Then what did you do, play canasta?

I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.

He doesn't think you run mind games on him.

Could he handle a direct contact?

How are Molly and the boy?

Christ!

It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.

Twenty minutes max.

Library of Congress.

Will Graham, Jack Crawford...

Read it.

I have to.

I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.

The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...

You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...

Why?

Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?

You.

What is it?

We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.

It's your call, Will. What do we do?

Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.

I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.

That's narrow?

Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...

He had to.

Don't talk to me!!

What?

Wait for the back-up! Will?

They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...

Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.

Uh-huh.

I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...

I'm fine, Francis.

You'll come by?

Me.

No.

Yes.

I don't know...

Yes...

Oh, God.

Yes.

You'll let me go now?

No.

I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.

I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.

Thank you very much.

Atlanta and Birmingham.

Most people are.

Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.

I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.

Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?

Huh?  Will? Is that you?

Tell me about yourself.

Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.

No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.

I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.

Go on to the house...

Yes.

With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.

Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.

No.

Huh?

You read about it, I'm sure.

There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?

I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.

Yes.

Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.

When you do have one I'd like to hear it.

I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.

Yes.

You got it.

Tank you veddy much.

The stewardess let me keep my headphones.

George, I hate sitcoms.

I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.

He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.

Hi George!

You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.

You've got good days and bad days.

Yeah...

Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.

Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...

You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!

No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!

But it's only for thirty seconds!

These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...

Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

I'm here, ain't I?

Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???

If you want...

No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!

It's me.

DON'T TOUCH ME!

You're a wimp.

No!  Andy, don't do it --

What is this, World War Two...?

No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!

I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.

And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"

Yes, your Holiness?

The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.

Are you sure?

Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.

I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.

Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!

Look... I don't know what your problem is...

Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!

Where?

No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.

What?

Oh, God.

All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.

I know but I felt like taking a shift.

Hear what?

Yeah, 'course I'm sure.

Don't tell me you're a believer now?

That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.

No!

How many were there?

Shit!  Apoc?

What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?

I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.

How do you know all this?

Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.

More important than what is when?

You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.

You -- you're too fast.

I think I do.

Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.

What do you believe in?

Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.

Morpheus, I don't know --

Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!

She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.

Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!

Do it!

He is the One.  He is the One!

I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.

How did you know...?

I'm not the One.

How do you know that name?

Who are you?

It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.

It's going into replication.

No.

Yes.

Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.

It might have been.  I'm not sure.

Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?

There has to be something that we can do.

What choice?

I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.

Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.

If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.

Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?

Guns.  Lots of guns.

Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.

Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...

Look fella...this is private...

Let go of her.

You sure?

Can't we come with you?

'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'

Anybody wanna have a game?

'Thou art then a king?'

I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!

Jewish...

She don't look Jewish.

It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.

So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.

Panther!  Same thing...

Not quite...but keep trying.

Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.

Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?

Did you see them run!

What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!

No you're not...

For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...

Get him in.

Yeah, thanks, it's ok.

Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.

Fine.

Fine.

That's nice.

No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.

Oh...around...why?

You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.

Wha?

Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.

Ok, we'll go for lunch.

It's all right.

An apartment uptown?  Downtown?

What is it now?

No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.

Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.

Which one, the big tab or the little tab?

Sal!... fourteen street.

This is some boat.  Your father's?

I know...I know.

He's coming.

Love that name.

Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.

Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?

A name?

Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.

'Goddam party'!

But what?

Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.

Okay, give me a bottle of wine.

Good, good.  Glad to hear it.

What 'business'?

Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.

No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.

Yeah.  Goodnight.

Am I not obligated to?

Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?

Of whom?

Then why did you bring it up?

But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.

Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.

Did you just hear something?

Me, too.

What?!

I am now.

If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.

Certainly.  Goodnight.

Certainly, Bill.

You get not to go to jail.

Well, that's very interesting.

Yeah.  Neat.

How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?

Make it go 'way.

Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.

Rass!

Good morning, Jennifer.

What?

Yes?

You're welcome.

What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?

Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.

I haven't.

I'm sorry.  Do you live here?

I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.

I don't have any.

Patients have visitors, not doctors.

It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.

And I appreciate you, too.

I am, too.

I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.

To bed.

But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --

I love you now, I'll love you always --

I won't.

It is a deal?

Yes?

Make an exception?

That's what everybody says.

Why didn't you stop me?

Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?

'Fish'?

Then I can't help you.

I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.

May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.

What are you saying, that it's time to go?

I think you heard me, Bill.

Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.

Get him in here.

I'll take it from here --  I am --

What?

I'm sorry, I --

What the hell is this?  Who are you?

It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.

In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.

'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.

Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --

Yes, Bill.  The question.

Thank you, Quince.

But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.

Does Drew tell you everything?

You're not listening --

Bravo.

You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.

I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.

A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.

Yer damn right.

Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.

Then what will you say?

Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?

Where's he going?

I'm having a helluva time.

No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.

That's why it's okay.

I agree --

You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?

Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!

From what?

I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.

That must suck. All... backwards.				 *

This isn't my room?

Then why is this my handwriting?

When was I in here?

Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.

Yeah, I remember you.

Strip!

So you have information for me?

Yes.

But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.

Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.

That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!

I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.

Who did he go to meet?

Where is he?

He'll kill you, Lenny.

Yeah?

He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!

Somebody's come. Already.

Calls himself Dodd.

Don't protect him.

You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.

Thanks.

Don't just waltz in here dressed like			  * that and order a beer.						  *

So why did you come here?

It's good.

Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?

Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?

No. No, just let me think for a minute.

How'd ya get him in here in the first place?

Fucking hope not.

I'll ride with him. You follow.

Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.

She's involved with these drug dealers.

He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.				  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			  * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again. He's been pretending to help you.		    * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		    * being some local drug dealer.					*

Wouldn't be appropriate.						*

No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?

Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *

Sammy didn't have a wife.

Why would I have a gun?

Lemon or lime?

Doing...?

Grieve elsewhere.

"And" what?

He any good?

There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...

Recruit us to do what?

...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...

And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.

You do.

Right now.

Okay.

Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."

And what is that?

Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.

Later!  Do you dance?

No.

"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.

Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.

'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?

Really?

A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.

Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.

No.

Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.

I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.

I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know.  That part of what I do, you never want to find out about.  Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go.  Not me...

"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?

He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.

Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...

'Cause she will tell you.

What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.

You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?

Nothing.

It's in the suburbs outside Havana.

Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?

Too fast.  Too many moving parts.

Then you should.

What's your Miami PD badge number?

Okay.  What's up?

Hi, Gina.  This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?

How will it stand up?

Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?

He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...

Yeah.

...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...

A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.

Define small.

Nicholas said you okay.  That's nice.  But how I know if you any good?

I had to lay eyes on you.

Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...

You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...

Hers'n zodda meg a livig.

Men, they mostly faggots.

Well, ain't no use hanging around here.

Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!

Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.

Talking helps. Don't talk, you get muddled in your head. Hey! Now you just look at this here!

You gonna beat me, Joe?

For money for what?

Now take it. Go on.  Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...

Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.

Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?

Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.

Rico. Rico Rizzo.

And what?

What of?

Who?

No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.

Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? That's agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all these new people my name's Rico?

I'm wet.

Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.

Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.

Uh, yessir.

Is he all right!

Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.

Where?

Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.

And what do you do when you in the catacombs?

Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...

Oh Jesus! 

Ah, look!  they probably know where the campers are

I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...

...She was on the plane.

I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.

Hello.

Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.

Billy!  Please!

Section 13?

What?  You gotta be joking.

I want to cut his throat.

You know where it is?

Yeah? Where?

What?

Oh shit.

And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.

Cat, ah!  Ayip!

Who got the Frenchman out?

Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?

Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...

Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"

Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?

Immigration's gonna love you for that.

New York's finest.

...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...

No, you talkin' at me.

You got a better way up?

Oh, man, there you go again.

Just do it!

Oh, Jesus!!

Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...

Depends.  You got a memo?

What?

Manny...

We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.

I'll be late.

Susan, we're not b-

You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...

They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!

What is it?

Fuck! It broke the skin...

What?

Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.

I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.

Anything you can tell me might help.

I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.

I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.

The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.

Will I be able to walk?

Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--

If you wouldn't mind.

You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.

She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...

Yeah, thanks.

Well, I hope you like it.

Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--

I DIDN'T...

Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.

You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.

You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.

Annie, what's the matter?

You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.

--cliff-hangers--

They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.

Yeah, yeah...

Have to wait.

My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.

Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.

To Misery.

I think you're right.

The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.

Why would I want to leave? I like it here.

Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?

I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.

I'm glad you like it.

You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.

He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.

What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?

It's good you found it.

Maybe you can, Libby.

No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?

Buster.

If I can.

We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.

Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.

Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.

No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.

I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.

Not possible..

Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.

Sean, please..

Hugh, I'm impressed..

Oh, I am.  Later..

I suppose I did.

'Thief in the Night?'

Not as much as you feel like hearing it.

Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.

And you're happy about that?

You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.

In other words, you're calling her a flake.

Ninety-three point four million.

..or hard wired..

I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.

What are you talking about?

What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?

There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?

I hope there's a place to land.

No.  Should I?

Oh, either way works for me.

- torque wrench.

Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.

Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.

You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..

And six billion in the world.

Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.

Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.

How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.

Just like old times.

- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.

No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!

No.  You just looked as if you did.

'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'

Twice.

- is where Miss Hall comes in.

We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.

You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.

Yes.

Well, Hunt, what are your plans?

Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.

I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.

No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>

Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.

She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.

You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.

I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.

So what do you suggest?

And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.

Good idea.

Walk, just walk.  Start walking.

If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.

I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...

I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.

I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.

Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.

I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.

You didn't have to.........

What about you?

We did what we had to do.

Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...

Theyíre dead.

Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!

One hour.

Yeah.

This whole operation was a molehunt.

Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.

Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.

Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?

I'll get you close.

You really liked Phelps, didn't you?

The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.

Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.

Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.

Bank?

What's the matter, you don't know this trick?

Roger that.  Opening doors now.

Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.

You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.

Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.

I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.

Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.

A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.

Youíre probably right.

Keep counting Claire.

Of course I can hear you.

I don't know.

Jack you're so wicked.

Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.

Twenty minutes.

This wasnít what we discussed.

Very good.

Why you drinking so much?

Thank you, Rose.

And go to confession.

No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?

I didn't give you away the first time.

It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.

Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.

What'd you do to your hair?

They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess.

I don't know. I got a feeling.

Good morning, Lucy.

Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.

Excuse me.

Loretta.

He knew my husband who died.

Why what?

So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?

Stupid.

No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.

What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?

I am looking where I should to become a bride!

A wolf without a foot!

Get all of me. Take everything.

I've never seen a moon like that.

You're trying to make me feel guilty.

You ruined my life.

I can't!

Alright. Meet me at the Met.

Hi.

Yeah.

Yeah. It smells like snow.

I know what I know.

That's right.

Why?

I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.

No.

What?

A week. Two weeks. No more.

I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.

Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.

No.

I got married before, you didn't sell.

Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?

Cosmo's cheating on me.

Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.

You gotta date?

That's a pretty big sin.

It's late.

That's incredible.

Don't shit where you eat.

Sure.

I'm too old for you.

Oh.

Is who down there?

You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.

Did you dress her up like this?

It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!

Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.

Please!

I am your king!

You don't vote for kings.

NI!

NI!   NI!

You said it again!

What?

No, it isn't.

Come on you pansy!

What!  Just a flesh wound. 

This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.

Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...

|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!

That's it.  Ni!  Ni!

It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |  At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION.  ARTHUR turns. | |                              ARTHUR |      Who was that? | |                              HECTOR |           |      It was Sir Alf. | |                              ARTHUR |      I didn't know we had a Sir Alf. | |                              HECTOR |      He was feeding it bread. | |                              ARTHUR |           |      Well, that was a very silly thing to do.

Oh, just some friends!

There are some who call me Tim?

I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.

There.

I didn't know you were called Dennis.

Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of

Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?

If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.

Do me a favour.

Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.

My name is Sir Launcelot.

Blue.

Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.

Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...

Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...

Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.

Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.

Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -

What?

The Prince ... ?

We're coming with you.

Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.

Camelot ...

We'll cover your escape!

No, I'm not.

We must examine you.

Please ... we are doctors.

I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...

Don't say that word.

Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...

So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.

That's pretty good for a ghillie.

It's better than shovelling horse shit.

They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?

I've got my duties to attend to.

You watch your tongue.

It's a diary.

What do you take me for?

Mary Taylor, sir.

Kitchen and lower house.

I see.

She's busy.

Are you deaf as well as stupid?

It's so infernally cold in here.

My own.

That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood.

How will I know?

I need a man who knows where I am.

Aye, do.

You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.

Is that the Queen's request?

I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.

A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.

Occasionally.

The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.

The greasy pole.

No love.

In time, she will.

I'm glad of it.

I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.

Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.

I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.

I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.

Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.

Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.

Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.

The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?

Excellent!

No, she wasn't.

Cold is good!

I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....

I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.

I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?

Mr Brown is unable to attend today.

A few days, ma'am.

Again?

I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.

What is it?

Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?

Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.

Sure.

How do you do that?

How'd you know it was us?

Did you play ARCADE last night?

Hey, kid.

How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.

You imagined it.

It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.

She thought Benz was at school.

My house.  I want to try something.

...but then it hits the relay stations...

Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...

I don't know.

And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!

What?

We're actually inside, aren't we?

There...

Check your read-out.

Not yet, honey...

Can you say anything but "cool"?

What did you say?

I know.  Where are you Adam?

Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.

You gotta be kidding?

Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.

Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.

Okay, I'm thinking.

One.

Okay.

You're an understandin' fella.

That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.

Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.

Right. See ya.

I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.

Yes.

Very pleased to meet you.

Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?

I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.

But you won't.

Yes, there was.

Diane?

I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.

She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.

But, this could be serious.

If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.

I don't know who I am.

Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.

Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.

Not that I can see.

Maybe it's not me.

"I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."

"I can call them... I can call my dad... "

"Before what?"

"Then they'd put you in jail."

What is it? What do you see?!

Do you know them?!

Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.

Oh boy.

Two men... two guns in the Caddy.

Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit.

I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....

It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.

It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.

Knows ? He watches every "Guest" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.

I'm leaving.

Why would he ? His parents are rich.

Not listening !

Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.

But how do you know if the people are guilty ?

Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?

I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years.

Know what ? That it was your fault ?

Okay.

You don't. It's random, there no trick.

Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?

Hey , Hey !

Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?

Not quite....

A dragon.

Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations. We're heading a little higher up now.

Ow...

I said NO.

Got it.

I just want to double check the facts.

I am thirty two.

I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.

John, sir.

Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.

We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?

Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours.

<<belch>>

The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead.

Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.

I think I'll see hat action.

He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.

Thank you.

Sure.

Yahoo !!!!!

I just need to sit and think for a second.

Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.

I'm fine.

We made it !

I want to go to sleep for about a month.

Where are we ?

UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.

What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?

What about giving the other guy a break.

Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.

Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....

No it's okay, I understand, really.

What boy likes you?

Of course.

Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....

It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?

Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.

Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.

If I eat it I'll throw up.

Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.

Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?

Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?

I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.

Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.

Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.

oh.

Come on in!

No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.

That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.

I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.

It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.

The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.

I never met my mother.

TAXI!!!

Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.

Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.

I love the fragrance of chilidogs.

Change my name.

Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.

And I thought I was weird.

ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.

Don't force it, you'll break it.

I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.

Give it to me!

Leave me alone!!

Jerk! You IDIOT!!!

Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.

But we wouldn't really be related right?

No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.

He's an undertaker.

Like what?

Nick?

Some sacrifices are worth it.

Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.

Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.

Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?

They're great.

Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.

Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.

This is it I guess.

Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.

Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.

Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.

There's plenty of fruit.

Not exactly.

She'll be all right baby.

Bye Niece, Vada.

Nothing, nothing at all.

Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.

Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.

Oh, sure okay.

Is there milk in them already?

You're telling me.

But what about you and the baby? You need me.

I know, look at his little hands.

He is?

Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.

Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.

All right, here.

Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.

My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.

Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?

Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.

Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.

Pardon?

That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.

What do you mean??

She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.

Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.

It's no big deal.

No. Just, more activity.

Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.

I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.

Okay, sure.

It's nice.

Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.

What happened to her?

Yes.

It's only eight o'clock.

Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?

Really?

Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....

Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.

O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.

Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!

They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.

Ahh, maybe next summer.

Can I go too?

Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.

Yes.

I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?

There were just too many of 'em.

Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.

The last date I had was twenty years ago.

Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.

Will you tell her I came by?

It's summer! You're kids! Go play!

Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.

Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.

Why do you think she says that?

Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.

I am.

Well you don't know that. Ask him.

My ball, I lost my ball.

Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?

They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.

Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.

Hi.

This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.

Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.

Uh huh.

It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.

You could pick that scab on your arm.

Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.

Yes.

Don't DO that!!

What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.

I am not.

I stopped that!

Really?

No, I'm hiding out.

I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.

Umm, Ummmmm

Well, let's spit on it.

Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.

I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.

The wandering sportswriter.

Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...

He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...

He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"

I have a suggestion...

Chill?  Since when do you say ch...

You've been working on this, huh?

Major.  Dish.

Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.

Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.

Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.

He said that, too.

It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.

Let me rephrase that...

... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...

I love him.

I think you're making a mistake, sir.

He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.

What's next?

Quite the little eccentric.

That would be a girl.  I don't even know.

Boy, those were the days.

You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.

You keep saying that.

Well, you've got the rest of your lives.

No.  I've got you.

Have you.

It's more than that.

I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.

Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.

... maybe it's congratulations.

"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."

This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.

The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.

That's little egotistical.

... and public relations is a big problem area for him.

Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!

What is that sup...

MICHAEL!!

I see.

Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?

I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.

Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.

Green.

Thank you-- Yes, I am.

You get her those Vitamin E right away.

She's going to rest now.

His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?

A little slow, but she'll be fine.

Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.

Whose?

Sue was trying to get hold of you.

Where the hell have you been?

It's the den mother.

What crook?

Harvard?

What is a turkey shoot.

A little. What do you need?

Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.

I'1l get your bag.

Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.

What did you say?

Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.

Bet the sheets are grey.

Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.

Yes, it is --

I'm here.

Who is this?  It's Tom.

Well...

What?

You sound different. Is that really you?

Money's no object.

For him?

Sleeping.

Do they have a show to give it to you?

Where are you from?

You bet.

You think I got any kind of a voice?

I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.

That's what Tim said.

Yes, you are.

What...

We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --

How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.

Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.

Thank you, sir.

Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.

By all means.

Ain't love grand.

There's a chocolate cream filled in there?

Good...yuppie piece of shit.

She sings? What does she sing?

I'm keen with anticipation.

Let's do it.

What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.

Do you miss Mallory?

Then was it worth it?

Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?

Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?

That's indescribable.

Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.

No.

Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...

And a snake-eye glare.

They've hypnotized the nation.

That's the way of the world.

That's my opinion.

I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.

Rockin'!

You should see the other bitch. What time you got?

Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.

They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?

Would the network really not run it without the interview?

Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!

How so?

Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---

I can't do that. Five guys.

And me.

Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?

Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.

Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.

Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.

They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.

That dyin's gonna be done two ways.

Well, what d'you know?!

I'll smile when it's funny.

You' new here, man!  See you, boys.

Where was your father born?

That ain't my idea of friendliness.

Oh yeah?

Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?

What d'you expect?

Well, I don't get on so well most places.

Don't Duff--

I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.

Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.

'Been up north?

Just for the day?

Are you married?

No. Women're always followin' me 'round.

I thought you wasn't comin'.

You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?

Well, what d'you think?

Yeah?

Come here, baby.

We'll be all right.

What're you going to do?

Watch out!

I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.

Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.

'Round town.

How 'bout the key?

'Got a good thing, man.

Wouldn't have known you.

Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.

Great.

That's right.

She don't look no worse to me.

Sure.

That's right.

Who is?!

How are you?

I doubt it.

I guess not.

Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!

Oh yeah?

Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.

Hell, I didn't know you was married.

If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.

You hate Raoul?

Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!

I'm still on my honeymoon.

I'm fine.

I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?

No. I only needed the code from you.

The Elders, mon...

Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.

Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.

They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.

How's the villa's security?

You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.

You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.

First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.

Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.

This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.

He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?

Can you read my mind?

Are you even really alive?

The words?

Yeah.

Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.

Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.

All things possible in Babylon.

Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.

Jah guides us.

Right...

What?

Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.

When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.

Less than thirty minutes.

Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.

Why would you want me to kill you?

What's my end?

Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.

Couple of months.

We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.

What the fuck... are you serious?

You're not ready yet. They said two days.

Put the gun down, Case.

Something exotic I hope.

What went down between you and Riviera?

Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?

...And if I guess wrong?

Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.

Hold on.

Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.

I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.

Well, do you?

Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.

Thanks.

This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--

Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.

Well I'm so glad that you guys are.

Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.

What about the "Roaring Twenties" or "The 80's"?

You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."

And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?

Jos, that's not what we're --

Very romantic.

We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"

Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.

Why?

Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?

And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!

Oh. Right.

Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.

He's my teacher!

Yes. I'll go. Yes.

Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?

Someday this luau is going to be all mine!

Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!

I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.

Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.

Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?

Is that true?

Better than I...

With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.

And a gymnast!

Really?

I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.

I don't have to say that.

I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.

To put us back together again when we fall.

Oh--yikes!

Wow. You believe in me that much--

It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?

Yeah, I have.

You were attracted to me?

I just can't look at you the same way.

What?

You so do not deserve to be prom queen.

Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!

Thank you.  I'm Rob.

Yeah. Definitely.

For this.

Good.  I'm hungry.

No.

Can't you make other creations?

He stayed a long time.

Specifically.

It's getting there.

Oh, come on Dad...

What are you talking about?

I wasn't sure, Ken...

Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?

I'm Jesse now, Lisa.

I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!

What about it?

Yeah, why?

Shut up, Grady.

You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.

Yeah.

Wow...

Something Grady told me today about the people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street...

World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?

I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!

I don't know - into the air I suppose.

I'll get over it.

Whoa!

Oh, Jesse...

I'm not hungry.

I killed him!  I killed him!

he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.

I can't!

Hi.

We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.

Huh?

I know it's warm...  I wish you'd call someone to check out the air conditioning, Ken.

Okay...thanks.

Thanks, Mom.

It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.

I had such an awful dream.

Can't it wait till morning?

Wait and see.

I gotta stay up, Max.

Just tonight, please?  I can't handle the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not after Phillip.

No fuckin' way.  We're a team.

But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.

He's heavy in the halls...

It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?

Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.

Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.

I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.

Nancy...

Never been here before?

I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?

Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.

Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?

I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.

Try me.

I can do that.

Remember -- open mind.

I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.

Neil, please --

How do we get in?

What are you talking about?

A sad choice.

Mary Helena.

Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.

That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --

I won't allow it.

Yeah?  What did we ever do?

Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."

And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.

Now you're lying.

Here, let me help.

No thanks.

You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.

Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.

Hi.

Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.

Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...

It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.

That's fine.

You said 'whoopsidaisies.'

There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.

She saw through me.

There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.

This is the place.

Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?

Would you like me to take you through your lines?

Hand it over.  Basic plot?

'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?

Damn.  'And Wainwright...'

My son's name is Johnny?

I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.

Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.

You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.

How do you think I'm doing?

Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.

Hello.

Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.

Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.

You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?

... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.

Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.

And what would you say...

Who is it?

Nice surprise.

What's your name?

Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.

Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.

Right. 

Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.

It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.

Is Miss Scott staying here?

Well, yes.  Groovy.

William has just turned down Anna Scott.

Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?

And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.

This is Henry James film?

Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.

Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?

Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?

That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.

Definitely no comment.

No -- did you?

Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.

That's not fair.

But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.

And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...

No, no.  She doesn't.

Hi...

Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...

Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.

No -- you're right.

Why not?

I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.

Right -- let's talk about rent...

So?

I haven't got a book down my trousers.

Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.

No, Miss Ratched...

Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...

Would you like to start?

I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.

I was in luh-love with her.

You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!

No! No! No!

Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.

Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...

What for?

You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!

Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.

Right!

No way.

Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!

A vote is before the group.

But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.

I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.

Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!

Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!

Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.

Yes, Miss Ratched...

B-B-Billy.

What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.

Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?

W-W-Where we g-g-going?

Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...

C-C-C-C-Candy!

Thank you.

Ca-na-da...

What for?

That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?

Atta boy, Cheswick!

Yeah, Mack?

Let me get on your shoulders.

Huh?

So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.

Does that mean we have to cut him loose?

My feet hurt...

Your buddy is callin' ya.

I'm seeing what a busy man does.

I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!

She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.

Now, what would I be trying to say?

I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?

A nickel.

No! I wanna go!

Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you watch me.

No.

I see.

Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?

It is worth considering... Miss Ratched?

No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.

Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!

'Kay, Mac!

You're on!

Shhh!  This way!

'Kay...

Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.

I don't have any.

Oh...

Thank you, ma'am,

No way...

Yes, Miss Ratched!

Why, sure, ma'am...

Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...

Are they dangerous when they're awake?

That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.

You ol' fucker!

You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.

Why?

Your hair... is perfect.

It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.

Oh no.  Do you?

No...

Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?

What's mezzaluna?

Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--

Hm.

Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.

You said whatever it was you would understand.

I'm in love with you.

If it's any of your business, yes.

Yes.

Does he love you?

Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?

Because I don't have the right name?!

Who says I don't love him?...

Where's Positano?

Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.

Hi.

You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.

Well, good.  Good for you.

What?

Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.

I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?

Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.

The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.

Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.

Hi.  Are you... busy?

I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.

I can't believe you did that!

A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?

Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?

That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?

Just since yesterday.

Well, not exactly...

Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.

Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?

Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...

Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.

Oh, hello.

No.  He smokes.

Just moved in with his girlfriend.

He's a podiatrist or something.

Yes you did.

Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.

Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.

I know.  You're right.

Larry brought me flowers last night.

What about your job?

You don't have a passport.

Does Dwayne know about this?

Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 

How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--

What?

What is it?

The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.

I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.

Sure you did.

Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--

And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.

I meant about my idea.

A little bad luck?

What?

He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.

Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?

No one's perfect, Kate.

You don't have to go if you don't want to...

No, why?

Right.

No.

Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?

He missed me.

She didn't give me a chance.

Good strategy.

You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.

And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?

What do you weigh these days, slugger?

I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.

Okay I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.

I wish I knew, Edie, But 

You hear that, Terry?  Terry, did you hear that?  You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.

Do you like pigeons?

Good. So do I.

I started them Golden Warriors. I was their first Supreme Commander.

Oh she's a beauty.

Even pigeons aren't peaceful.

How about another one?

Naw, in the ring, a dive is-

Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.

Listen get this straight don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .

I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not I'm just all mixed up... .

Why should I come hollering to you at all?

I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt What more do you want?

There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.

It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.

I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.

Get away from me.

Well, it's over.

Are you sure they're your friends?

You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland the Middle West somewhere a job on a farm... .

You always said I was a bum. Well  not anymore. I'm going down to the dock. Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm just going to get my rights.  Joey's jacket. It's time I start wearing it.

Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.

He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .

Let me by.

Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you   Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.

Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.

Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but

Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies I'm on borried time.

We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.

I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.

Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .

Yeah us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?

No.

First things first.

Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 

Not a dent.  Perfect

You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.

Now just a minute, I

Listen, Johnny

You want to know somethin'?

Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!

What do you mean?

Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!

Nolan, me lad, ye're dreamin' again.

Keep Charley out of this.

Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.

Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.

Where?

I should hope not.  I hate you!

Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.

It would seem so, Master.

It would seem so, Master

Ahh, she will be yours.

At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.

Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?

Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>

Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?

Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.

Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?

Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?

Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.

You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.

Till they got busted.

His assistant.

Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.

Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.

Why you want to do that, to a frien'?

He ain't the problem, Jack.

Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?

We'll leave first thing in the morning.

We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.

Her phone's probably tapped.

I'm a tourist.

I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.

Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.

I saw Karen Sisco.

You know how I felt about her.

It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.

Yeah, I did.

They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.

I'll go with you.

Daniel Burdon, FBI.

Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?

You have to know what you're talking about.

There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...

Detroit, you must be pretty busy.

Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.

Wait, I know him --okay?

Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.

It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?

Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?

Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.

That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.

I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.

Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.

Sure.

Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.

Faye Dunaway.

Peter Finch.

Nothing.

Shit...

I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.

And your gun.

How do we do that?

Because you're having too much fun.

He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.

I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.

It smelled.

No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?

It's not a game.  Something you play.

It would be worth the risk.

You believe that?

I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...

Where?

Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me.

I'm just going to the bathroom.

Why are you mad?

I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.

What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.

You just did, for Christ sake.

I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.

That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?

Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?

Really?  Well, I uhhh...

Of course not.

No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.

The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.

How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.

How are you, Richard?

I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.

Yeah.  That was the ninth.

Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.

He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.

Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?

Can I do what?

I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.

No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.

Great.  We got one of 'em.

I <i>was</i>...

Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?

He said he stayed here last November.

Your dog was killed?

The State Theater?

You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.

I'd like that.

The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.

Off a tip?

He's pretty laid back, confident.

My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.

He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?

He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.

That's right, just me.

No.  Course not.

Yeah, as soon as we got back.

Well, I need that...

Still...

Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.

Ten gees.

I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.

No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.

Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.

He was that good?

You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.

But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?

Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!

If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.

I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.

Well, you p-puked on his feet.

They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...

I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.

Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.

You left her.  How's that for a fact?

Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.

Home of the brave.

I'm out of fuel!

Bullshit.  We've played with each other, pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?

Hang on.

How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?

We can explain, Colonel.

I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.

Yes'm.

Nice to meet you, Betty.

No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.

The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.

We're all going away.

Do one thing for me, before you go.

There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --

I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.

Have the planes made it to China?

And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.

Crank her!

The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.

I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?

That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.

You're probably the only one who could carry it off.

It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.

Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?

Why do guys do such stupid things?

That's disgusting!

You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.

Charlie...

I know. Put Scott through college.

Pretty strange.

Maybe I blocked it out.

Good.

You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.

What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?

Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.

What am I going to do with you?

I have to talk to you..

I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.

You know I never could stand your sarcasm.

Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.

You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?

If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?

Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.

It opens, too. Look inside.

Charlie? Was I dead?

Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.

Touchy, touchy!

Okay.

What, why?

But I'm remembering the future.

He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author  fat, violent, drunk...

Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.

They care about you. They're just a different generation.

Is that one of your poems?

I'd love to.

Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?

I think I'm way ahead of them.

It's not Charlie. It's me.

Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?

Doing some shopping?

Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.

Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.

Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.

This is not giving blood. This is drunk.

Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.

Why don't you go lie down for a while.

It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?

Sure, Mom.  Hello.

I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.

Way to go, Mom!

Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?

I'm just happy to see you.

Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.

Rosalie Testa!

You have an incredible memory.

I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.

Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.

You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.

I don't know.

Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.

We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...

I couldn't help it  I loved him.

You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.

Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.

Did you break up with Charlie?

Wait! I'll go with you!

The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?

I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?

--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?

I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...

He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...

Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.

What did?

Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?

Maybe it takes a while...

I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...

All the time.

I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.

Bob...

Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.

Yeah. Thanks, guys.

I said, don't worry about it.

One hour!

Close the law book.

I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.

Honesty is always best.

Sounds delightful.

Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results...

Defined by Webster's as harmless.

Funny.

I have AIDS.

Little baby girl.

Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?

Continue.

We?

Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?

What?

We're friends of Beckett's.

Not bad.

Correct.

Charles. Okay. Miller?

What kind of person is that?

It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.

No. I didn't.

Yes. On my torso.

It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.  Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?

Not unnecessary ones.

Yes.

I guess it was 1984, 85.

No.

That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.

Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!

Absolutely.

Are you on one of those conference calls? I hate when you put me on hold.

Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.

Thank you. No more questions.

Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...

Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?

Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...

I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.

But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...

What kind of people?

Second.

Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.

Take it as a compliment. Geesh.

Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.

Duh...

Probably since she was born.

Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?

How did you do that?

By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?

Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?

Helloooo...

Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.

... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...

He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.

Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?

Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?

We can't make it.

Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.

Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.

No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....

But they...they could still be....

I would try for them.

I know what's in here!

Tell me it's not a mirage.

Probably right.

Shut up.

Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.

60 years ago.

We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --

He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.

That's what I said.

He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.

<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.

Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.

Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....

Quiet, please. Everyone.

Riddick?

And what about the cells?

Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.

The child heard you before any of us could even....

Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.

Not staying in here another....

Well, you got the big gauge.

Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?

Not if I'm the one.

Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.

Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.

What do you care?

So much for my cocktail hour.

Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?

We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.

That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.

Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.

No.

Remembers what?

Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?

No, they won't -

That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.

No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.

Yo!

That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.

Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.

Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?

long pause) You know it.

What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.

Don't bother

So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --

In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.

Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --

I think you're making a mistake.

By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.

Stop right there. Bring me that paper.

Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.

Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?

I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.

He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.

Maybe not.

You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.

Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?

We can't.

God bless you.

But there's the doll, sir.

Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.

I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.

Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?

What?

Barnes comes from Hell.

Where's Elias come from?

I got one...

Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.

Hey take it easy man. They're scared.

No!

...don't feel like it either.

What are the heads?

I gotta didi man. Don't wanna miss that chopper. I'll send you a postcard. After I get me some. I'll send you some tapes too man. This new guy Jimi Hendrix man, whew... you okay Taylor? Just 'member take it easy now, don't think too much, don't be a fool, no such thing as a coward cause it don't mean nuthin. Jes keep on keepin' on. Okay my man...

Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.

Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...

Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.

This is one time we could sure use Elias.

My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.

Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?

I really don't know.



I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.

I'm sure you have.

Maybe you're going to have to like me.

How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?

No, please.

You don't sound as if you liked him very much.

As I said before...

I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.

Do you think I don't?

Much too late.

That's all there is.

I'd rather wait until it does matter.

I know.  Killaine has a warrant.

That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?

This must have cost a fortune.

You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.

Including Killaine.

I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.

That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?

He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.

Do you think I was faking?

I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.

Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.

They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?

You were there when I last saw him.

I don't want to talk.

Very ridiculous.

I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.

What will they do to you?

I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.

Goodbye, Betty.

We know everything.

$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.

You mentioned information.

Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.

In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.

I've got good ears.

You're not English.

How's life treating you?

Yes, I've seen it before.

Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.

Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?

You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?

Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.

They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.

Floater?

I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.

Would you?

Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.

Talk English.  How do I know you're you?

So it seems Sergeant.

Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there.

Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.

Maybe we've been pretty dumb--

I think so.

Pretty big chance, huh?

A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.

I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?

Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.

Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.

That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?

You didn't play it for laughs last night.

I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--

She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.

I hear she's a very pretty girl.

I don't know, sir.

Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.

We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.

What are my orders, sir?

Who's the girl?

Why should I mind?

As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.

That's not very kind.

Years, why?

You already have the checks, darling.

How about your new friend?

It's kind of you to see me.

He was delightful.

Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--

To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.

Yes.

I will, thanks.

Yes.

Sit on that log, dear.

Penfield.  James Penfield.

She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.

Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions.  I can't talk about it.

Exactly that.

It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.

No thanks.  I'd like to break away--

Yes, please.

And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.

I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.

Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.

I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.

I think she liked me.

I haven't really thought about it.

We were just chortling over that. Blasé and epicene.  It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today.

The Argies.

It's shit.

Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.

Mmm...

You're so gross.

Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?

I'm off.  Let's meet.  You promised to tell me about Norfolk.

Yes, finally.

Are you up to something?

Fuck off.

Take a look at these.

Dad.

Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her.  Tell her you made it.  She'll like that.

That's good.

No, thanks Dad.

Darling Susan.

In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.

You'd look naked without one.

It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.

Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.

Where?

I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.

News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.

Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--

You gotta earn trust.

My man!

You do it... you first!

And let my policy expire?  Sorry.

I say when it's over!

I'm not FBI anymore.

I asked them to give me a couple minutes...

I take the skin off chicken.

Fine.

A little mushy.

Take your hand off my shoulder right now.

Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?

Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--

So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.

Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?

Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.

Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.

Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.

Got it...

Right here, partner.

Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?

Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.

This Zen master surfer.

Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.

Angelo, it's eleven thirty.

Nothing.

Kid, get outta the way!!

We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.

I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.

Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?

Betadyne doesn't hurt.

Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.

Tyler, put the gun down.

Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.

Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.

Who's our back-up on this?

Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.

Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.

No more games.

What, Sergeant?

Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.

There's something else, Major...

Hawkins?

He knows our defenses.

No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?

Twenty-five percent.

Please, we hardly know each other.

I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.

You what?

What?

Who indeed...

To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.

I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.

How are you, Mr. Kross.

You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.

Yes.

Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.

If you can figure it out, be my guest.

If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.

Edward.  My name is Edward.

Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.

Just a romantic, that's you.

I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...

What are assets?

There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.

I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?

Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?

No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.

Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?

Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.

I have work to do.

I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.

I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.

Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.

Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.

I'll guard them and you with my life.

Huh?

Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?

I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.

It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?

It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.

Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.

It was good.

I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.

Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.

Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --

My what?

Thank you.

Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.

Vivian's in sales.

Goodbye, Bill.

I'm up.

Why?

Let him answer.

Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.

I bet.  That was our rent!

Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.

Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --

Where do you fit?

What?

You're a guest here?

And who is that?

Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?

It's very expensive.

It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.

Then I'm here till I die?

"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.

And what am I?

Of course you will.

This is true love. You think this happens every day?

Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?

I believe you -- So what happens now?

It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.

Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.

I thought I was going faster.

I'm waiting!

-- where?

His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --

I don't be-leeve this.

-- murdered by pirates is good --

It won't be easy, Sire.

I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.

DEATH FIRST!!

I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.

Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --

Who won? How did it end?

And our assets?

In that case --

-- power too -- promise me that --

Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.

Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated

Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.

If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.

That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.

You are ready, then?

I ought to be after twenty years.

I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.

For the Princess?

Good. Then pour the wine.

Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.

It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.

Don't say another word, Valerie.

Nobody's hearing nothing!

It would take a miracle. Bye!

That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.

"I want to croon,

How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...

I have hurt your feelings.

Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.

Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...

You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.

Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.

You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.

Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.

Exactly.  And how long did it run?

Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!

You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?

I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.

They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.

Coney Island??

I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.

Right.

I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.

You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!

You found a flop!

Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.

They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."

Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.

I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long.

Liebkind, no!

He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 

That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 

Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.

You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?

No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.

You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.

I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.

And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.

Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.

Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light.

I mean in show business.

What do you do best?

Send for Goebbels.

I told them we invaded England.

I'm not the police.

Of which morning?

Or arrived with her.

She didn't call anyone? Even locally?

If she paid you well?

Can I trade in my car and take another?

It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?

I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...

And the police haven't been able to...

Just what he told your detective.

I want to know if my sister is here.

Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...

You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.

It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?

No.

Are we just going to go on sitting here?

Yes.

Why can't I go out there with you?

All right! Then call! At least, call!

Neither will I.

She always tries to be proper.

I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...

You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!

What makes you sound so certain?

Bates never denied Mary was here.

When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.

I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.

I have to go, Sam.

No.

You make respectability sound... disrespectful.

I'm thinking of it.

I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.

I thought I'd gotten off the main...

The bathroom.

Thank you, Mr. Bates.

Thank you. Again.

Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.

You'd know, of course.

What are you running away from?

No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.

Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.

I mean... ill.  She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when.  Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating.  Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left.

A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 

I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.

Crane.

Then I'm free to go...?

Please... I'd like to go...

I'm sorry.

Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...

He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...

No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...

Maybe you saw Mary!

Shut up!

Leave me alone!

Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...

Did she talk?

[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?

I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.

Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.

You--a friend to me?

I don't know--I can't tell--

Papers--they all want me to sign papers.

That sounds to me very remarkable.

Why didn't you notify the police?

That's it. You get it quick.

Do you have many patients, doctor?

Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.

The wound is bleeding!

Yes!

A voice ...

Yes!

No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.

It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue! 

I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.

I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.

I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.

No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.

Yeah, but they leave you plenty.

Delighted, I'm sure. 

She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.

What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.

I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.

They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.

Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?

That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.

No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.

Well, I won't work on it from that angle.

Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.

Now don't that call for an extra!

We'll grant that.

That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.

Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!

Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.

There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.

It's all yours.

Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.

No use. He's a crab, I tell you.

Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?

Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?

All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.

I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.

I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.

You're insane.

One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.

To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.

That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.

What universe are you in, Paul?

A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --

Wait.  I want to tell you something.

So I can move on.  You too.

Well, some fiend might.

I don't want to know...

They're dumb things. I got tired of them.

Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.

Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!

Well, yeah.

No. Why should Rose be in my room?

I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.

Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?

You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.

Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.

This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.

What did you say, Brother?

She's watching the car again?

What are they doing?

What are they doing, Doll?

Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.

Then why does she act so dumb?

Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.

Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.

Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.

Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?

Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.

A wonderful woman, boy.

Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.

No, son, she is dead.

Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?

Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.

And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.

Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.

Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.

That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.

You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.

No reason at all, darlin'.

Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.

And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!

Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.

Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.

They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.

Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!

Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?

I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.

Who?

No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...

Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Hillyer... I just... couldn't help myself. I'm sorry...

No, sir.

Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.

Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!

I will see you at suppertime, Rose.

Yes, sir.

Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!

Yes, sir.

Tennessee?

Well. What kinda job is it?

Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.

All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?

Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.

Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.

Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?

She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.

Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.

Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.

It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.

No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.

Illusions, Madam?

Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.

Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.

More history, Rose.

Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?

No, ma'am, I'm just fine.

Doll, you and Waski run on, too.

Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.

Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!

Be quiet, Rose.

Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!

I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.

I was offered that job as a waitress.

What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?

You're not gonna see him again.

Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.

Fair enough.

I don't know.  Fuck off!

I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.

I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.

Yeah.

You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name?

Same day as before.  I think.

We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.

Bullshit.

Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers

Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.

Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.

Can't you say something nice once?

Where have you been?

What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.

Well, sir...

You're about an inch away from insubordination!

Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.

Murderer?  Really?

It's our job.

You are such a disappointment, Benny.

Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."

You know... you could say thank you.

First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...

All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.

Let's hope.

Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...

Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?

A.D. is a C.P.A.

Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.

See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.

Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out soon enough.

Billy!  Billy!

Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.

All right. Stand by.

Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.

We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.

You cannot escape your destiny.

But I have no sister.

I can't see.

Where am I?

Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.

Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.

Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.

Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.

How are we doing?

Yeah, she's comin' up.

Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.

Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.

It'll work. It'll work.

No, wait! I thought you were blind!

Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.

Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.

The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.

Red Leader standing by.

Your Royal Highness.

He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.

I see them. Wait, Leia!

Just...images, really. Feelings.

I am See-Threepio, human-cy...

Certainly not!

I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?

Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?

On my mother's grave.

And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.

I've got something to say.

Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.

It's just a..a party Janet.

Weiss.

It's alright Janet.

It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.

No, don't do that.

Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.

I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.

Now I

Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.

Sha la la la That ain't no crime.

No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.

The delivery boy.

And our World will do the Time Warp again.

...Fine.

To you, to me it's Thursday.

Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.

...I've never been in a man's apartment before.

I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.

What?

Do me another favor?

Could ya take off that hat.

Don't say that.

Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.

You's the novelty, Champ!

Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!

Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?

People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.

You're hurtin', man!

One more round.

...Thanks.

Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.

...It's very American.

...Still don't feel no heat.

He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.

...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.

No dollar.

How 'bout some Cokes?

Charge it.

Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.

What's happenin' here?

Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!

Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.

Bob.

You have my food in ya hand.

I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.

No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.

Rocky.

Hey --

C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.

I said, how ya feelin'?

Yeah.

I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?

...What?

Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.

Spider Rice.

Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.

Rocky, d'ya know what I done?

I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.

Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.

...I'm doin' it for a friend.

Fine... That guy's great.

My sister's a friggin' loser.

Let's get outta this stink.

Maybe ya should see a doctor.

Maybe another job is the best thing.

Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.

Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.

...Tight.

...No.

Keep this job, ya eat better.

Sure I like her.

Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.

...People talk to me more.

Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?

A tweeting bird?

I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.

No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?

Thanks for the vote of confidence.

Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.

Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.

Maroon, right?

Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?

So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?

Ask her...

The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.

It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.

Toon cops worked me over.

No...

No, no, no... I love my husband.

Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.

Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?

As soon as is humanly possible.

Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.

No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.

No, I don't.

Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.

Divorce?  Never!

Aah!

I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.

Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.

Yeah, that's better.

Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.

And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!

A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.

Me.

A Toon?  Noooo.

No, it's not.

I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.

That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.

I guess I am at that.  Cigar?

The what?

Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?

Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him

Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!

What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!

Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.

Romeo, I drink to thee.

Madam, I am here. What is your will?

I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!

Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.

Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.

Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.

Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,

Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!

As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.

Do you really think so?

When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.

So where do you go from here?

Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.

Now there's the Deirdre I know.

I thought I did.

Not yet...

I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...

I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.

I didn't say I was.

Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?

Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.

Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.

He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker.

I take it you still want the money...

In here...

Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.

Enough!

You'll die if you leave here.

I don't have it with me...

I sent it to myself in Paris.

It's done.

Much to your disappointment, no doubt.

I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!

There is one other thing...

Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.

No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control.  Alright, let's do it.

Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?

My way is better.

What a surprise...

Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?

I don't think so.

I know cops -- and you're no cop.

No thanks.

That's what I thought.

I asked if we could give him anything else.

Jujitsu.

One's a lot more painful than the other.

Like Larry or Swede.

So is the woman.

I wonder if she truly left the IRA.

I wanted to see who you were.

Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.

You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.

Know what?

No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.

My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.

Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.

Yes.

If Tony says this is it, then it's it.

Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.

Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.

Because I owe you.  Look at that...

So I do it.

If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?

Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.

What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.

Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.

What of it?

I might know where you could get a copy.

Dwayne listen to me -

The horniest dog in Nevada.

Seven thousand...

Cash and what?

Never heard of it.

I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.

Why?  Are you kidding me?

It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?

At the expense of six people.

Maybe.  Who cares?

What's that?

You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...

That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.

We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.

Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...

All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!

Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...

I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --

I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!

Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!

We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!

I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.

He found us, he shot her...he killed her...

It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about

What's your offer, Jesse?

Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!

Shut up, Jesse.

OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!

No.  Why?

It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.

I'm in here.

You deserve it is the occasion.

Booth.  Don't.  It's nothing. It's not worth it.  Remember what happened the last time?

Well, I can't let you down now, can I?

Great...

I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.

I love you Sally.

I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.

Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...

What did he buy?

Could it have been this?

A week ago, at most.

That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?

Excellent. I'll go down with you.

Why would someone do that?

Hmmm...

Sure.

I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look.

All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?

Sort of.

Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.

Well I'm here now.

What?

Just trying to be civil Dwayne.

Dwayne put the gun down --

Right behind you.

I was on a roll!  Im a little overextended now.

So I want the money and I want it now.

You're never getting that much.

Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.

And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.

Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.

I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!

What do you think?  Heart attack?

Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.

I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.

I don't think so.

It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.

In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.

Lee, you okay?

Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.

Those girls drove off because of you.

Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.

No.

Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!

You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.

Try to land on your feet.

This won't take long.

Who died?

Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!

How the hell did Tan get away with it?

You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...

IT IS CRAZY!

Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.

He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.

Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...

She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.

It's your turn!

We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.

She never even looked at you.

What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.

For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.

I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.

There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.

Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?

It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.

Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.

That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.

No.  I'm going to find out.

Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!

It's worth it to me.

This money is evidence.

No.  But I'll help you.

Baby Duck?

I still have my lunch money from third grade.

It's my responsibility.

Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.

I know, Master, but...

Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --

Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!

Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.

You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!

No.

A little.

I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.

Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.

What?

Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!

Don't go there...

Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?

Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself.  And he dropped this.

Stooly.

Stool pigeon.

Took off. Yes. They took off.

Yes, I think so.

Yee-aww.

It's him.

This concrete?  This is still America.

Oh yes.

Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.

You know him?

Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.

Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.

They put you in charge?

OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.

That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!

Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.

You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.

Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.

Carter, shut up!

You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!

Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.

Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.

Carter, can I have a moment?

Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got em.

Maintain eye contact.

Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.

Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.

But I'll get my normal fee, right?

This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?

Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!

And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.

No, I'm not.

Are you a reporter?

Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.

Betty Trout.  Five dollars.

-- The luau for Maggie.

Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.

You have one?

We'll see.

Without oxygen...

But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.

You can turn that finger around.

Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.

Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.

Six-fifty.

Cindy the manicurist.

Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.

Of course.

It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.

No.  You take it.

No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.

Can you fix it?

Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.

I kissed him back.

Me?

Well, you do have the dress.

I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?

She's the boss.

Why?

Quick.  Very quick.

Thank you, Dad.

Yeah.

So you're angry.  Big deal.

No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.

-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --

I hope he doesn't get out his slides.

Happy New Year.

Go for a walk in Central Park --

What?

At the top of the Empire State Building --

What?

That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.

I know.

I always wondered about that too.

Turn on your radio!

The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.

You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.

I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?

That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.

Thank you.  I love you.

I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.

No, I'm not. 

We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.

Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--

I want my money.

Walter and I are engaged!

What?

What?

Mom!

Like... clockwork.

Hello.

Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.

What's she talking about?

I don't think I could really describe it.

How about rapacious and love- starved?

Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.

This is going to be tougher than I thought.

Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?

I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.

It's never happening again. Right?

Oh, you're changing your mind --

P.  Dad?

I forgot to mention.  Jed called --

So I can go.

Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?

They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."

You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.

Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.

Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?

Dad, you're not taking this seriously.

English muffin.  How do you do it?

Whose show was this on?

Go to sleep.

She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.

She's going to cook something for us?

I was thirsty.

If she knew, she'd never forgive me.  It would be hopeless for the two of you.

Victoria? She's okay.

Shut up.

I can't know what I said, but we're not going.

No.

It was all they had.

Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --

Well...

Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.

Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.

No thanks.

Whose side are you on anyway?

I say we gotta take action. Now.

The woman question?

So? What does he want to do about 'em?

You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.

Later. When I finish the ironing.

Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?

They are singing for me.

With Ramón it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.

It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?

I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.

I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.

What's more important than sanitation?

I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.

What has it got me, your union?

If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...

I'm a fool.

He was born fighting. And born hungry.

Over my dead body.

She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.

Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.

Be still ...

And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?

Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.

Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.

But honey ...

Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."

You mean Delaware?

I thought maybe you forgot...

You've got to help around the house!

Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!

You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?

Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.

I was talking to my wife.

Shhh.

Come on.  Ease off the girl.

Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 

Did you see his hair color?

You like that?

Why? The guys is ready to deal now.

Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.

I'll see you tonight.

I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.

Nothing.

Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.

I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live.

You don't like the tune, find another station.

You can still work.

Danny, it's not what you think.

It's Tom.

I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.

Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.

I know a guy.

I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?

I find myself in dire need of some cash.

A quarter of a million, Jimmy.

Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.

Palmdale

Yes, Jimmy.

It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?

You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?

Good for you Jimmy.

What does that mean?

No, I'm good.

I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.

Hey, I was just trying to ...

Please .. I don't know what you're ...

Yeah, dickhead.

Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.

God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.

Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.

Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.

Tell me what?

Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people.

When?

Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.

Whata you mean?  He told me -

Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.

Answer the fucking question!

Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.

Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.

Several possession charges, but nothing major.

You mean the menacing red car?

Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.

And you've got wiener breath.

It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.

There's no motels around here.

I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.

Just admit you're wrong.

That's not good in prison. It's just not good.

Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.

A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.

Fourty-four, twenty one dead.

The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.

Shit, that was no big deal.

Looks like a flaming asshole to me.

Nope, he ain't Wade.

Like hell, you did.

You didn't volunteer, Jackson.

Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.

They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.

Keep trying.

Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?

Pass.

Did he see any sign of them?

A machine gun.

Same place we are.

But, sir...

I changed my mind.

Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.

Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.

Simpson.

Hell of a mission.

They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.

Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.

Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.

About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.

Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.

Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.

Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...

There's to be a bright side, look for it.

Well, I, for one, like cheese.

Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.

Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.

We can't leave it here.

Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.

ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.

Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.

HERE THEY COME!

That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?

FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.

Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.

I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.

Struggling with a pair of Germans.

Yeah?

Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.

We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.

He's fast, Captain, I saw him.

What about you, Captain?

Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.

Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.

Oh yeah, let me give you another card.

Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!

I just washed this shirt, didn't I?

Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.

Come on, it's graduation.

I'm sorry.  It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt.

It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.

'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.

Oh yeah!

Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.

Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.

I just had a phone call.

You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.

We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.

Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?

And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.

Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.

Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.

I like him a lot.

Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.

Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care.  Give him this pen.

Swear to god, I need to know the truth.

I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.

No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.

You're right.

Hi.

Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.

If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?

Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.

Look at those eyes.

Yeah?

Yeah.  What a day.

Yeah.

Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.

Yeah, I have to help my father.

Pardon me?

Goodbye.

Yeah.

That's cool then.

Sixteen weeks is a long time.

Yeah?

I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.

I'll see you there.  Bye.

I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?

I'm doing alright.

Yeah.

Yes.  Are you shaking?

Your letter came yesterday.

It was wonderful.

I think that we should stop going out on dates.

No, I don't, I don't.

Oh shit.

I'm sorry.

I love you.  Please, I love you.

Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?

Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.

Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.

Go ahead, pick it up if you want.

So what's up?

How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.

Hey.

Yeah.

You know Diane Court?

A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.

I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.

How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?

Oskar, please -

A charade?  How could it be a charade?

It's up to you.

In Breslau.

You're kidding.

I pay you too much.

I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.

It's good business.

Look -

You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.

I asked for metal, you gave me glass.

Look it up.

Yeah, I can.

Of course I'm on it.

There's nothing in the stores.

Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.

I need a drink.

He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?

Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.

Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?

Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.

They should be.

The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.

Yes.

Are you losing money?

They arrived, can you believe it?

No, no, what, what is it?

Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them.

There will be generations because of what you did.

I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.

He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.

37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.

The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.

Where?

That's smart.

What? I can't hear you...

I'm losing you.

That's okay.

What if I said you?

I'm inquisitive.

No, it's me.

I live here.

I'll go. I don't mind. Really.

You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.

Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?

Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...

Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?

I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.

The forbidden subject.

Good question. You took the bait.

But nobody wants to see that. Itll never go. Theyll rewrite you. You dont want that.

I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.

Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?

Were hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.

And we didnt want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneys worth.

Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."

How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?

Not good.

..and as lonely as I am...

C'mon. Let's go.

He filmed his victims.

No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.

Just in case...

You're pretty when you're angry.

You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.

Watch your back.

I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...

Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.

Are you in danger now?

Where is your attacker?

Is Sid in therapy?

Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.

Please, I have the perfect excuse.

Gotta.

It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.

I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.

No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.

I'd really just like to be alone.

Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.

Her old boyfriend?

But...

Gale?

But she's standing right next to you.

It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.

I get scared really easy, okay.

Where you going?

Melinda McGraw?

Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.

Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .

Wait, wait. Don't hang up.

Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.

I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.

Closer than you think.

Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.

I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?

I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.

Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?

But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!

Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?

Absolutely.

No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.

Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.

Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.

Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.

That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.

The killer called her.

Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!

Help me Sid! The killer's got me!

You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.

Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.

Nevermind, what'd you two find?

But you know who she was.

It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.

Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?

I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.

What the hell are you doing?

Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.

Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?

Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.

It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.

I know! He killed Kincaid!

All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!

Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?

I'm hanging up right now.

I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?

Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.

Who the fuck is this?

I was just asking. Why are you always at me?

Oh yeah.

Yeah...

Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...

I just wanted to see her, that's all.

I'm sorry. Don't hate me.

You sleep in THAT?

What are you doing here?

Now that it's out of your system.

Oh it did?

Hey, hey, it's just me.

The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.

Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.

You have to move on, Sid.

It's okay. We need to talk.

Oh Sidney...

What?

I called my dad.

I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.

Fuck you.

Are you alone in the house?

What's that noise?

You're making popcorn?

Really? What?

What do you think I said?

Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.

I told you not to hang up on me.

I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.

His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?

No...

Turn off the light.

It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.

What?

Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?

No, not yet.

You never know when or where a story will break.

Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.

You're sure it was the Hilton?

We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.

Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.

Afraid not.

How is everything?

What were you doing out here?

Have you contacted the bureau?

She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?

Not my daughter... not my...

What's the delay?

Has his story changed?

He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.

I saw him leaving wearing it.

Right here.

Can you knock?

...out at the airport...

We had a run in the mass murder section.

The why'd the police let him go?

I can cry on cue.

Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.

Why are you doing this?

No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.

Yeah, yeah... are you okay?

Whatever. Just hurry.

If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?

You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.

Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.

Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.

What am I? The beer wench?

Give it to me.

Ease back, Mills.

Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.

Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.  Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.

I thought you might want to be filled in.

I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.

Who are you?  What are you doing out here?

You know that's not true.

I seem to remember knocking on your door.

What the fuck is going on?

Because I envy your normal life.  Envy is my sin.

What?

I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.

You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.

But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.

This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.

I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.

All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?

And, if it's a threat.

Punishing.

None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.

A switchblade.

Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.

He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.

Satisfy our curiosity?

A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.

No.

It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.

I don't.  Neither do you.

What the fuck is wrong with you?

Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.

You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.

It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.

Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.

No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.

One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.

I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr.

I will.

Don't do this... please...

I don't know why... why now?

What?

High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.

It surprises me.  It really does.

It's a hard place.

He mentioned it.

You should look into private schools.

Did the wife confess?

That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?

An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!

Why don't you finish the job?

This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.

No sir...pleasure.

I don't believe in surrenderin'...I still got my sabre, Reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither!

He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.

You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?

There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...

Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...

God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...

I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...

Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?

Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...

Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!

You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.

Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.

<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?

Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.

Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.

No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.

An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.

I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...

Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!

What's that?

He just couldn't wait...

Cut it out, will ya...

Look?

Nine...  Ten!

Never heard of him...

Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?

They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...

That's the breed...Course it might take time.

Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!

Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...

I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...

One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...

It isn't fair...

<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!

We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!

Oh, damnit!

In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.

We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.

What?

So do I, believe me.

Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.

Yeah... I have to go to town.

Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.

Hi, darling.

It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.

Does this dog here belong to you?

I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.

Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.

Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?

I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?

Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.

The title won't do.

Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.

Really?

Twenty pounds on delivery

Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.

No Juliet?!

See you in jail.

When I have fifty pounds.

Romeo

Ned is wrong for it.

Yes, I saw it.

Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.

A share of the profits.

What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?

Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.

The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?

Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.

Nobody knew!

I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor.  I am sorry, Will.

It is all locked safe in here

Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?

What? Who?

Do you think?

Mercutiogood name.

I thought your play was for Burbage.

"Not having that which, having, makes them short."

Lady Viola is pious, my lord.

No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .

But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.

You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!

Your Majesty

I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed

I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.

Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam?

I like her.

But the plague

I have to get back.

The same, alas.

If they find you here they will kill you.

It is strange to me, too.

Oh

Mr. Henslowe?

Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.

You cannot marry Wessex!

But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.

Orsinogood name

But why me?

Lady Viola isyoung in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.

Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.

My hat?

Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?

Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!

Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!

I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.

A man, my lord?

A theatre poet?

With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?

Discussion group, Alex, discussion.

I don't have time.

Why, thank you, David.

I don't hear this.

You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.

Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --

You think so?

I don't know.

I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.

We just wanted to speak to you.

It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.

Yeah, I was phoning your mother.

I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.

But there's no --

What does it look like?

That's because he is. Does that upset you?

What?

Yes.

I see.

What?

Yes.

I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?

Just serve.

Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.

-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.

A blue one, OK. And it's still there.

Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.

Did what?

Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?

I thought we all were.

I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.

No, I don't.

Then let's spend some money.

He's right. You'd feel much better about it.

It's the only way.

Alex.

As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.

We were just sorting things out.

Oh, shut up, Alex.

What?

Burglary?

Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?

Who said there were four?

Yes, absolutely.

Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?

You're sure of that.

Do you smoke?

No.

No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.

What?

And you need your sleep.

I'm not sure --

I'm boring?

What happened to that guy?

Yeah, here, I mean, where else?

Would you like to see the rest?

A priest who dies.

Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.

It's a breeze.

Did he sound upset?

It's an improvement.

I'm a doctor.

A certain weakness.

The first one was fine.

One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?

Yeah, baby, how's it going?

Look, would you argue with your doctor?

She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.

Yes, but... I thought...

Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --

That's okay too.

-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.

Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --

Listen, baby, don't leave, really.

That's very serious. Who's her doctor?

Gee, that's very serious...

You're very rude... if you don't come back --

Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...

Whatever you say.

Yes.

I don't know. Just a minute...

I mean it or I wouldn't say it.

Hello, George.

... what?...

Yeah.

You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.

Then what do you think?

I am not!

Yeah.

Well, yeah... you know.

Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?

I've got heads here, Norman.

Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.

Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.

Jill's really great, isn't she?

He's a very private person, actually.

Okay.

Yeah... I mean great.

... he tried to... uh... make it with me.

Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?

Hey, I don't tell.

What are you talking about?

You don't do that anymore, do you?

-- we can't now.

No you didn't.

Sammy's?

Why?

-- you've got to leave.

Lester's on his way.

What's that supposed to mean?

She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.

Wanda...

You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.

-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.

-- please, please forgive me...

-- why did you come in today?

I guess you haven't heard from her yet.

Where?

What's gonna happen?

Well, like what?

George, I don't --

Fine. How are you?

How?

I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.

Do you really mean that?

I'm around you and I like you, don't I?

Okay...  Night, baby.

What!

Okay, but how did it go at the bank?

About what?

Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.

Nothing, I'll call you, okay?

Commercials.

What is.

-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.

... honest. At least you're honest with me.

Did you?

I see.

Sure.

When?

Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.

Okay.

I don't know what to...

But...

Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.

Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.

Didn't they tell you?

Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.

Okay, thanks.

I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.

I'll call you back.

I'll call you back...

Okay.

You do?

Steve?

Really? How about starting with tonight?

They're Yorkies and they don't shed.

Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.

I don't know. Why don't you ask him?

Jackie, what're you doing?

I know, I'm sorry.

Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?

-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...

-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...

No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?

Sure.

I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.

My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.

Two weeks from tomorrow.

Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.

That's fine --

Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.

No.

Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.

Yes, Dad.

I am, Dad.  Dad?

Yes, Dad.

No.

I'm not supposed to.

Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.

Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?

Try to think what it was.

Is there something bad here?

Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?

Okay.

Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.

Yes?

Not right now, Daddy's asleep.

Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?

Danny, come here!

No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.

Why not?

Does Tony ever tell you to do things?

Do I have to?

Yes.

Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.

Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?

And, er... where are they now?

Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.

Grady... oh.

Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,

I'm a Wendy.

I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.

Pleased to meet you.

Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.  So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not to busy, are you?

Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.

Thank you for saying so.

Yeah.

Hmm, nice.

Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.

Yes.

Yes.

No, nothing at all.

Yes, I did.

I think he did it to himself.

How do you like it?

Oh Jack, what are you talking about?

Stop swinging the bat.

Put the bat down, Wendy.

Give me the bat.

Give me the bat.

Wendy...

Oh, well - come on in Jack.

They'll love it.

No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.

Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.

Just like a ghost ship, huh?

Fine.

Fine.

A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?

What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?

All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.

That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.

For getting a divorce?

What kind of noises?

Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.

Let the boy finish the game, Nan.

Yeah.

I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.

I don't get you.

I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.

Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.

What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?

Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.

Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.

Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.

Oh?

What about crack?  You a user?

LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED

LET THY SOUL BE HEALED

You know what we're saying!

Were you tempted?

'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.

What did who say?

You did what?

You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?

And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.

I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.

I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you.

But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?

What a shame!

Were you wicked?

I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.

You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.

I knew that.

I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?

Again!

What?

That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.

You re okay -- for a civilian.

I... I brought you something.

An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.

Excuse me?

Are you sure?

Experience!  Right?

Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.

Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?

What did He say?

What is your full name?  Your Christian name?

Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.

You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!

What? 

What's a concubine?

Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change

Can do.

Like to who?

I'm outta here.

A what?

And whom would you call?

From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 

Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."

Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!

I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.

A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?

But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?

And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.

Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?

Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.

Saving you.  Move!

You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.

Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.

At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.

Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.

Okay -- no limo.

Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.

Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..

I've been worried about you.

Me too.

What?

Oh-huh.

A hiding place.

Who are you guys?

We didn't tell you what?

It's a bluff, Vince.

Maybe pants.

No smart-ass remarks or nothing.

That's what I figured, too.

Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.

We're losing it.

All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.

She's our inspiration!

Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.

St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.

And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.

She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.

I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?

Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.

How did you hear this?

I hit him square.

You will stay at her side?

Does that look like an animal hanging?

Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.

They need guidance.

Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!

Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.

He drowned.  Anyone could see.

I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.

I shall, gladly.

And now Jonathan Masbath.

He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.

My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.

The Western Woods.

Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.

No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.

What happened?

Should we go back?

But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?

There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."

Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?

I doubt that's the end.

Small talk.

The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.

Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.

There is no such thing as magic.

Yes, he does.  May I try?

I insist that you have it.

They have done nothing of the sort.

There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.

What did you say?

And, what did he say?

Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?

Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?

What... ?

What did you say?

No one will believe your lies, whore.

Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.

You got any money?

I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.

Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?

He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?

Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.

How are you, Bill?

What you got that's good to eat?

I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.

He does make some funny noises.

Please Doyle, don't.

No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.

But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.

Don't tell me what to do.

Don't tell me what to do.

No sir.

You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.

Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.

Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.

Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.

It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.

Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.

A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.

Why? Hi, Karl.

I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.

I did live there in the state hospital.

Yeah.

Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.

Why did he do that, reckon.

That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.

All right then.

Pull on your works. Your privates.

Yes sir. You ort not know that language.

You ort not to pull on yourself that away.

I reckon.

That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.

I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.

Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?

Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?

He ain't ever okay to me.

No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?

Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.

Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.

You better go get your things.

Naw.

I never was no good with history.

He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.

That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.

Okay.

Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.

He wanted to go off and play, I reckon.  You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.

Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.

Not really to speak of.

I mean tomorrow or the next day.

Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.

That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?

That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?

In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?

Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.

No thank you.

Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.

Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.

We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.

I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.

Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.

I'd love to.

Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."

The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?

Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.

Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.

I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.

Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.

Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?

Fuck you, kid.

Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?

Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.

Anything for art, eh, Paul?

Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?

Eighteen and a half years.

Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.

You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?

Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.

I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.

For keeps.

I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.

Anything, Auggie. Just name it.

I almost got married once.

Ruby McNutt. My one true love.

She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.

I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.

Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.

Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.

Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.

What difference does it make?

I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.

And how much are these?

And these?

What can I do for you?

Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!

And his parents?

Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?

You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?

And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?

I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.

Not a one.

Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?

An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."

I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.

Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.

Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.

I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?

Tick-tock, tick-tock.

Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.

No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.

You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.

Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.

Well, maybe just one. To be polite.

I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?

Nice drawing. Did you do that?

Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.

What time is it?

I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 

Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.

I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.

What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.

Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.

You work too hard, you know that?

Come on, just a little hint.

The inspiration.

No way.

Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.

That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.

Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.

I suppose so. He never told me about it.

What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.

If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 

Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...

...<u>might</u> do the same.  I have to warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm not screwed together like I used to be.

Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...

Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.

Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.

All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?

So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?

Well, it seems to me...

At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.

Easy.  Slow is best.

Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.

Well, I don't do it for just anybody.

I lie to my parents every day. And every night.

It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.

There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.

Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.

You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...

And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.

So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?

Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.

Pretty darn clear.

Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?

Objection!

I'm sorry, was there a question in there?

He didn't want to lose any more.

That's how journalists.  Answer questions.

Carl Heine came.

Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.

Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.

Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.

Have a look.  At nothing.

Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.

You're wondering why I held it.

Yes, he was.

Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?

I think you like learning.

Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.

Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.

A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.

Possible.  But not darn likely.

Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.

As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.

Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.

If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.

But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.

Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.

As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.

Such as?

Get lost, will you?

Beat it, Buster.

I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.

It's entirely mutual.

A what?

Manhattans?  This time of night?

Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?

How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -

First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.

What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.

Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?

Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!

I thought you weren't talking to me.

- Type O.

But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -

Knock it off, will you?

No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -

Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.

Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.

With those legs?  Are you crazy?

What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.

I never did like the name Geraldine.

Now you've done it!

Tore off one of my chests.

Now you tore the other one.

It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.

And I'm not even pretty.

You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.

You - you -

That's right.

You can both go take a flying jump.

I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.

I am.

Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.

You think he's too old for me?

Security.

Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.

His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.

We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.

Like right after the ceremony.

So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.

But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.

There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.

Get me Room 414.

There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.

Terribly sorry.

I'm Sugar Cane.

If there's anything I can do for you -

We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.

Stay as long as you'd like.

That's ridiculous.

Isn't that ridiculous?

Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.

Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.

We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?

She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.

Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.

It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.

Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.

And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.

Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -

Me too.  Bye now.

I'm not surprised.

Most of the time I slap it.

Why?

Pleased to meet you.

Just the two of you?  What about the crew?

Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -

What a heel!  I spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled, I buy me a new negligee, I bake him a great big pizza pie...  - and where were you?

Why?

I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -

We'll take it!

That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!

I'll say.

Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?

So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.

Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -

Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.

Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.

Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?

- Inauguration balls -

What theory?

I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.

Oh, I didn't hear you come in.

They repealed Prohibition?

Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.

Oh, Josephine - just imagine - me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio, on a millionaire's yacht.  If my mother could only see me now -

It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.

It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.

Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.

Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.

It's all right for a bachelor.

They shrink when they're marinated.

Bon voyage.

Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.

Oh, no!

You poor, poor boy.

Is it that hopeless?

Lets throw another log on the fire.

From a rich millionaire.

Me?

Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.

I told you - I'm not very bright.

I know.  Every time!

Me?  I was at Rigoletto.

Spats Colombo.

Well, we all got to go sometime.

What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?

You don't owe me no nothing.

No, Spats - no, no, no -  NO!

Theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?

So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.

Hey.

Actually, I do.

Why, with you.

Im not as square as my daughter thinks.

Oh, dont be that way.

She did?

Dont be ridiculous. Its late and the place is empty. Just take my car.

Yeah, kind of.

Sorry, can you give us a moment?

Hey, yourself.  I see youve met my ex.

Its not supposed to be anything, Kat. Its just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I dont know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--

Kat.

You have feet?

Youre funny.

I dont do naked. My sister? She does naked.

Youre too good for him.

Why?

I think thats disgusting.

This happened to you?

I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.

What?!

I guess so.

My sixth-grade science project was entitled, Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus. Trust me, Im careful.

So, whyd you say yes to me?

Make out with you for free.

Hi.

I wasnt saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.

Therapist.

Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.

I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. Youre here for the highland flings, I bet.

Just drunk enough.

Will do.

David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.

Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.

Uh huh...

That's right--

Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?

Sure--

What he talk 'bout?

What do that mean?

I did look, Charlie, but I--

Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.

Yes, sir...

We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?

Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.

What happened afta that?

Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?

Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.

Yes, son. You better get back to bed.

I got to, Mama. I know Daddy wants to see him.

Come in, children.

Thank you, Miss Boatwright.

Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .

I'll walk...

I'm used to it.

What did the Lord tell you, Ike?

Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.

At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!

I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.

Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.

I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.

It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.

I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!

Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.

Now go, your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.

My head hurts.

Doggy.

Montana.

Eric!

About what?

They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.

-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?

Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!

Okay.

Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!

Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.

Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-

I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...

What Cartman?!

I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!

Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-

Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.

Uhh...

Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.

MOM!!!

Uhh... Bacon.

FREEZE!!

No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.

Kay.

Oh... Alright, back you go.

No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU - we don't know where the hell we are!!

Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.

She's not my girlfriend, dude!

Yeah...

It isn't fair!

Me?!

As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.

Huh?

Oh God... What have I done...

What is Terrance and Phillip?

Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.

Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.

Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.

A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?

I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.

I know, Terrance. I know.

Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?

Hey, come here, guy.

<b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>

Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!

Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.

That's nice, Stan.

Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.

Hi Stan.

<b>Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for</b>

And ze rope?

Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.

Oh yeah...

Anna...

They're not going to make it!

Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -

I'm sure I will.

I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.

Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.

Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.

Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -

That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.

Then we've got to get to the lifepods!

Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?

That's me.

Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!

That's clear.

Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!

Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?

I don't know.

Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.

Even if we do, it might be too late.

Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.

At this point I'm ready for anything.

Yeah?

It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.

That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.

A flare?  A flare won't do it.

What?  What are you talking about?

I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.

Taylor!  Where are you?

Hopefully sooner than later.

We have room!  Let's go!

And so far.

I don't know.  Wave to them!

There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!

Are you nuts!  It's too risky!

The engines!

The pin machine?

Nope.

Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.

You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!

You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.

Lemme see your ball.

You afraid we're gonna steal it?

Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.

We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?

A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.

Theo.

Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.

They suspended me for 100 years.

What's it look like to you?

I gotta survive.

I didn't think so.

That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.

I am underground.

Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.

I never saw you.

I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.

Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.

Millie, I know what I'm doing.

You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.

Hello, mom?

Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.

You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 

Junior who?

It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".

I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.

He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.

Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!

Bowling "Center"!

That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.

No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.

Yippy!

Mine, and they never tip.

What do you want with my dad?

Everything has it's drawbacks.

I'd rather you didn't.

So, what about you?

I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.

If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.

Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?

Why not?

He's my father.

You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.

It?

I told him you were my boyfriend.

Tell me what happened Theo.

I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.

Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.

Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.

You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.

If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.

Your time is up, busyboy.

Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.

Open it, Captain!

How long will that be?

Yeah.  I heard you.

What if it attacks?

What do we use for defense?

Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.

From what?  What's with all the security?

Storm?  What storm?

They didn't tell me anything.

Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.

As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.

Hold on --

What team?

ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?

I don't know.  That's the point.

You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --

-- and then brought her down here --

-- without a cautionary word to anyone.  You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, "When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."

The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.

Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.

Working on it now, sir.

Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.

Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --

What the hell is going on here?

Yes, Harry.

So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.

It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.

How do you mean, strange?

It's not ignorant.

Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.

What?  No, I know they're civilians...

Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.

Too big?

What was Edmunds doing outside?

Underwater?

Good theory, Ted.

Get this thing off me.

My gosh, Norman.

What about you?  What happened to you?

Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.

What?

Don't bother me, Norman.

Why should I go?

You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...

You fixed this suit?  Beth?

What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?

Fixing it.

We must've had it delivered then.

All I know is I opened that refridgerator --

Squids?

What?

What do you mean, a part of Harry?

Something for burns.

Bingo.

Antibiotic.

Where are you?

What do you mean, different?

Your watch.

You tell me.

Don't you?

Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.

C'mon -- what?

When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?

It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.

But I have to, Norman.

Don't fuck with me, Beth.

You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?

Don't you know?

It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.

I --

Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.

Who says it's a he?

A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.

No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.

Look, would you --

Whatever I can do to help.

You mean, you think I'm cracking?

You don't understand about the sphere.

Did I?

I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?

When I woke up, nobody was here.

The three of us.

Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?

Stop what?  What are you -- ?

Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.

Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.

Shut up and catch.

No idea.

You mean forget?

Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.

That's right.

If it is an alien spacecraft --

See?  No code.  What'd I say?

Thank you.

Does this mean what I think it means?

The ships?

The others, sir?

Captain who?

Really?

What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?

He's a pussy.

You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?

Like what?

This is like nursery school.

Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.

When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.

I don't know.

Well, I've brought you here.  What now?

Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?

Is that good or bad?

You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.

I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.

You could put it that way.

I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?

But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!

Could I learn to feel it?

But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.

Don't you have a Kiber crystal?

That's where my father was killed.

Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.

Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.

But there was a lot of firing earlier...

What's that?

Send one squad up.

Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.

Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.

What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?

I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?

We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.

You don't believe in the Force?

Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.

Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.

There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.

I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.

But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!

You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...

If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.

Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.

I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.

I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.

I'd consider it an honor.

It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!

Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !

You heard the Lieutenant ! On the bounce, troopers !

Sir... I guess I do, sir.

What's the hurry ?

Your father will never let you.

Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?

I got Games & Theory.

I'm getting better.

Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...

They revoke our flight status.

Hey, check it.

Don't change the subject. Am I right ?

Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?

Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.

Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.

Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.

Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.

Good luck at the academy.

I don't even know if you're my girl.

Who cares ?

Shhh...

Naw, I made it, Carl made it.

We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.

He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.

Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...

No thanks, Diz.

You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.

I'm gonna need a squad leader.

What ?

Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.

Looks like rain.

It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.

Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !

Oh, is that how it is ?

Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.

Keep trying, Sergeant.

AAAAAAAAAAA !

Courage, I guess.

Aw, don't get mushy.

I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?

Yeah, that's right.

Been better, buddy.

Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.

This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...

Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.

Good for you. Go find out.

To join with him.

The Creator has not answered.

Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.

V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.

Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?

By the Creator.

To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.

May I ask Why?

None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.

It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.

   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.

I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?

Opinion, Mister. Spock?

Viewer, standard ahead.

He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.

Hold relative position here...

That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.

Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?

And whatever you sensed out here....

Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.

Any reply from them?

Our... 'insignificance'?

But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.

Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.

Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!

Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?

Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.

There is no alternative.

I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'

To you, sir?

Helm ready, sir.

Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...

Tractor beam remains constant...

He'll eat potroast and like it.

You bet your life.

Who?

You wrote a play on it, what play is that?

What's it called?

You quit.

Yes...

No, no, I see...

No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...

Everyday things...yes.

Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...

You're still here.

<u>Yes</u>...

They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.

What?

You got a paperclip?

Paperclip?

I don't drink.

I used to go out with a politician.

Go you Huskies!

I can't get it to come out right.

I hurt you?

Sleep well?

Yes...

Now you're talking...

...the better to eat me with, your dear?

I saw...

But that's what happened.

That's so beautiful...

Sure, but...ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty <u>million</u> dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...

We had a date.

Where have you been...

Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...

Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...

We'll work it out...

Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.

Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.

Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?

I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!

Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...

Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...

...they run on water.

You know who the <u>father</u> is...?

She wasn't in the...

...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.

I never touched her.  My mother's gr...

I <u>know</u> my lines...

No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...

I'm having dinner with W...

We missed you in Church today, Frank.

Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.

Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...

Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...

Everybody needs a hob...

I'm ready!

I just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...

Mr. Barrenger.

Of course he...

I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...

There's other things to be learned.

Mr. Bailey.

But we...

Oh.

I...

How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...

Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...

It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...

...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.

Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?

What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.

He treated me as if I were a child...

Who got their heads cut?

I, uh...I'm leaving.

Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...

Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?

I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.

Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.

No.  No, but we're planning to.

My wife just went into labor...

You mean <u>with White</u>...?

Sure.

"Suspicions of arson, these fires, believed set by a disturbed Teenager, were, in fact, the inspiration for the formation of..."

You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?

I have to talk to you.  My wife...

My wife is going to have a baby, and...

You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?

I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.

I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.

I can only write on a manual.

Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...

That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...

It's not <u>you</u>, it's...

I have to tell the truth.

No.

I...?  I saw it.  I was there.

I left that for you.

They're coming Fedex...

"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."

He's got a gift for fiction.

There's no witnesses...

Look, Carla.  This is a hard time for you.  Many young people go to Hollywood. I did...And we all dream of it, and here, here Hollywood has come to you...

Is he cool or angry?

You tell me what to do, I'll do it.

Sherry, this...

Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...

I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.

...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...

...it is?

So we just got lucky.

No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...

Givvem a cigarette...

Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...

I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.

Excellent point.

What are you gonna talk about?

Then why are you putting on mascara?

No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...

Secret's safe with me.

Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!

...I'm not deaf, y'know.

This is a joke, right?

Oh, yeh.

You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!

And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?

Here.

Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!

MOMMY!

Honey, she won't d...

Suits me <u>fine</u>!

IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!

No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.

You owe me a quarter.

No!

Annabelle let's get something clear.

Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!

Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.

What honey?

Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.

You have the WORST flu since...

Before you.

Rache can do that part.

You've got a fruit loop in your hair.

Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.

Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.

No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.

I'm here.

We're not discussing your age.

Don't do this.

And I'm supposed to care.

We're going to win this.

Look, I...

Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.

I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...

I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...

Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.

Nobody likes a snoop.

How the hell would you know?

Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.

Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.

Beats me.  Ask your mom.

I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'

And you said...

Thanks, but it's under control.

...go to the park.  In the worst way.

Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.

And her...?

Who in the world <u>is</u> he?

Are we.

Oh please.

And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.

Double.

No, there isn't.

I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.

Uh.  You hate my guts?

You'll learn.

It was a veal stock, I thi...

We have to talk.

So I'll have to order in?

Nobody's telling them to hate you --

No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --

And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...

I think so...What do you think?

Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?

I know that.

What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.

Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.

No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'

I'm gonna get me a drink.

Maybe he's gay.

He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...

He was in a concentration camp?

Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?

Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?

Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.

No.

Mi Jesusmi jesus

My Jesus

He's dead.

Jesus was not bad.

He wasn't.

For rape and murder.

You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.

OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.

Hip alternative types who will understand the process better

Well, I need to see this with an audience!

Boys, take napkins...Napkins...

I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.

You know he hated my story also.

Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!

Man, it's just, like, conversation.

Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.

Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.

Thanks.

Well, now you have.

Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...

Say, 'Nigger.'

Oh, fine. How are you?

Oh, I don't remember that...

Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...

Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?

Yeah.

Eight, six, and four.

Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.

So where'd you get in?

But what did you get on your SATs?

Don't be. Your movie's a hit.

Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.

What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.

We're outta here--

What happened!

Yeah?...

Rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.

Even better.

She's still alive.

She's as good as gone...

I'll let the senator tell you.

I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.

Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.

I say we head out.

The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!

All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.

Certainly - how about some breakfast?

Moffo!

Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.

That's preposterous!  We have no such program!

Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!

I know nothing of the sort!

Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.

I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.

Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?

Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?

Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!

What did you say, sir?

Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.

To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.

I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.

This is General Ripper speaking.

Do you recognize my voice?

Yes, sir.

General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.

Yes, sir.

Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.

That's right, Major.

And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?

Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?

Perfect.  Thank you, Major.  And now let's drink a toast.

To peace on earth.

He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.

That's close enough, Major.

That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?

Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?

No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.

Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?

What the hell is Plan-R?

I want to talk to General Ripper.

They're coming in now.

Naturally I am, sir.

Well, the Premier doped it out pretty well. Its primary is their missile base at Laputa.

Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.

No, they wouldn't send us in with bombs on an exercise.

Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?

What?

Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.

Speed?

Yeah?

Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.

Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!

Some kind of signaling.

I've got one.

Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?

Primary trigger switch.

First safety.

Check, ten thousand air burst.

I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???

In the back...feels like an arrowhead.

Listen, give me a shot quick!

But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.

Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.

But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.

It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?

What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?

But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?

"Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think?

Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!

No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.

Yeah.

Why is everything about you, Jeff?

I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.

Typical male.

Yeah, when's he coming?

Oh. Well, what's it on?

A cloud?

No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.

I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?

Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.

Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?

What?

Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.

You wanna bet he's with a girl?

No, no.

No, no, I wasn't trying.

No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.

Uh, last night...

No.

She's in the van.

Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.

No, no, no.

Alright. 'Bye, Buff.

I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.

Wait, what happened to the tree?

Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"? Been on the road opening for "Midnight Hore". Stadiums, man.  Wait, so Pony's coming by here?

Shit.

I'm so burnt-out.

This is private property, my friend.

Are you talking to me?

You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.

Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.

Oh, you were there?

Hey, thanks, man.

You know? I remember coming here with my parents.

"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.

I could.

No, not really. Middle-class.

Maybe upper-middle-class.

He is.

Military marching bands.

Taking care of business.

Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.

Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.

Wow, that must be pretty nice there.

Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...

Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.

Wow. You did that for me?

Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?

Good, good. I, I hope he does.

Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?

That, that's Indian?

I don't know.

That's right.

No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.

Man?

I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.

Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.

One!

Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.

Nothing.

Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?

So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?

Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.

Yes, you do.

But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.

No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.

I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.

Well, what about us?

No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.

Oh, fuck it, man!

Just go.

Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?

Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.

Nah, nah, nah, nah.

Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?

Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!

I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.

What?

You know what I'm saying?

No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.

Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?

Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?

You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!

Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!

This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.

No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.

It's stupid.

Look at you!

It's pretty exciting.

Oh, no, man. I can't.

Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?

If...

Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.

You do?

Where do you get your ideas?

Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.

I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?

What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.

Whatever.

Don't do that, man, okay?

Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?

Uh, eleven twenty-five.

I'm here.

Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.

Hey, Tim.

Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.

Oh that's nice for you.

There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".

Look, it's really not my fault.

You sure?

If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?

So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.

Yeah.

Y'think?

Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.

But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.

But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...

Di, it's not your fault.  We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves.

Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?

Oh, why didn't you say.  For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you.  The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash.  Take it or leave it.

I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...

It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!

Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.

I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.

Definitely old.

But you're not married.

My what?

Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.

More proof God's a guy...

I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...

Hi, Artie.

In a deep freeze.

Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.

What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?

The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.

Are you hungry?

I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.

Sorry if I crossed you up.

So long.

Well, for heaven's sake!

Why should you do that?

Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...

I'll make it short.

You're tough, all right.

Don't you sometimes hate yourself?

Who's who?

Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.

Second generation, huh?

Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...

I just don't.

Hello, Mr. deMille.

Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.

Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.

Why?

I think that's what it says on my driver's license.

Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.

Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.

Thank you.

Where do you live?

What's wrong with It?

I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.

Cute.  Let's have some drinks.

Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.

Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?

A little.

"Mad about the boy."

What right do you have to take me for granted?

Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.

You're a darling.

I ran into some people I knew.

Where are your...?

I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.

He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.

Yes, Norma.

Why do you say that?

I haven't done anything, Norma.

You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.

Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.

No, they don't.

Go on in.

Dressed for what?

Good.

She is upstairs.

You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.

I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...

She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.

I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.

That's right.

More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.

Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.

No?

Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.

Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.

Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.

Yes.  Madame.

Who?

Thank you, Max.

But the phantom Zone is for criminals.

It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.

Softball.

Eliminate her.

Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.

No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.

She didn't take it from you, did she?

There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.

Who didn't?

No.

Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.

What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?

I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...

In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.

How do I fight it?

Hmmm?

Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.

I did.

What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.

A passionfruit smoothee.

I don't know. You seem afraid.

That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.

Why George, are you proposing?

He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.

Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?

Oh, sure.

How do you know?

Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!

You're supposed to guess.

As brave as my father. As wise.

I don't understand.

Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.

But what for?

I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.

Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.

No, MR. Danvers.

I'd love to.

You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.

You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.

Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.

It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.

Not yet.

For what?

Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.

This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?

What? Palace? Hardly.

Then come with me.

Better than when I was a child.

Don't stop. Keep moving.

Too late. Too late. Save yourself.

Zaltar!

Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.

The kid needs a man to show him --

Sure, Lana, I'd love to.

The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --

There's a lot of choices here.

Well, this pate is rather...unusual.

Can I help?

Uh-huh.

Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.

Let me do it for you, Mr. White.

Mom and I do this all the time.

Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.

Say!

Oh?

I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.

Mmmmm . . .

What's that?

At one o'clock in the morning?

What are you doing?

What about this week's check?

One.  And a half.

Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.

Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...

Uh...

Yeah? What do you do with 'em?

Yeah, yeah, I can do it.

Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.

Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.

Fair's fair.

We've already got some.

What will it do?

What will it get me?

It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.

Exactly. Stoned mother.

Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!

Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.

I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?

Just a second.

I didn't have my camera with me.

I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.

I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.

No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?

Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.

Hey, I know a lot of things!

But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!

Why do I have to do this?

Missing????

He's bound to slip up sooner or later.

Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.

Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.

A normal person.

We can get to work on that oil!

Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?

It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.

Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.

But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.

I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?

Lois, I . . .

Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .

Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.

Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?

Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --

Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --

No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.

What else is ballast for?

You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.

Why am I doing this? Why am I here?

What'd he say before? He saw a girl?

Yes, but it's not all I feel.

Yes.

No possibility for parole?

I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.

Oh! That black box in our cell?

We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.

The son of Jor-El on this Planet?

Constantly.

Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.

Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.

Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .

Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .

Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.

It will. Starting with your own.

Free!

And so I was yesterday. And the day before.

And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.

This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.

No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.

Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.

If you say so. Here goes.

I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.

Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.

But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.

I'm not so sure you do.

Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.

I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.

Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.

Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.

Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.

Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?

One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.

. . . And  very naïve!

Who?

Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?

Our other dinner guest.

Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .

I must have miscalculated. How. . .

Get the box, nephew.

Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?

He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.

This wasn't in the plan.

For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.

First, I have fun.

I am master now.

Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.

You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!

I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.

Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.

Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.

High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.

Bunkers!

Albert!

Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.

Well!

Not really, no.

But otherwise it's swell.

He may have a gun!

No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.

They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.

It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?

You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?

Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.

The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.

First the pets, Otis.

See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?

Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?

Bingo!

I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.

You?! How about me?

I know...

Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!

Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.

Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.

On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.

He sure as heck does that.

Folks'll ask question.

Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.

Don't brag now,  Jonathan.

A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.

How good it felt!

You think they're strange?

I guess they are a little odd.

Thirty-five.

Pink.

Sure.

Very much.

Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...

Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!

You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --

Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?

Of time, Luthor.

You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!

We'll see how fast I can fly.

Alison Jones.

I'm fine.  Still working with my father.

Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?

No you don't.

No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.

The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.

Why are you telling me this?

Was it good?

Okay.

Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.

I'm not sure.

Billy, please.  The children.

She's resting.  In her room.

It does concern me.

Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.

What do you mean by that, Dolores?

You talked about it?

You mentioned that he had a learning disability.

Did they give him special care?

I did.

What other people?

We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?

Yes.  It's a present.

Did he say what about?

What, Mason?

Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?

You hate that.

I won't lie.

You seem very sure about that.

Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto

Yes.

Don't you want to hear?

Who are you?

Who did they get for that?

Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.

Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.

Yes, I understand.

I told you I was positive.  The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.

Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.

Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.

Great.

Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?

Yeah, right.

How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.

Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!

Alone or surrounded?

You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.

Don't apologize for me, Frank!

We're on our way there now...

Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.

Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.

I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...

Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.

Give me a chance --

You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.

You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...

History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...

I thought we were talking about Sidney?

Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.

Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?

Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.

J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!

I read your column every day...

Sure you can if you want to, and I know you'll want to...  By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney?

With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.

Can't hurt...

Integrity - acute, like indigestion.

Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.

She knows now.

And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?

You're sure.  Find out for me.

At the bar - Sidney...

In his apartment -

Can you be there by two-thirty?

And he's a perfect stranger to me.

The renting agent and the tailor.

Nothing...

Why not you?

Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.

Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?

Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.

Why should he put on an act?  Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do!

Yeah.  A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week!  This is my press agent, Joan.

Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...

But he isn't going to like this, Susie.  And he makes you nervous, not me.  No, I take that back - he makes me nervous, too.  But I wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you.

Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?

Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...

But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney!  I couldn't do that, Susie...

But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...

I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.

Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!

In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?

No one must follow your work.

My mission is to protect you.

Liquid metal.

You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.

We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.

Max.

Why?

Cool.

No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.

"Hasta la vista, baby"?

Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.

She intends to change the future somehow.

Dyson.

Drive faster.

Terminated.

Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.

No!  Don't kill him!

Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.

Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.

It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.

Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.

If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.

There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!

So do you.

Why attack Russia?

Son of a bitch, I knew it!

Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now. Don't pack.  Let's go.

Please continue...

Respect your elders and your betters!

Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.

But I promised your mother.

I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.

You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.

Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.

Five minutes.

But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?

Yeah.

With more what? More what?

Colonel. Pleasure.

There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.

What museum?

No can do.

Yes.

Three months.

My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.

There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.

Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.

Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.

If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?

That is correct.

I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.

I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.

That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.

If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.

I wasn't told. I just knew it.

I wish to say something.

This is absolute nonsense!

What?

Of course I know what that is.

I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?

It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.

One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?

You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 

His private life?

Yes.

I don't know what you mean, Major.

Nope.

Sure.

Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?

You're late.

A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...

All.

You're a big help.

I thought you did.

We will, kiddo.

What's it to ya?

Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.

Kyle.

Caught one?  You mean you got shot?

What?

Why?

Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.

I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...

Good fighters.

We did it, Kyle.  We got it.

Cover...our footsteps...

Yes.

Why?

Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...

I guess so.  You're a doctor?

You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.

I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.

I just called.

I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.

Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...

There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.

Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.

"Whereas once I was blind, now I can see."  Night, Nick.  Best of luck.

Then, you kiss his ass.

Please, don't do that...

Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.

Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.

What are you talking about?

You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?

What's C.R.S.?

... two hundred dollars a toe.

I think not.

Right.  Call me Christy.

It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?

Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...

No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.

I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.

What are you talking about... ?

Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.

What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...

I'm back from the dead.

What are you doing?

Fuck you.

You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.

What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?

I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.

Like... where are you from?

Studied acting, I assume?

Underwear?

Which grad-school?

How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?

Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?

"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?

Like a stroke?

I'm going to call.

You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.

Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?

Stop this.  It's not true...

Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.

Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...

Yes, very lucky.

What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...

Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?

You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.

I'll call.  I really will.

What kind of vacation?

Humor me with specifics.

Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".

You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.

Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.

No, you didn't...

Have a nice day.

Ilsa... you're alright?

I'm not sure.

It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...

Look, where is he?!

Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?

Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.

Don't ask.

That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.

Sam...  Thank you.

Attempted murder.

What?

Uh... Nell Vance...

It's somebody's idea of a joke.

Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?

Why?

Do we still get paid for the week?

Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.

And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.

Luke.

He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.

You could have.

No.

You want company?

And that will be a good place to end this study.

Mary, I'll meet you outside.

But there's a sad catch to the story.

For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry...

That smell... oh, God.

I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.

I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.

It was.

It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.

It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?

Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.

No --

Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?

It's okay... we're all here...

Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.

Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?

Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.

You're okay.

You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.

What's his first name?

No, it's getting worse.

Maybe you did it yourself.

I don't know what to think anymore.

Well?

Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.

-- What do you think?

Just had to be sure.

Is that a problem?

Well, you're certainly not a person.

It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?

Oh, god.

I'm sorry.

Sure.

We all did.

Why not?

Not bad.

Where do we go?

Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you.

And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.

There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.

Lookin' good.

What'd you call that -- the Protector?

Eduardo.  Rama.

Did Jenny know?

I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.

Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.

It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?

Faith.

You goin' back inside?

Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.

Really.

Well, those are the breaks.

Not her brand.

Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?

Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.

Try calling me again.

Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.

How'd you manage that, then.

Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.

Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.

Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.

-- Mr. Lindgren.

Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.

Why not.

What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].

You ever been to London?

Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.

Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?

She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.

She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.

Up the coast.

I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.

What's in Big Sur?

How do you know?

You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...

Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.

Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.

Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.

Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.

Sorry.  Wasn't me.

Where else?

Nine years?  Is that legal?

Five thousand.

Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?

Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."

Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?

Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.

No trouble.

You know I don't live with him.

I don't.

I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.

Be seein' you.

We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed.

At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.

A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.

I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.

Boy.

He didn't say that.

...Uh-huh.

Ah... it's nothing.

Uh-huh.

I don't understand.

I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--

Huh.

Ed.

Way out of line.

Cash.

That'll be fine.

And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--

Mm.

How's business, Dave?

Well, you know what that would do to me.

But it's...

So you paid the guy?

Big Dave--

Honey?

Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.

I didn't say a word.

What happened to you?

You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.

Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.

You don't have to tell me anything.

No. Of course not. She didn't do it.

I took Doris's keys.

Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.

I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...

Oh, hell. Drink?

OK. Boy. Jesus!

I know who you are, Mr Crane.

Yeah.

Yeah.

OK.

Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--

He's the dead guy.

Hello, Walter.

Hello.

Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--

Could you come with me please?

Homicide.

Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.

Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?

He said OK. Is that what he said?

Great.

Do they have to wear uniforms?

Let's go!

Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!

You said the system couldn't fail!

Where the hell are you?

Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.

Not at all.  I think we may be working on the same case.  If so, I could use your help.

I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?

Call me Vince.

So the method of death is the only connection?

Correct.

We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.

This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.

There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.

I know.

You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.

Not so loud.

Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.

Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.

The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?

I don't believe it.

Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."

Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.

Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.

I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.

He's right.

She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.

Like this.

The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.

Keep the light up.  I can't see.

Quiet.

Another storage room.

Keep the animal quiet.

Frock's been fired.

I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.

An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.

With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.

You were going to be married.

What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?

I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?

Would you mind showing it to me?

Where did you see it?

When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.

It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.

No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...

It's scared of me.

No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.

I think... for the pleasure of the kill.

It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.

Oh God!  Help!

I have to shoot.

I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.

<i>Fiji.</i>

It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.

What's to see?

That and a fat, new contract.

But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?

Certainly a nomination.

Let me demonstrate some examples.

All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.

We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.

I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.

Guess I always thought they'd adopt.

Oh, yes.

That's right.  Lauren.

I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.

No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday?

If we don't go now, it won't happen.

I...I can't.

You think so?

Your Dad?!

How about them?

I told you I can't.

They're...  perfect.  Thank you.

Gee, that's great.

A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on.

I won't be late.

Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.

I made macaroni.

I don't know--

I bet you did.

Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.

--What the hell are you talking about?!

Truman, stop it!

I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?

I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?

You can count on it.

We don't even know you.

Yup.

Does what?

You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.

Yes.

Nothing completely conclusive --

No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.

No. Don't bother.

No. Just fossils, far as I know.

No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing...

Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --

Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?

What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.

Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.

Yeah, well I don't have them all.

Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.

Where are you, Scully?

I think they have that covered.

No you didn't.

Scully, I found the bomb.

I'm in the vending room.

Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.

All I told them was the truth.

They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.

I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.

They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.

There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.

I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.

I'd been told as much.

It looks pretty green for this climate.

I don't know, Mulder.

We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.

I don't know why I think they went right.

This is great. This is fitting.

Mulder --

For the purpose of what?

You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.

I think... something stung me.

Where are we?

Thank you.

And they want to blame us?

I want to know where Scully is.

Driver.

I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.

The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.

And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.

You need not kill a man to destroy him.

Lucien Baines?

She thinks I can bring Edward back.

Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?

I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.

He needs to be turned over.

Four and twenty blackbirds...

As far as I needed.

It doesn't have much to do with science.

I did, yeah.

I can't leave him!

No problem.

He's beautiful...

's broken.

Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.

They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 

Initiating connection.

What's wrong?

She's bringing Stargher into hers.

Sometime yesterday morning.

Dr. Kent.

Completely unaware.

It's his dog.

Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.

She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.

I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?

He has a little dog.

That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.

I was told there were only two men there.

Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?

Whiskey.

In German?

I'm so sorry.

A parrot...Let it go.

Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?

Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.

Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.

How did you know I would be here?

I shall be all right.

Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.

You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.

There's nothing in them.

No.

Where's Harry?

I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.

Ever seen one?

You're not locking her up?

As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.

Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.

In Vienna...

Bring him in.

I'm not asking you to.

Thank you. Excuse me.

Which side of the road?

Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...

Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.

I'll be your dumb decoy duck.

I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.

I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.

Oh, Mr. Martins...

Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...

It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.

Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.

You can help her.

As long as they can use you?

Coffee.

Tension? KURTZ Suspense.

At the end of every chapter --

Here?

What did he say?

A Roumanian.

Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.

But you will.

The Roumanian?

Who else?

Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.

Not when I get interested.

Yes.

Help you out?

I'm sorry, I don't think so.

Just take it, OK.

I don't think so.

I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.

One or two kilometers.

Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.

So?

Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.

Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?

You can swim?

Two.

No.

Richard, you know something -

Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.

He's an asshole.

No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.

Nobody reads that stuff anymore.

Yes, I am. Basically I am.

Oh, really?

No.

What do you care?

Why?

They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...

Even though his dick is so big?

Don't curse in front of it.

Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.

'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.

Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?

Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.

Who's Eichmann?!!?

What'd you say?

Did you see how they reacted to him?

It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.

People hate Jews. Do you agree?

How would you kill him?

A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.

In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?

Notice? Like what...?

I don't know. Is that right?

Female...

He has Israel.

He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.

No.

With the shoes... There was more than one?

I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.

But I wasn't.

I can't say that.

You mean Ilio Manzetti?

No, I don't admit it's stupid.

They're not my people....

Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.

You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.

Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs.  A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.

What...?

Keep driving. Don't slow down.

So what do we do with the device?

Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?

Four. But no one this important.

No.

What?

... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.

Yes.  Not like Enzo.

But your man isn't quite a God!

Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.

Hello!

It's the Free Diving World Championship.  I am by the way world champion!

No.

No.

You going to sleep here, all by yourself?

Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.

Enzo!

You know what I'm talking about.

Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!

I won't, I swear.

Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?

Six seconds.

I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  I can take a five minute nap, can't I?

"That"!  This is not a "that"...

The rules are the rules.

It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.

That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I'll see you there...

Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.

... You married?

Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.

No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?

... I'm listening.

You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?

No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.

I don't want to erase anything.

Thank you.

I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.

Well that's very nice of you.

I can't.

... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?

Only to help the medics, I assure you.

No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!

Uh... Yes, of course!

I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.

I'm still here.

I didn't dive.

You go back, I'll walk.

That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.

Anything.

No.

I brought Johana to meet you.

No, no.  It's true.  When I was in New York, oh boy!  Before my accident, you understand? 

Well... here.

You called the police?

Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.

I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.

Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.

One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...

Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.

Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.

My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.

I said, do you come here often!?

I said, yeah, about once a week!

Yes Esther.

No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...

I forgive you.

Mordechai!

Happy Hanukkah Morty.

Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.

Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.

The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.

Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.

While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.

That's some cold shit.

Resting?

It's Friday.

That depends. How much money has he?

Nice fellow?

You found the leopard!

What arroyo - how did you get to it 

I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --

What are you doing that for?

Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --

You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...

Rosita  I have wondered -

Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.

No. I'm quite sure.

Sure -- certainly - but what's that got to do with this?

Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.

About Charlie's leopard?

I don't know.

I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?

To know where that leopard went -  I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little freshwater college back East. I gave that up.

Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.

Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone 

Thanks, Sheriff.

Why?

Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...

No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.

I thought - is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.

Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?

And I never will -- you know what's between us - we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.

I know. Funerals.

If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.

You're positive of that, aren't you?

I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.

I know -- Teresa -

I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"

Must it?

Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?

I work here, sir. Im here most of the time.

Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.

I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.

You... You found that at Leons?

What... What are you talking about?

Oh no. Youll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.

The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.

Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight Im convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.

You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. Theyre in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.

The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.

Have you finished?

It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. Whats harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?

No!

My brother hung himself.

Leon hung himself...

Leon could still have hung himself.

Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.

I didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!

Something like that.

Simplify and damn.

I didnt intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that youd been back.  That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...

Get to the point, will you...

Croissants. Like that...

A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.

Yeah.

Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didnt I hear you right?

Whos the guy? Whos the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate Id have had to kill him.

What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. Theres a lot of people back there. Theyre holding a seminar. Traffickings the past, breeding the future...

A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think Ill get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, itll be too late.

Have we done business before?

May I have your phone number?

This is a bad line.

Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?

Yeah... The Diplomat.

What kids?

Just me...  Martins gone back to the Ambassador. Look...

F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, Ive got to get to...

La what?

Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, très bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandémes services àquelquun récemment... Vous êtes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 

Your secretary, huh!

Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...

I hope its not too significant.

Okay. Recommended...

Do what, Mr Lombard?

I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.

Yesterday. It all looked normal.

No. And before you ask, no, hes not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...

Plus a trust fund to provide for the boys education.

I dont know what your problem is, but...

Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt...

Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...

Three oclock.

We need a double-room and as I understand youre here alone wed be much obliged if youd agree to move to a single room...

Should I come back in five minutes?

The ladys not a friend. Shes a whore.  Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.

An Austrian.

Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...

Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My fingers on the trigger, you hear!

Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leons not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.

Havent you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? Id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.

Good reasons?

Do you know Leons parents names?

Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...

Hows the boy doing?

Los Angeles?

Id appreciate it if I could use your phone.

I take it you dont know where he is, then?

Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.

Eh bien... Tes sûr que tas besoin de moi?  La petite ma lair assez bien foutue, non?

A lachat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais ça pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. Cest pas vraiment mon truc.  I dont know any Austrian, Xavier.

What do you think, huh?

Thats the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to, eh, French-fuck?

Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman whod called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.

Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didnt need your confession...

Majesty, I can't...

So... pretend it's not a game.

But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...

Tremoille... don't.  Please...

Now?

This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.

Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?

How dare you stop me doing God's will!

How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!

But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.

Well...

What... what do you mean?

But how do you know what you hear is the truth?

You make it sound so simple...

Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!

To marry you.

Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!

If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.

Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?

No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...

I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.

No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.

Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?

Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...

Well then?  Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!

Where... where am I?

Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.

But where are you going to be?

Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.

I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.

You have nothing to regret...

It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.

You think?

I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...

He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.

Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!

Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...

Noooo!

Go and ask him yourself.

20,000 gold crowns.

Everywhere.  Where is the food?

For what?

You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!

Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.

I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!

Not yet.

Damn right!

I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.

I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...

I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!

Of course I do?  Bring them up!

No...!

Why not?  He has good teeth...

Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!

Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!

We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...

No.

Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...

And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?

You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...

If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...

What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...

I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.

What do you mean, they won't come?

Yes... lots of things!

But... it didn't just get there by itself.

Oh no?  How about this one?

What for?

Do you think this cross will protect you?

I need to confess.

Whose were they?

Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.

I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.

And what does he say to you?

Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.

Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.

Yes.

Wladek, please.

I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.

He'll be back before curfew.

American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!

What's happened?

Tough luck.

Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!

It costs.

Yes, please.

Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.

I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.

Hungry.

Yes, that's why I brought it.

should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.

Toilets?

If you need help...

It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.

You made contact?

Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.

I am... I was a pianist.

The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.

Not yet.

Yes, like a cave.

... without a shred of manners.

Well, she was very violent with the gown. She tore off a chunk of lace. if hadn't been there I'd have sworn she'd used her teeth

The Alps.

Ada says you're doing well with the piano?

It was more to your wife that I gave it.

No, not words.

They are washed.

I just want to listen.

It must come.

You've missed this bit.

I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall. 

What's the line on Visitation?

He'll probably fall down.

You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.

How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!

What do we do?

Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.

Don't worry about it, pal.

You think my play is bad?

He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.

We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.

Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.

If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.

Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.

What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?

All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.

You sober?

And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.

If we ever get to it.

I thought I'd lost him.

A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.

Then why you doin' it?

Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.

Fancies himself a gambler, huh?

The wire is ten years outa date.

Raise 500.

Raise 5,000.

Don't have much choice, do ya?

You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.

Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.

2:00 A.M.

Yeh, sleepin'.

No.

What the hell for?

He'd like to kill me.

Yeh, this time anyway.

All right, when?

Okay, Tootsie.

Yeh, he knows that.

He hired a dame to take it from ya.

Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.

This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.

I am after this race.

I'm in.

Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.

You want your money back?  Try and get it in a court of law.  C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll make it worth your while.  Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out.

I didn't get the bet down in time.

Don't think I know him.

I'll make parole.

Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.

Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.

Yeh, but I don't know where he is.

I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.

Oh, Andy, Andy!

Give it to me.

Nonsense! She got at she deserved.

I didn't.

It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.

I don't think you will.  It's your father's.

Yes.

Oh, thank heaven.

Where did you hit her?

I bought it in a pawn shop.

He's been dead for three months.

Forgive me.  How are you?

You see how much we have to say.

What would your mother say to that?

And he still wants to marry me!

Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.

What'd he think it was to you?

You mean about that gun?

Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.

Who's your candidate?

I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.

Fifty will still get you a hundred.

Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.

I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.

Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...

You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?

Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?

Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.

Why yes.

No.

Goodbye.

Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?

How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?

I thought you said you weren't going there.

So I see.

This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.

Go ahead!

What did you do with the rest?

Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...

Good.

I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.

Is Julia going with you?

That's all right.  What are you drinking?

No word at all?

Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.

Well, don't you?

Yes...

That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?

I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.

Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.

He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.

And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.

You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.

Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....

He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?

I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it?

Oh, this is Andy --

We need ice.

I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.

What are you drinking?

Maybe it would if I took it.

They were kidding you.

Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.

Someone get a doctor.

He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!

Well, didn't you?

I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.

Let's see.  Where's it from?

You talk as if I were Asta.

Come on, Watson, we're going places.

I'm going to take Asta for a walk.

Looks like a hold-up!

I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.

Say you're the one who got me in this!

I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.

You wouldn't be a widow long.

Not with all your money!

I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.

Couple of months anyway.

Hey... hey.  Don't do that.

I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.

Thank you, Mrs. Charles.

I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.

Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.

Yes.

I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!

You did.

Y-yes.

Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.

You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.

We're going to keep driving.

We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!

Low on gas.  Got to refill.

Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.

For climbing.

And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.

Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.

What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.

You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.

I told you; don't push me around.

Why'd he come in our camp.

Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.

I out rank you, that's why.

Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.

It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?

Blow me.

Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.

Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?

What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.

You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?

It's the only way.  We drive!

I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.

I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.

I got that...sir.

Faster we get there, faster we get back.

Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.

Mine.

Mine.  Land mine!

I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!

Epps, my leg is falling asleep.

It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.

You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!

If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.

It's the treasure, that's what it is.

I hope it means something, otherwise...

Stay low.

We're not going to do anything.

What does it look like I'm doing?

I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.

We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.

Is it dead?

What?

It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.

Forget Wes.

Yeah.  Well, me too.

Yeah.

Makes two of us.

Damn.

You sure you want me too?

Okay.  Then we go this way.

Don't you touch it.

Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.

I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.

I just said I would.  I don't think I--

You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!

No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.

What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...

Thanks.

They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.

A headache?

Yeah, you're funny.

For real?  A treasure?

I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.

I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.

What?

What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?

Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?

A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--

Oh, God!

We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.

You have to go with us, Wes.

Anytime you want to do something about it just let--

We have to do something.

All last night he could have been--

Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.

Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?

Violation?

What happened?

No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.

You've seen enough.

Now.

Look,dirt!

That's not food.  Can't be food.

I don't know.

We could leave, and live in the superstructure....

A shelldweller.  They live in the outer shell of the city.  Quite unique, there have been two here before.  They smell.

It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.

I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.

Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.

No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.

I want you for my roommate.

It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.

Look more closely.

We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?

I don't care.

Soon he'll be a plastic cube.

No?

Yes...

Go ahead.

Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...

Thanks.

When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.

She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?

Where...?

You mentioned something called Redstone.

What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.

Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.

Me, too.

Off the scale.

Don't touch that.

Stay to your left.

That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...

Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.

When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.

No excuses, just do it!

Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not. 

Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?

Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.

Helluva fuck factor.

Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.

We've created a monster.

Taylor's dead.

Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.

Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.

I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.

She wanted to cook me breakfast.

Captain assigned me to assist you.

I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?

I thought I told you--

It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...

So you lost a handbag, madame?

Diamonds all over.

A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.

I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.

No!

Constantinople?

Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.

I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--

The type they marry.

I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.

I've got to see you.

No, to you--M'sieu <u>Monescu</u>.

What is it?

I know it!

M'sieu Monescu!

The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!

No--no.

Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.

Thank you.

No, thank you.

I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.

Gaston Monescu.

And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--

Seven and nine!

Yes!  Now don't worry!

At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!

<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.

Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?

That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--

Lily-- 

Lily!

Yes.

I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.

Well--I am Madame Colet.

Oh!

M'sieu Laval!

What's wrong now?

This used to be my secretary's room.

That sounds sensible. 

Then I mislay my checkbook--

Ye-es?

What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?

You're hired!

Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?

I know all your tricks.

Um-<u>hum</u> ...

And you expect me to believe that?

I don't believe it!

Divine ... But that terrible policeman!

What is it, madame?

I know!

Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.

You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!

Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.

Well--uh--yes and no.

I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.

How much is your salary?

Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...

He started it.

Well, where is it?

An hour, two at most.

What? You have to get to a boat right away!

Hurry, Rose.

You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.

Lewis...

Don't drop it Rose.

It's hers, you schmuck.  Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.

That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.

So do I.

You wanted to see the propellers?

Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?

I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.

Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.

Not the better half.

Can I bum a cigarette?

Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!

We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?

They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.

Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!

We got room for lots more. I say we go back.

Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go.  Well come on!

No, but we're making excellent time.

What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.

I know what ice fishing is!

Well, here you are.

That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.

That penguin last night, is he one of them?

If only it were that simple.

Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.

Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.

Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.

Sure. If you like.

You're still my best girl, Cora.

A mistake?

Sssshh. Come here.

Should I be expecting him anytime soon?

A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.

To the stars.

This is crazy.

And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.

What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.

I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.

Charmed, I'm sure.

Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.

Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.

Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.

Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.

Glad to see you again.

<U>Gladly</U>.

Where's Lother?

Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.

I'll bet a couple of hundred.

Fine--I'll be glad to.

I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.

I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>

I could stand some more--

No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.

Brett is the name.

Very--your mother?

Lonesome?

Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--

You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--

Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?

You can live that down, can't you?

Make it five.

I'll be waiting on deck.

No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.

How're the tips?

Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?

Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.

Now you're talkin'!

You take some awful chances.

<U>Me</U>!

Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?

Get it!

Hope I didn't keep you waiting.

Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?

That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.

Much better--thank you--

Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?

Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.

Why?

Swell!

Coming to the pool for a swim?

You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?

Why, I--

Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.

How?

Back is in New York.

Send that.

O.K.! Send that!

Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.

Oh,--we're doing about thirty--

No. <U>Knots</U>!

So what?

Well, did you find me?

Who won?

That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?

Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.

Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?

Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--

No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.

News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--

I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?

But not nice enough to marry--eh?

I'll never love anybody else.

Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.

Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--

Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--

Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?

Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--

Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.

Good-night, folks.

Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.

You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?

S'pose you've never thought of killing him--

Why?

Say, "Thanks very much!"

Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.

It all depends on what you're used to.

Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.

Now Ed, are we cross?

Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say!  Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.

Nice voice.

And you must be Doc Holliday.

Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!

Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.

Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.

Credat Judaeus Apella.

All right, lunger.  Have at it.

I was kidding about that.

Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.

Enough?  Never.

What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?

Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.

And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.

Ignore her?

You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.

Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.

Sorry, sorry...

I don't know.  It all happened so Fast.  If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know.

All right, Doc...

You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.

Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.

Not half as bad as I feel.

You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.

What?

Wyatt, are you crazy?

All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!

Never even heard of anything like it.

He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.

Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.

They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.

The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.

I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.

I think I'll just lie down awhile

I don't know.  I'm all right.

Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?

Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you?  Right out loud so I can hear?  Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt?  Will you do that?

McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-

Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.

Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.

I'll be damned...

Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.

What're you talkin' about?

Sure...

Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels.  Want to thank you For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.

Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.

I know, I need a keeper.

I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.

Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...

Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.

Yeah, and dangerous.

I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond.  Darling! Come here.  I want you to meet my wife.

I can feel your pain.

Sightseeing.

Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?

Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -

Good-bye, Mister Bond.

I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.

Ah, James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.

Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?

No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.

No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -

Do you?

One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.

Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.

Fishing?

I see...

If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?

I believe Q's exact words were:  "Hopefully, nothing."

Who knows? Fog, night...

That's reassuring.

Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -

- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.

Let's not make it a habit.

Think about mom.

Thank you.  "Now hear this: Drop dead."

No. I'm going with you.

... We have time for that?

...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.

Next time, I do the driving.

Hopefully, it won't get that far.

Good luck on your mission, 007.

Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?

I am. What do you want?

Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?

Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -

No -

Excellent.

Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.

My timing always was lousy.

Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -

I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!

Thank you sir! Thank you!

Will the cruise set it off?

Since when?

I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.

You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.

This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.

We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad.

Will you still get the money from your father?

Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.

I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...

He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.

Why in the h...

Like a veil has been lifted?

And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?

Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.

Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.

It is just a regular card.

This would be a bad time for me to leave.

Hush.

You're going to find yourself on the floor.

Babe Brother is a poor boy.

I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...

He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.

He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.

I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.

Everything these days is made overseas.

Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.

I'll be right there.

You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.

Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?

Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.

Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.

I thought you weren't old fashioned.

Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.

I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.

Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.

You know the man next door is near death.

I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.

I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.

Well, sure, we can leave it up.

Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?

But Mom, I can't find him!

But what if we leave them behind?

See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.

I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.

It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!

Rocky!  The ramp!

Watch yourself!!

The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.

No, you can't.

What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!

Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?

Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.

But we're not on my planet, are we?

This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!

Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.

You mean it has hyperdrive?

Alright Buzz, get ready...

Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.

No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.

Woody!

Look out!!

Woody!  The rocket!

Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!

How 'bout three out of five?

Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!

Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?

How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?

All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --

Nothing.

Last present!

So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.



What?!

Right here, Woody!

Sh-h-h-h-h!!

Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.

We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?

See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.

Speed up!

There's no mirror.

You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.

I did like the music.

Let me in.

Well ... yes. All right. But -

He'll be looking for another apprentice.

I've got a present for you...

Did you now.

Juliet who?

You're late for breakfast.

It's all right, Finn.

He never came home last night.  Was he with you?

Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.

I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.

Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.

What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --

I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.

I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with.

It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?

What?

Carl, that's insane.

Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?

Why?

She asked me not to.

Barbara --

I don't know.

How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.

I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.

How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.

Like I give a fuck.

Yes.

Cincinnati Country Day.

Yeah.

I'm third in my class.

Just watch.

I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.

Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?

You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.

Not Tiger Woods.

Yeah!

When will you do it?

That thought makes me feel awful.

Yes, sir!

I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.

They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.

Not this time.

What?

Everybody has a weakness.

I'm aware of that.

It's possible.

I have money --

You won't say anything to my parents?

Yes, I hope so as well.

What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.

What kind of research?

You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back --

If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.

You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.

You've stabbed me, man.

But it's not worth more than fifteen.

Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.

For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.

I'd fucking kill you.

Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.

Eh-

Right. You can't sleep here.

No, not holding hands.

And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.

Is that a promise, then?

Too young for what?

So why have you told me about it?

What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?

It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.

Oh, really?

Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.

Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?

The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.

No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.

I'd really rather take care of it myself.

And you might get the fucking job.

Nightmare.

Nineteen-sixty-seven.

OK, so who was it, then?

So who else?

Give me the gun.

When are you going to visit him?

I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.

About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }

We're two thousand short.

Stick it on my tab.

It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.

It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.

It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.

Magnificent. You are the first to find me.

Rescued at last.

But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.

I don't have a clue.

A Federation starship.

Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.

What do you know of my pain?

Join my quest.

What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.

Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.

I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.

MM.?

I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.

That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.

Captain, what have I done -

I have a half brother.

He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...

Is what possible?

Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.

That's a little vague, Spock -

The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.

I believe we are witnessing my birth.

Welcome aboard, Captain.

You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.

I'm afraid of nothing.

No conditions.







"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?

Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.

Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.

Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.

I belong here.

I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!

Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...

Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..

Uh... got any cinnamon?

You call that getting over it?

That Dillinger's on to him.

I'm certainly not.

Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?

Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...

Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.

No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.

No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!

So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?

I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.

End of line.

If you think -

You wouldn't dare.

It can be arranged...

Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?

They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...

No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.

All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.

A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...

Why? What are you going to do?

Shhhhh.

Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?

How 'bout yourself?

Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really...

The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?

PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.

We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?

Strategic Air Command.

He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.

We'll get them, sir... These things take time.

They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.

I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.

Why is everything...like this?

He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.

I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...

Why?

This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.

What?

For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.

Here, check these out.

Right.  She's only fourteen.

In her dreams.

Yeah, right.

Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?

Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*

It can't be.

I still don't believe it.

Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.

Yeah, but for who?							*

Aw, it's gotta be a typo--

There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.

Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in.

No!  Never!

That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.

Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.

It's certainly... dramatic.

Is that why you got into this business?

There is no us, you psychotic bitch.

It's not okay.  It's extortion.

I'll handle it.

It's okay, don't bother, Harry.

It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.

My husband the hero.

Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.

Yes.

What did you need?

Answer the question--

Yes or no.

What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.

I'm not wearing any.

Don't call me honey!  You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?!  You pig!

Ask me a question I would normally lie to.

No.  Much more.

Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.

Wait here.  If you have to use this, use it.  Don't choke. Okay?

Absolutely.

And you've got one.

Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.

Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!

Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?

You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?

He said he was an American agent.

Get going! 

Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?

I understand.

Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.

It's serious.  That's all I can				* say.  Just meet on K Street under				* the Key Bridge.  At eight sharp.				*

What is it you need me to do?

It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--

Helen.

Knock wood.

Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?

Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.

Don't eat anything.

Now hang up.

And here we are.

Would you like to get some pie?

There's nothing to tell.

What do you do?

What's your favorite color?

Would you like a bite of my pie?

Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.

Almost four years.

That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.

I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.

Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.

I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.

It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.

Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.

You will?

I don't believe so.

Thank you.

No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.

You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.

What?

Cancoon.

Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.

In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun.

Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.

I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.

He don't got no right to live.

Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.

Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.

Has he gotten his mail today?

Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?

Did you meet Captain Kirk?

Every word of it.

Yeah?

In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?

No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.

I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?

Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?

Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?

Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.

Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.

Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.

I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.

I bullshitted him.

Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?

You were a cop.

Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.

Sure was.

Or a supporting actor -

But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -

Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -

Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.

This guy's gonna kill him.

You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.

Pussy love pink rocks.

Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?

I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.

Do you know where we can find him?

No.

No, sir!  I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  And I have the experience, I know who the people are...

So that...???

It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.

No, 1995 is the past.

1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!

You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?

What?

And I was in it?  What did I do?

What will you do...when you find this...secret army?

I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.

James, why don't we...?

And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.

I thought you didn't know how to drive.

Shot!  Who shot you?

No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.

No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.

First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?

No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.

I...I...We need cash, James.

A Carpet Cleaning Company?

They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.

Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.

I need to make a telephone call.

What's that mean?

Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.

Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.

And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"

Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?

She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.

Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.

You can't do that yourself?

I'm sorry, I didn't--

That's 'cause he's dead.

See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then . . .

You want to make a kiddies bet?

Will be.

It is not.

I need a ticket.

I don't care, just get me there.

Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.

I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?

Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.

Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.

You believe that?

That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.

Yeah, you better remember that.

Let me have a Beck's.

Genuine Draft?

Yes.  Yes it is.

He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.

There's someone in the house.

What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.

I'm just going to my car.

Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.

Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.

All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.

I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.

Did you like it; me watching you?

Thank you.

A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.

Like they're made of polyester.

I have ideas.

You know what I want.

Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.

Yeah, I guess you're right.

You could just leave him.

You just walk away.

From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.

You live pretty good.

Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.

What was I supposed to do?

You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?

No.

He can kill us.  I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars.

Just drive.

But I want to say with you,

You closed it, didn't you, Grace?

Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.

Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?

What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.

Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.

My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.

Like you don't know.

Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.

Just ran into a little trouble.

That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.

A man doesn't always mean the things he says.

What makes you say that?

This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.

For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.

Do we shake hands?

The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.

I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?

I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.

And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.

Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?

No.

Trouble with the car again?

Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.

That's a thick change of heart.

That country shit all sounds the same to me.

No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--

That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.

You expect me to believe that?

Not before I settle with you.

Jesus!

Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -

Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?

Sure, Sheriff.

What for?

Senor, you need a doctor.

You can't do that yourself?

I said I was sorry.

Yeah, sure.  You got change?

Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.

What do you want for free?

So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.

Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...

Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.

No and I don't plan on sticking around either.

You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.

Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!

Stand up.

Oh, shit!

Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.

Accident.

That's a solid name.

You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.

It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.

About things.  About your wife.

A man doesn't always mean the things he says.

I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.

It's the truth, Jake.

I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.

That country shit all sounds the same to me.

What the hell are you talking about?

Nope.  Darrell.

Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...

Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.

Time.

About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.

It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.

Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.

You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.

Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.

Darrell.

That's none of your business.  Get the keys.

Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.

Maybe I don't want you to.

Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.

A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.

From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.

Come here.

Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.

Still playing?

Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.

No.

I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?

You could leave him.

You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.

Try me.

I don't think we have anything to talk about.

I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.

You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.

You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.

But I thought --

You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!

My mother died in this canyon.

'Cause I love you.

No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.

With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?

...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.

Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.

How much?

No Beck's. A-1, Coors...

Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.

Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.

No baby, you got it wrong.

Wrong number.

Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.

No! No! Please!

I said come on!

Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.

I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?

What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...

Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?

That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?

The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.

Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.

Yes. Is this David?

I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.

Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.

He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself.

Jeremy what the hell are you doing?

You assumed wrong.

Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.

You thought he was carrying a knife?

But not a knife?

It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.

What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?

Two hundred and seventy.

All of it.

You're lying.

Jeremy listen to what--

I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?

That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.

Okay.

No.

No?

We was... lyin'.

What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?

Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.

Ha. He was building his fucking porch.

'Course he's coming.

You ain't dead.

You don't look nothin' like me, mister.

Advances?

I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.

I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?

Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?

Property.

You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?

Yup.

I didn't hear nothin' till last night.

You could run off them two cowboys.

Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?

I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.

Uh... Duke.

You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?

Did you... kill him?

N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.

Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?

Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.

Well, how about it?

Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...

No.

Well... I don't recollect.

If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.

Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think.

After a ways.

Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days?

Yeah?

H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...

Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.

You ain't shot.

Eleven.

Nor Quincy, I guess.

Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.

Beats the hell out of me.

I didn't see nothin' planted.

Why would the Kid shoot at us?

Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close.

Yeah... you said that last night.

Not for me. I don't touch it no more.

Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.

Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?

Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...

What?

I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella.

We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?

He's blind, for Chri...

Yeah.

I don't like the question.

How many you killed, Kid?

We don't need him. The two of us could do it.

All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.

You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?

Yeah?

They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze

He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.

&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;

He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.

I'm having a stroke.

Just forget about it.

Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .

So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?

RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.

The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?

How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?

Dig.

If you'll just let me -

McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.

Maybe more.

Don't do this. Send her a card - something.

Who is he?

We want to meet him.

The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.

What'the fuck is that?

Someplace else, then.

I just want to hear your story.

I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.

The D.A. gave me immunity.

So why play into his hands? We can protect you.

Wait a minute.

I don't.

I don't know what you're talking about.

But Keaton...

I said I never heard of him.

I don't

Edie.

Because he was my friend.

Keaton was Keyser Soze

THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.

He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.

May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.

Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.

You thought it was just.

... yes.  Get her on the phone ...

Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...

Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.

I was her doctor.

...I was one of a group of...

Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?

That's right.

My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...

I know of him.

It's a crime.

Yes.

Yes.

I . . ..

You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.

I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.

...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...

'Code Blue'...

Well...

Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?

It was good of you to meet...

...What difference would...

It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.

I.  Yes.  It is.

Yes.

She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.

That's perfectly all right.  I'm kind of rushed.  Do you mind if we walk while we talk?

...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?

Who says that I'm protecting anyone?

I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.

Ready, your Honor.

If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...

Mr. Alito, please.

I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?

How come you're calling me from...?

Kathy Price.

My ex-husband was a lawyer.

Yes.  It was, actually.

Isn't there something you...

Who told you that?

Is there going to be a later...?

It's over!

I don't have a goddamned idea.

... I get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --I get this expert doctor to talk to you.  I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  You're 'sposed to be in court.  I bet you haven't even seen the file.

What do you want?

Don't touch anything.

I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.

...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.

Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.

Right.

You got a good memory, Franky.

I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?

Yeah.

I don't know.

I don't want a mistrial.

You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.

... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...

We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...

Yes.

You saw Kat in New York...   ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?

I did.

Yeah.

Yes, that's correct.

Huh.  And why is that?

Ah? That complicates the problem.

Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?

Why?

Why?

Dinner... and what else?

Okay.

I'll take care of you.

No.

But Scottie, you don't have to!

I'm trying to buy you a suit.

They're none of them right.

Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.

Judy --

We'll take it! Will it fit?

Ah, no!

You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?

Oh, no. You'll muss me.

I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?

I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.

Madeleine died here.

Take me away...

You can't. You're afraid!

But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?

Your accident...

You...  ...fell into the Bay.

What?

Well... anywhere in particular?

Only silence. It's always like this.

No birds live here.

Long ago...

What?!

No... it's in shadow.

No.

I'm here, I've got you...

At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --

I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...

You can't.

How long has she had the room?

When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.

I thought you said no more aches and pains?

Why?

Johnny, the doctors explained --

Oh!

What a pleasant hobby.

That's Skid Row... isn't it?

Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.

Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!

Yeah.

Carlotta?

Where?

Wandering.

By whom?

Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.

How soon can it be altered?

Excellent.

Don't touch her. Call 911.

Boyd brought up divorce statistics.

I don't have to...

And you're a little fucking reject.

You're a loser.

You fucking bastard!

What?

You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!

There's more.

According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.

I am not flexible on this.

We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.

I can't do this.

At the seven-eleven.

Adam! Calm down.

Don't eyeball your kids.

I don't think so.

I got you.

Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...

Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?

Where is she?

The groom?

Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?

Great. Fine. Perfect.

Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...

Left side.

Who's up for making some real money?

Shut up.

I'm calling the police.

I think we should say some words over the grave.

He's having a problem here.

He is not cracking up.

Exactly! Exactly my point.

You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.

I don't know...

Now?

Isn't it a little late?

I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.

Fine? Fine what?

True.

You have a King fantasy.

And what happens when you can't?

Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?

How about my Fatburger?

I do.

We missed the deadline.

I don't think so.

Sent it.

I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.

David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.

Who else?

Why? What's his problem?

It's vile!

I will.

I love you.

Not yet.

I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.

Well I do.

Nesting?

"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."

We're not canceling.

No.

It's too late.

She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.

But...

But...

You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.

If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.

I love you dad.

What does that mean?

You're not breathing right?

I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...

No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.

My God...

Yup.

Take your time. I wish I had.

Drum banging real times.

I don't think that's a good idea.

Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?

What about them?

No.

I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.

How could anybody behave like that?

Whatever you like.

I don't like masquerading, but as you see I decided to give in to your whim.

Go away! Leave me alone.

But what can I say to her, sir?

That's it.

The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.

Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...

No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.

One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?

Are you Jorge?

If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.

I'm not like you, you have your wife.

Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!

You are forgiven. Goodbye.

I have a headache.

Can you tell us what's on the disc?

Catch him and your record's clean.

Madison lives two blocks from their present location.

Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?

Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.

On my life, I promise you I will.

If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.

Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.

You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.

Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?

He hears...everything.

You're...such a wimp.

It feels so.. .real.

What's wrong with Parker?

I think I understand what you have in mind...

No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?

I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.

What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?

I'm still working on it.

Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.

Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.

I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.

Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...

This isn't a game, Parker!

You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?

Both.

I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.

Part of him is.

Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.

Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...

You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true, right?

I could tell you stories:  Cecil B. Demille:  Alright? The Greatest Show on Earth:  He needs an elephant,

They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.

Gonna be fine.  Gonna be fine, people?  Are we getting there...?

It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...

Come on.

Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>

John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....

Okay.  And she's alleging...?

All I need is the one day.

What in the <u>world</u> would do that?

Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...

We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.

Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.

In the yellow ribbon.

<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?

...take a long view.

Anything at the Airport?

A young Albanian Girl, dressed in their...

...but to the Old World; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of War which have, since I was a child...

<u>So</u> forth...

Yeah...what was I talking about...?

We're gonna do the <u>Team Song</u>.

...fourteen years...

...what have you <u>done</u> to me...

No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...

Oh.  Hell.  And what do we do now?  What do we do <u>now</u>? Boy Producer?  Mister Win-an-Emmy, Social Conscience, <u>Whaleshit</u>, save- the-rainforest, Liberal hire-a-convict <u>shithead</u>? Mister Affirmative-Action Peacnik.  Commie... <u>shithead</u>....?

Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...

THE GROUP WATCHING TELEVISION.

ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G.

Dashes and Dots.  And those dots spell out a message in the Morse Code. And that message is, "Courage, Mom..."  And he got the message through. "Courage.  Mom..."  Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>I</u> say "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn.  I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe."  Ladies and Gentleman, we will not <u>treat</u> him like an Old Shoe, we...

...we own it?

How's our friend?  What is he, "dead?"

Shoe, boy...?  You know, you were telling me you wanted Beans?  Remember, you were concerned about the Beans...?

N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?

I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.

I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?

This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.

Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...

And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."

Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...

Why Albania?

The... 

Is that true?

"Freedom."

No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?

Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?

President's speech.

It's not too <u>clean</u>...

Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...

What do you mean he won't do it?  He won't do <u>what</u>?  He won't do the sp...  It's what?  It's <u>corny</u>?  <u>Corny</u>?  Is that the word?  Of <u>course</u> it's corny.  We wouldn't have him <u>say</u> the flippin' thing it wasn't corny.  Put... listen, it's not a question, we're locked <u>in</u> to this speech.  NO We're, Are You Listening?  LOCKED IN.  We're, we're playing way <u>past</u> it, we're <u>past</u> it -- it's the set-up for...he has <u>got</u> to say the speech.  Tell Ames to meet me at the West Gate in... 

You do your job right, nobody should notice.

Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...

Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.

Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 

Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....

Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?

Finish Strong!  Are you <u>nuts</u>?  Are you nuts?  This's Pennies from <u>Heaven</u>... on his triumphal return home, Old Shoe, his Plane Forced Down...AND YET...

We'll deal with that when we come to it.  <u>This</u> is producing.  <u>This</u> is what they pay off on...come on, Pal, Boots and Saddles...

Ha ha.  No, no, not <u>now</u>, not <u>now</u>, of course, But Someday... when they tell <u>this</u> story...

He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...

"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."

Take ten.

It's too clean.

It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.

Keep Talking....

You got a guy, doesn't believe the War is... NO NO NO. An American Serviceman... A brave American Serviceman, is Left <u>Behind</u> ...  He is Left Behind.  He is discarded like an Old Shoe...  Gemme the Pentagon.  List of people in all Military Special Programs.... Left behind.  Like the Old Shoe... Johnny: "Good Old Shoe"... 

See y'at the Finish Line.

They look stupid.

...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.

Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?

Better.

Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...

By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.

...they have the capacity to Meld into the <u>Woods</u>, and...

...their Leopard Skin Berets....

No, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  Um... <u>Later</u>.

...for the beans, yes...

Cause the beans, y'know, y'can tell if they're <u>puttin</u> stuff in it.

That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...

Come on, you fucking sissy, you think this is tough? Try show-business.  1970-1990, n'ybody I worked with, y'could of bottled their piss n'sold it in the <u>ghettos</u>...  Come on, Pal...

Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...

They don't know what's going on!

Sounds like a french word, what is it?

...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.

Great Charlie, any better it'd be a sin.

...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up...

...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping Rock any day.

...gotta read my reports.

Get the hell out!

Start unloading.

D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.

50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...

It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 

Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.

No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.

That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.

You speak for me, son.

Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.

What are you doing here?

First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?

Stay here, I'll see what I can do.

...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.

Tell 'em your father gave it to you.

Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...

All right, Bud... let's do it.

...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...

He never told me...

Jackson, Steinem...

...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.

It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?

Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.

What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??

Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?

Allright. Wait here...

But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.

What does that mean?

Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...

A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.

Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.

...I can't make it tonight.

Oh yes, I remember you.

The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.

And what do you want?

Well, why stop at that?

I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.

You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...

I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.

What the hell's that supposed to mean?

...how do you know? You wish...

Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.

There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.

Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.

Now tell me, why would I want to do that?

I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.

Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.

So why are you dating Jonathan?

A body.  I mean we're talking major body

About what?  About us.

Hmm.

Thank you Jenkins

No?

A party at a waxwork huh?

I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.

No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.

That's not what you said last night.

Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.

Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.

Mom.

That's not true.

So much.

No.  But once I heard...

Mine.  His.  We both...thought...

Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?

I don't know, I'm very confused right now.

That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.

At the party.

Who's that?

Give me that shit.  Your wife.

It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--

Is everything alright?

Who?  Your husband?

That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.

Wait!  Don't go...

Very much.

No.  No, I don't.

Claire.

Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.

Stop.

Good.  I'm good.

So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?

Please.  That's all I need.

I don't...

I don't know.

M-E...

Did I?

Please.

I was down in Adamant...

Why?

You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.

What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?

We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.

Three o'clock.

No, no.  I'm just about...  There.

We did.

Mmm.

Tomorrow.

More or less.

To make sure she's all right.

Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.

Is it gone?

Did you call about the Feurs?

No.  Look!  In the window.

She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.

What am I looking at?

...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?

Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...

Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.

Well, that's a relief.

No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!

He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--

Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.

Claire, please...

Then where is she?

Are you glad?  I'm glad.

I felt you...looking through me...

You told me that I was...

In the living room...

But I don't remember.

Not personally.

...Please stop...

STOP IT!

We don't know that for sure.

Huh.

Don't think so.

Fine.  I'll do the shopping.

:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.

Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!

I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.

Two what...?

But why would they do that...?

But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.

Come.  There is a lot to read

Nothing was ever more false.

Every day  twice.

It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.

I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'

Hello...?  Who is this...?

Diedre Mayfair was your mother.

It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -

Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -

I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?

A Mayfair it ever I saw one.

Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.

Now, lasher - it is our time.

FAST.

Like this...?

I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...

I love Michael...

Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...

You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!

It was an accident.   Gifford, too.

They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...

Like this...  LIKE THIS...?

Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...

'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..

You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -

And whose houses do you design...?

You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.

What about you coming down here...?

Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?

He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!

Hello..

He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.

That's GREAT!

A little wine...?

Dropped it.

That's not funny.

Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.

What were you talking about...?

It's not true.  You have to believe me.

Just don't fall off any ladders.

Sut McKinley.  Marry me.

Is that a crack about our singing...?

As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?

I'm sorry - I didn't think

Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?

Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book

I think I will pass...

No she didn't...

You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 

I don't want to talk about it -

I don't know...

It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.

Tell me about your adopted MOTHER

Then make it stop...

I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...

He doesn't need to...

Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...

You killed my friend!

At home alone - where were you?

I think you had better leave

Surgery? Are you a doctor?

Yes...?

Yes - one please.

She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.

Poor Freud, turning in his grave.

Nobody knows about your mental retardation.

Astronomical.

Well, Dad said...

Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.

Perv.

I better go, Dad.

Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.

Dead?

It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.

Take a whiff of heaven.

Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.

Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.

This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.

We reinvented ourselves.

You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.

Jealousy is so unattractive.

SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.

Yeah? You like?

I do? I mean, yeah, I do.

We own a small family grocery store.

It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.

Well, why should I?

We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.

That's me.

Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.

What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.

What do you want me to do?

If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?

We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.

I understand.

I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?

So, what brings you here at his hour?

Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.

Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.

That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.

Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.

It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.

I'm trying to help.

"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.

Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.

I know.

In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.

Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...

My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.

I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.

You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.

I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.

You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.

Very ambitious. I like that.

No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.

What is all this? When are you coming home?

Only the best for my mother.

I'll make you very proud.

Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.

Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.

Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.

Rules are rules.

A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?

A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.

Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.

Of course I like girls.

Seldom? No kidding?

Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.

Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.

It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.

In other words, our scope is too narrow.

That's perfect.

You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.

I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?

I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.

That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.

Was there ever any kind of investigation...

Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.

Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.

No.

Suzie Toller is missing.

Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?

Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.

It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?

Unless what?

Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...

I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.

You don't think Sam could've put it there?

And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?

The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.

We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?

So you were alone.

What about witnesses?

Yeah... okay... he did

I'm sorry?

Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.

I would hardly say you look like trash.

I miss Dad.

No you don't.

I won't.

No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.

Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.

Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...

Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.

You think that's wise?

Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.

Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.

What's that supposed to mean?

Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.

Just like that?

Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.

I did.  At Blue Balls.

That's cop bullshit.

In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.

And she wanted to talk.

That's right.

Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.

Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.

Are you mad at me?

The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.

Can't.  Got a passenger.

What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...

I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?

Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.

Starting with a screw?

Prepare what?

Quite.  Come, let's mingle.

Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?

I'm going to hit you.

Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.

You really enjoy yourself, don't you?

Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!

You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?

Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.

I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?

Yes, me!

They don't even realize they should be frightened.

I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.

Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.

Nicely said, sir.

He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.

That would be... the Mexican War?

It's a smelting retort.

It is?

Right.

Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!

What is Tir Asleen?

No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!

My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.

Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!

No.  I mean yes.

Let me see it.

You're not a woman.

Say what?

Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.

As above, so below.

You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.

Are you okay?

These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...

Because she's sick.

I thought you had her!

Elora Danan!

Madmartigan!  You saved her life!

My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.

Well what did she say?

What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?

Want me to carry Elora?

No!

Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...

The limitless power of...

I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?

Shhhhh!

We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.

No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.

More!  More!

Why?

He never misses.

Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!

Ouch!  Let go of me!

I changed her already!

Who is that horrible friend of yours?

Who is he?

No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!

Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.

How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.

How are we going to get out there?

Not one this big.

Who'd you see?

...I want to say a thing.

Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!

Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.

Sure have, Sam.

Yeah.

Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight  street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.

Just us.

We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.

Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.

He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.

The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.

We do not go into your courts.

Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.

No, no doctor...

But you can't.

Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -

Hochmut?

Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.

A real fireball.

There was.

Where's my baggy pants?

Johnny, what the fuck?

Johnny! Where the hell have you been?

Say again?

He's got my number.

Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.

No...

I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.

Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.

He's from... Ohio... My cousin.

All right, where is he?

No... No. It is just the English way.

I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.

Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --

Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--

Oh -- all right.

Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.

Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.

Who are you?

I don't believe you!

I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!

Catch him, you fool!

Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.

No, I'm afraid I didn't.

You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.

Toto, too.

Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.

Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.

Has it poppies on the wall....

Oh, you....

Stop her!

Oh...

Well, you're perfect now.

Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.

Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?

Now come on - you're acting silly -- 

Lions and tigers and bears!

You're right -- I am a coward.

Hah!

It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!

In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....

Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!

Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.

Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.

No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.

Where's Kansas?

Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.

Oh --

Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?

Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.

I -- Oh --

Fine.  He's got a plan

She - she can have my Witch Remover.

Hold still - hold still --

Whozat?

Don't push!

Not nohow!

No, sir!

We do.

Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!

Dorothy!

Yes.

Here, Tin Man -- help me.

Oh - look out.

Go on!

This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!

Heres your imposter. Hes paid off the men on the plane outside.  Theyre not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, theyre flying it wherever he tells them.

Then its no longer a bomb?

Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...

Hes going to insert the plutonium.

Perhaps after this ... test?

Quite the opposite, in fact.

And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.

Im sorry.

Thats every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  Thats why youre here, isnt it? You think I cant do it. You think Im going to screw up. Or get myself killed.

I know.

I think youre one of the bravest people Ive ever met.

Two. Shaken not stirred.

Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?

He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.

How high up does this...arms dealing go?

Whats your business with Elektra King?

No!  Get me out!

Of course...

Its heading for the oil terminal.

I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.

What?!

The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.

Who is she?  Do you know her?

Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.

Collect me?

Jon, no -- I can't --

Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.

I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .

You're the only human being I care for.

You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.

Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.

What is it?  How does it work?

Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.

Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?

No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.

Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.

One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.

I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.

Memory lane.

-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.

What are you up to?

The costumes.  Am I right?

I think he's going to the john.

Will you two lovebirds keep it down?

Where did he go?

Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?

Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.

Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.

Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?

Coward.  Giving up.

Okay, let's just . . . thank you.

Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.

With lots of ketchup?

Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?

-- What?

Did you know he was back on the streets?

That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --

I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --

Jon??  You mean he's --

Laurie!  Good to see you.

No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.

Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.

Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.

Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.

You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.

I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.

What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.

Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.

That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.

My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...

Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?

But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.

You're a jerk-off, you know that?

They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.

We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.

That's exactly why we need them.

So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.

Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?

"Anarchy" 99"?

What weapons do you have?

Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.

Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.

Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.

I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.

The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.

We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.

What are you talking about?

If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.

There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.

I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.

Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.

When can I see you again?

I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.

We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.

It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.

We'll have to go after them.

A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.

If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.

It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?

That's would be me.

Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?

Here we go again.

Is this what you're looking for?

He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.

Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.

Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.

Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.

Beast.

We have to find Magneto.

Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.

What's that?

Into the Hudson?

I wanted to talk to you.

I won't light the cigars - how about that?

What if I like the pain?

Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.

By reading my thoughts?

He takes his work seriously.

I've seen a lot of rings.

I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.

Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.

What do you want?

You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.

Deal.

To find Rogue.

ALIVE.

Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.

It does indeed, Max.

No!

Yes, sir?

Baack!

Is it that music?

Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.

MMmmm.

Hello...?

Of course.

Yes.

Yes, don't worry.

I promise.

Oh, darling -- so will I.

Very....very!

You're incorrigible!

Goodbye, darling!

Darling!

I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.

Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.

But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.

Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.

Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??

Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.

Yes!... the laboratory.

This is the only library I know of.

I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.

The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.

My father was a sick man.

No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.

You must be Igor.

Why are you talking like that?

I wonder what's got into them?

Just putting up some tea.

Must be the music room.

Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.

Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!

What?

Well, I don't like to see you mope.

careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.

You can say that again.

... I'm glad that's...

Act casual!

How do you know it was a 'she'?

That's what we're paid for.

MMMMMmmmmmmm.

...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................

Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.

Well, this explains the music.

Yes!

I thought it was wonderful.

I think I'll...carry him.

I know Frederick.

It wouldn't be fair to her.

Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.

His schwanzstucker.

Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?

Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?

Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.

One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!

Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.

Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.

They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.

If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"

Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.

I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.

And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
