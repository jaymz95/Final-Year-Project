Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?

Cameron.

Seems like she could get a date easy enough...

That's because it's such a nice one.

I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?

Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.

Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.

Let's go.

Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?

My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.

You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --

What's normal?

So did you

You set me up.

Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.

And where're you going?

Otherwise known as an orgy?

Daddy, no!

The prom?  Kat has a date?

Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.

Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.

Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada

Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -

No, I ' m not.

Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.

Yeah -- we'll see.

It's off. The whole thing.

She's partial to Joey, not me

And why would I do that?

Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.

But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?

You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?

Fine, thirty.

Fifty, and you've got your man.

Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.

We don't chat.

You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.

That's never been proven

Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway

Who?

You -- covered in my vomit.

I told you

Sure, I do

Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.

See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?

I hate him.

What?

Busy

BIANCA

Maybe.

You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.

You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?

It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?

Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?

Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.

Just smack her now.

Hi.

Yeah.  I guess.

Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.

So Dorsey can get the girl?

We're your guys.

Just for now.

Yeah.

No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.

It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.

Touch of the flu.

See you next week!

Make anyone cry today?

Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.

Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.

Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.

Is that all that interests you? Gold?

The Judgment is ours!

Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.

What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...

I don't want you to wait for me.

Yes... I remember...

Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!

There must be a passage to that other ocean.

I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.

He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.

Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?

Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.

Thousands.

Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.

With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.

Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.

I'll try to remember that, Marchena...

Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?

I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.

Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?

They come and go as naked as the day God created them...

The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.

Come over here.

He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.

You think I don't know that?

Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!

We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.

You bring the cigarettes?

No, he is here.  Shit...

Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.

Somewhere else?

Yes, I considered it.

I still can't believe Eddie's gone.

Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?

No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.

Pouring it out!

...Do you really want me to forget about you?

What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.

End my career?

Yeah, right.

Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.

Yeah.

What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.

Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.

We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.

Do you have any Czech girls working for you?

No, what is it?

Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.

Pretty.

Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.

Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?

Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?

There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.

This isn't homicide school.

Of course.

I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.

You wanna talk to her alone?

What would your girlfriend think of that?

What's your accomplishment.

Then do it, asshole.

If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.

I really can't give out any information right now at this point.

Yeah.  Now's not a good time.

Alright?

Alright.

Could be Leon's.

Answer it.

That's good.

What?  It doesn't work that way.

My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.

Two weeks holiday.

I'd like to speak for himself, okay?

Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!

Shut up.

What does it look like?  It's an address book!

The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.

Bad last moment - I cut it out.

No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!

Milos.  Get my money!

I want to hear everything he said.

What are you coming here to do?

Thanks.  Appreciate it.

Evidence.  Of a homicide.

I used an accelerant.

You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?

How long they been livin' here?

What the hell happened?

Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.

Your doctor?

Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.

I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.

We're trying to get there. I hope we can.

Sure, what is it?

Yes?

Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.

I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.

I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.

He's got a point.

What is it, Hal?

Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.

Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?

I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.

Yes, it is.

It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.

Did they have any explanation for this?

Yes, Daddy.

Thank you.

Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.

No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.

I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.

Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.

Well, I'm glad about that.

How can you tell it was deliberately buried?

Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?

I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?

No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.

Thank you very much, Hal.

Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.

How about chargin' the battery?

Great, just great.

No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.

Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...

I ain't tired yet.

Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...

I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.

I don't think you're gonna make it.

Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....

I'm helpin' you, huh?

I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.

Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.

Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...

Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.

It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.

Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?

I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.

I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.

You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.

Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.

How much?

I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.

Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.

You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.

So you took the rest of the night off...

Whatever play I maker just back me up.

Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.

You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.

Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.

Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.

I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.

They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.

Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.

Hey ... Dick Tracy.

Here's the file. Cates checks the file.

So do you...been a long day.

I'm heading out. How about you?

I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?

You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.

You're hopeless.

I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.

I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.

Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.

Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.

What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?

You sure you want me to?

I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...

Yeah, one of my favorites.

No, it's I'm just surprised you called.

Hi, it's me...

Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...

Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.

What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.

Tell me.

Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.

How would you know?

In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?

What do you want?

I don't know what you're talkin' about.

I can't get it until Monday. Honest.

You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.

First, the money.

This ain't a credit business.

I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.

I'm fucked!

I remember you now..the so called art dealer.

No thank you.

They are robots!

Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.

You noticed...

I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?

It means, "Never without my permission".

What kind of mission?

Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.

Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!

That's what I'm saying.

One more reason to shoot first eh?

Perfect.

Don't exist bud.

How do I look?

It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.

You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.

Vito Cornelius?

I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...

...Leeloo.

When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.

You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!

...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!

I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?

Have you pulled yourself together?

You little sleaze bag!

This is a police control action..

Yeah, very big, a giant.

Not without Leeloo.

I'll be right back.

Old tricks are the best tricks eh?

What is... Make Love?

Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.

And you can't concentrate with me around?.

I want to sleep... forever...

Been here long?

Uh..

Actually only one cell survived..

It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.

Yes... I can't wait to meet him.

How much time is left?

"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."

Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.

Well, I'm not smoking, okay?

I love you.

Sure.  I'll call the guy.

I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?

I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...

Don't...

Mrs. Christian.

Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.

The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...

I promised him to Machine.

Is it?

Brooklyn.  Don't be late.

Where are the women?

Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?

Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...

Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.

Move it, dirtbag... !

Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?

I'm not so sure about this.

I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...

I know what you did.

I know what you did.

You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...

You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.

Something like that.

Show me.

Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?

Stop talking.

That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.

I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?

Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.

I was well compensated.

Shut up.

You'll get it when we get there.

Yeah... guess so.

Pardon me?

I'll risk it.

Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.

I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.

Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.

Good for you.

Three, four years.

What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?

I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?

I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?

So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?

Specialty product.

Where does he sell it?

Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?

"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.

He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...

Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.

Do you want to tell me what you found?

No.

I told you I can't, not yet.

No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...

You're joking.

Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...

Neil... Neil Cole.

No.

Okay.

There wasn't one.  The police looked.

Yes.

Who are you?

Those are her belongings.

That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.

She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?

Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.

But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.

What's wrong?

What?

I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...

Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.

Yeah, I'm not so sure.

Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.

Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...

You're his sister, right?

Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.

The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.

Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.

Earth to Alice...

Let me talk to you.

It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.

Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.

It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.

Don't worry, honey

What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...

Been having bad dreams.

He's inside you, where he hides.

No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.

Since my little girl became a mom...

Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.

I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.

Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.

If they actually bothered to bury her.

That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.

But I've seen her grave.

She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.

You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?

Yeah...

I can't listen to this.

It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.

You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?

You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?

I'd sooner swim!

But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!

Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!

A lot of people think like that.

Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!

What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!

The sound again?

I'm with <u>you!</u>

What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?

I...don't know!

The frogmen?

Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.

Wonderful!

If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....

What direction does the system indicate?

Huh?

Take a look.

Thirty-four seconds!

Minus three.

All right - go to it.

Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.

Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.

Has anybody offered to buy it?

What is the Northcountry Development Association?

Twombley involved?

Same old shit.

Yeah. I know about that.

Tell me.

Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.

Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.

You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.

You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.

Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.

You played for the Sox?

Hmm.

What happened?

Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.

How'd you get the job?

Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.

A half mile in, along the old lumber road.

Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?

What are you talking about?

It's stupid.

No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.

I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.

Yes.

I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.

Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --

Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.

I want to go home.

Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.

I'm not saying that.

Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.

You want me to follow them to Littleton?

It ain't done, if that's what you mean.

You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?

Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.

Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.

Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.

Yeah, lots.

I know who it is.

For a while.

See you tomorrow, maybe.

Tonight. Let's get together.

I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.

Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?

But not now.

I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.

There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.

It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?

The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.

It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.

There's a furnace.

When did she die?

Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.

I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?

Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.

A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!

Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.

You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.

Wade?

Twombley.

They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.

What happened?

What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?

No thanks. I don't drink.

Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.

Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?

I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.

That it wasn't an accident.

A hunting accident is perfect.

Not particularly.

So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.

Hey, you guys back already?

Alice... I...

Been better, Dad... You?

It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.

Okay, I'm slowing us down.

Did we warn them off?

Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.

Stay cool.

Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.

To swear you in as President.

My loyalty was never to my country.

Ga get it.

Where are we now?

No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.

Tower, here.

You will be the first to pay for that mistake.

Jim...

Over my dead body.

Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!

You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.

Gravity.

That isn't necessary.

And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?

Please... don't start with me.

They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.

We're handling it, sir.

But...

You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.

I might still have a few chips left.

This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.

Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?

DO YOU SEE TEEM?

We're hooked. Hove into position.

I was reading too.

You better check it, Unger.

Sir?

Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.

And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.

Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.

Ted!

Ted, please be careful.

Not now, Elaine.

Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.

That's right -- premature ejection.

Simon.

Don't be too long.

He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.

I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?

Negative.

Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...

Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.

There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.

I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.

I don't want to hear that word!

What?

You're sure?

All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.

Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?

Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.

Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.

You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.

Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.

Then Elaine was right.

I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.

I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.

We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.

Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.

I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.

Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.

Yes. Yes, of course.

No.

Headquarters!? What is it?

Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

Yes?

Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.

Uh-huh.

Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.

Yes, Captain?

Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.

Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.

What is it?

Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.

Okay, this is one of my favorites.

Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?

Of course.

Would you go up, please?

Yeah...

The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.

I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.

You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.

No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...

My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.

The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--

Yes.

Nothing.

A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?

And that fits?

And still it fits?

Did you learn anything?

Aw-right.  What about the other guy?

From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.

Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.

Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.

When will Strader return?

In the other man's rectum.

Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.

Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?

George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?

To the... to the beach?

Why?

Thank you.

Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.

Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.

Do what?!  George-- ?!

... It's Harcourt.

You look very good.

Only holds five.

Who else can I ask around here?

Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?

Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.

Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.

Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.

Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...

Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...

Talk to me, Hudson.

Let's go.  Pull 'em out.

Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.

I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.

What?

You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?

Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?

What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?

Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.

Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.

They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?

Bullshit!

But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --

You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.

Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.

Sorry to disappoint you.

Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.

So...then the fusion containment shuts down.

Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?

Alive?

Sure, Hicks.

Aye-firmative.

I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?

I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.

Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.

We didn't miss anything.

Stand back.

No.  Have you?

Fuck you.

Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.

Uh, what's next?

Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.

Terrible.

How long have I been on Gateway station?

What about me?

And hope to die?

I don't want to...I have scary dreams.

Did you ever have a baby?

Where is she?

I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.

Yes, honey.  I think we both can.

It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.

Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...

His Grace is very angry with you.

Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.

In a harem.

My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.

You might be disappointed.

Sir -

Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.

Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?

I want to go!

Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.

What?

Oh yes? You always know everything.

Don't be stupid.

Stanzi!

These gentlemen are from Salzburg.

I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?

Oh, Stanzi.

Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!

You'd think I was mad.

Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.

It's killing me.

Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.

What do you mean?

But! I'm a married woman!

He needs me, ma'am.

Leave him alone!

Money! Money!

But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!

I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.

I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.

Gertrude!

People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.

Ah, now! Here she comes.

You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.

It's just a trifle, of course.

Ah-ha!

Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?

Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.

Yes?

Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?

Enchanted, Madame.

What is it?

Yes, Sire.

Who told you this, Majesty?

Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.

Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.

You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.

In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.

How is your financial situation?

It's a secret.

Why didn't you mention it in your letters?

No one calls you that.

I will, sir.

I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!

I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.

Are you Herr Mozart?

They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.

Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.

German!

No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.

Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?

Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!

Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?

If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.

Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.

But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!

It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.

Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!

Oh, Excellency, would you?

Thank you! Oh, thank you.

I think it's marvelous. Truly.

What work?

Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.

Do you mean that?

No! No, it's him!

Of course.

The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.

What time?

Yes.

I think so.

Yes.

First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?

I think so.

You go fast!

But, Your Majesty -

Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.

Because His Majesty wishes it.

Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.

You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?

Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.

I know a little. I studied it in my youth.

I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?

God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.

I did.

What difference does that make?

No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!

Yes?

Exactly.

Yes.

Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.

Who is she?

Yes, I am looking after him.

Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.

What do you mean, 'how did he look'?

Yes, Doctor?

No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.

Has his friend appeared to him again?

Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.

Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.

The zoo? Is he rational?

Tea would be nice.

What?

Please, really. I'm not hungry.

How is that?

Right.

I thought you were asleep.

Was Jack Goodman your good friend?

I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.

Will you come with me?

Will you think about it?

Not just a patient -- me.

I'll let you know the next full moon.

Your dead friend Jack?

Lovely.

That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.

Werewolves simply do not exist.

Okay.

See you later.

I should be committed.

I swear, I don't know this girl.

Will you shut up!?!!

David, don't lose control.

Why on earth do you say that?

Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.

This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.

You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.

No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.

What time is it?

Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.

Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.

Did you see Jack?

Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.

She's a jerk.

It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.

We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?

Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?

It's a five-pointed star.

Come on, I'm freezing.

Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.

Plan?

No.

Are you going to help me up?

Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?

Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.

Rudy Levine the shmuck?

I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.

Stop it, Jack.

Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.

David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...

What do you think?

You must believe me.

Hello.

Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?

Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.

Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.

Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.

No.

I beg your pardon?

You here again? What do you want?

Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?

I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.

Yes - sure

I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.

No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.

Here's twenty-five thousand.

Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.

Yes, sir.

We've been waiting fifteen minutes

Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!

I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.

Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .

Line?

Well

Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.

Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.

I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!

Yes, sir.

Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.

Got a handkerchief?

Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.

Well . . .

Tomorrow night?

Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .

Why, I don't know.

I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?

There you are.

Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?

Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson

Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.

What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.

Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.

All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.

Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.

Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.

Oh, is that so?

Well, he was making love to her.

Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.

Mr. Williams . . .

Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!

Yes, sir.

There you are!

Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.

Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.

Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...

Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.

What?

As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.

Leave me alone, Bob.

Swear.

Best damn plan I heard all war.

Tell me.

I could use the walk.

You're not scared, are you?

She was European!

After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?

It was exciting.

I got three.

Twenty?!

And I'm the better outlaw.

A trap.

Missed you too, cousin.

We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.

Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...

Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.

Shakespeare.  He's European.

Get buckets!

Strategically.

Of course!  Uh, sir?

The District Marshall

What is it?

Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.

Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.

Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?

So we got a plan?

I reckoned.

All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.

Maybe, maybe...

What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.

Ma.

And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?

Jesse, we're outlaws.

Maybe it started out that way. But now...

I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.

We're just fine, thank you, sir.

Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.

Shush.

Mmmm.

Nuh-huh ...

No! I mean, of course not. No.

Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?

And what's this right girl like?

Sparkling rocks?

Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?

Me neither.

She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.

She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.

"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.

Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.

The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.

Thanks.

Right here in church?

You been with a girl ever?

I hope I'm not being too forward.

Lyla Devereux.

They had to be dealt with!

Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.

Yes sir.

I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.

I look forward to seeing it.

What, sir?

I remember you.

Oh, that's the best part.

Courtney? Dinner?

I'm thinking Dorsia.

The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.

Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?

Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.

Yes, dear.

Is it a what?

Turn the light on.

Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.

You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.

Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.

No-I can't take the time off work.

I don't want to talk about it.

Hi. Pat Bateman.

No. I'm not. Why should I ?

Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?

Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?

Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?

Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"

There was no ad in the Times.

Yes, naturally.

Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.

It's just not.

Lucky, I guess.

No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.

It looks that way, doesn't it?

Maybe it's just the light.

New card. What do you think?

But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.

Leaving what?

I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!

Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?

Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.

Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?

I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?

Detective Donald KIMBALL?

Can you bring Mr...

Yes, Patrick?

I'm on a diet. But thank you.

No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.

No, not really.

Hmmmm.

I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?

Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.

Uh huh?

Patrick, you re a lunatic.

Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.

You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?

Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.

No, I'm okay.

Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-

He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.

I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.

Well, maybe he did, huh?

Hmmm.

Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-

It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...

Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?

Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?

God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.

Wait. That's not what I've got.

Let's see...  That you were with-

Not in the mood, I guess.

I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?

Where was Marcus?

I'm hungry

I'm hungry.

You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.

It's...it's...all right.

Oh well, you know.

Cecelia is, well...you know 

Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?

No, Owen.

Some guys are just born cool, I guess.

They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.

C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.

Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?

Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?

Nothing.

Poor baby. You know that's not true.

...Different?

Milo --

I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.

No.

Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.

It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...

I am. I am, sir.

Yes sir.

'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?

What'd they ever do for you?

You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.

Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.

And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.

I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.

There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.

It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?

I do!

Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.

Definitely.

Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.

The wrong place?

'Have a look?

...Worse?

Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.

'Sorry about the late notice...

I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.

Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --

Just do it.

He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?

Got out of my other commitment.

Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?

They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.

You're famous around here.

No. Please.

"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?

Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?

You're compulsive.

Then and now.  But not right now.

But why would they --?

There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.

'Cause their apartments might be bugged?

He doesn't know about the Day Care.

That's lame, isn't it?

Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!

What?

Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!

His Snapples were in alphabetical order.

#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.

Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --

Groovy.

Sak-i it to me!

That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?

Kiss me.

I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'

We know all that, Exposition.

Good luck, Austin.

Oh, and Austin...

Thank you, Exposition.

Oh, and Austin...

Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.

What's the other?

What's the other thing you're scared of?

Well, you can't always get what you want.

Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.

Why not? It's a question.

Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.

Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.

What?

I'm sure.

Here, use mine.

Do you want to talk to him?

Let me see.

How do you know?

He's too well-protected right now.

You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.

I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.

No, this is me in a nutshell.

It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.

Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.

Only sailors use condoms, man.

It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.

Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.

I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.

Indeed.

We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.

Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.

Likewise.

That's not mine.

I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.

Sure.

Here, have a piece of gum.

Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.

Where did you learn to shoot?

In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.

That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!

Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!

Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.

My son?

They're mutated sea bass.

We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.

Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.

I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.

I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.

Great.

You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.

... love ...

Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...

Impossible?

Really -- what happened in 1922?

We have met ...

Rules are made to be broken.

Quite frankly ... it could have been you.

To find out who killed my husband.

Next assignment?

Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...

But I found you. All the clues led me here ...

Valentine, listen to me ...

1922. Why the kippers?

We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.

A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?

Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.

Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.

I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.

Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.

How on earth can you tell?

Very good, Steed ...

Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?

... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...

Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.

Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...

Barely.

Mrs. Peel ... ?

The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...

I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...

Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --

Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.

You first.

You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.

What kept you?

Have you any place in mind?

Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...

I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?

You're saying I have no choice.

Decontamination -- ?

Well, I can't possibly go like this.

Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.

How did you guess?

It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.

Anyone particular in mind?

Where?

Walk over to the window ...

You wish.

Really -- you went with him for two years.

Deb, I want to throw you a shower.

Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.

Rick's got an important announcement to make.

Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.

We're going for a little liquid refreshment.

What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?

When do the girls get to the party?

Bond... James Bond.

What is this person's story here?

Oh, come on, just a little.

The car for Debbie?

Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.

Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.

Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.

You're going to have a bachelor party?

It looks awful.

Are you going to have women at your party?

Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.

Gonna get married...

You don't believe me? Okay, fine.

Let's get naked.

You're so romantic...

Great, Mom.

Quiet, Mother.

What are you talking about, asshole?

They left an hour ago, pink nuts.

What are you...

Gary, you're quite an animal.

All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.

Because I love her. What can I tell you?

What's going on?

Screw that.

You're a pimp?

Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.

That's it.

Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.

Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.

All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."

No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.

Yeah, I guess so.

What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.

Rick!

No sob story is going to change my mind.

Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.

She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.

My gift to you.

So long, Father.

I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.

About what?

I don't know.

I'm saved. Let's party!

Be gentle.

No.  I need a drink.

Yeah...

-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.

-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --

It's comin' along... want a beer?

It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.

I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?

So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?

I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.

What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.

You got a problem with drilling, probie?

Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?

...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?

What are we going to do about this?

We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.

Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.

C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.

Well, you did invite me here.

Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?

Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.

Leave Stephen out of this --

Hi.

Your boss is lying, Jennifer.

Just take it.

I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.

Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.

Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.

Pest control.

What are you listening to?

What reason?

That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?

Yeah? Airtight?

I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.

Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.

And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.

No need to be modest, Brian.

Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.

"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."

Management were pin heads.

I was ahead of my time.

Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?

You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?

I'll be there.

Here we go...

-- You remember.

Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.

Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...

Putty? On both doors?

Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.

What the hell was it doing in the fire?

I know you.

Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...

Investigator...

Nah...

You mean you could use it.

Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.

Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.

That's my problem. Just put in my bet.

I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.

You've really got a problem.

I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.

I'm on it.

...that simpleton is holding back the race.  They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?

Yeah!

My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.

And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?

I'm a revolutionary.

Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.

Must be the pressure.

Look at my lips.

Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.

Manray needs a job.

My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.

And I'm the feet.

We're starving.

EUREKA!!

Some tap dancing, some singing.

To what?

Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.

Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.

Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.

Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?

So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?

I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.

Go on.  Good so far.

Exactly!

Who are the other characters?

I don't know about that plantation angle.

We think so.

I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.

They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.

I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.

It's me, Peerless.

Pleased to meet you.

Daddy, she's younger than me.

How did you end up here?

I didn't mean that, in life.

Not that often.  He was excited to see you.

I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.

The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?

The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.

Good.  I'm going to need your support.

And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.

I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.

Which one is your brother?

Break a leg.

C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.

A gift.

No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.

I thought it was appropiate.

I don't want to hear it.

He's just playing big brother.

That's why it will be so much fun.

I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.

Give me the gun.

I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.

David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.

I feel fine.

You sound like the media.

Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.

No.

It looks delicious.

If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.

I can't go all the way down south.

Soon.

You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?

My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?

Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?

First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.

Thank you.  And always smile.

I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.

I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.

Tavis, thank you for having me.

She hates dem.

I thought you got rid of...

...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...

I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.

...too early...

You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.

Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?

Gots no intention of ending up broke.

Maybe I need to do a lot of things.

I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.

Y'know what?

Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?

This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.

The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.

It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.

Only a very little, as soldiers do.

I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.

And his baggage?

And so I am.

Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?

I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.

Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.

But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.

A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.

Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.

I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.

No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.

Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.

To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.

It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.

By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.

It is my only object.

I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.

My husband has convinced me of the contrary.

Old fool!

I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?

Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.

As much as possible.

All right, five hundred guineas.

In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.

I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.

Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?

Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?

Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.

Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?

If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.

Will he wish to know the details of this night?

It's ten thirty in the morning.

Who?

It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!

Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --

Shut up, Mueller.

I asked for a policeman.

C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.

They're dead, aren't they?

Okay.

Tell me about them.

That son of a bitch.

I didn't shoot West --

They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.

But not Pike's.

Do what?

Your weapons, Sergeant.

Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --

So did we. Why didn't you come?

I...

I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?

That's exactly what he says about you.

That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.

What don't you know?

You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.

Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.

Mr. Hardy?

How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.

My heart weeps.

No. I said Dunbar.

Because I was standing next to him.

I didn't --

Maybe --

Maybe he...

It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.

Well, he's a good soldier.

I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?

That's horseshit and you know it.

The Senator...

You're drunk --

I wanted to see if he was okay --

I'm not even going to dignify that --

Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?

You knew Sergeant West?

You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.

Yes.

Why?

Good cop/bad cop?

I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --

Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.

Got it.

I lied. Wait for it...

I don't think that has anything to do with --

I don't know.

You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.

That bugs you too?

Let's go talk to Bill...

They got their stories straight.

Yeah.

Hardy, for Chrissakes --

Seven.

Really.

Nobody saw. But I don't think so.

Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.

Think it'll work?

I should probably write that down.

What are you talking about?

Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --

"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.

What?

I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --

What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --

What the fuck are you doing?

Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?

We're not going anywhere.

-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --

Yeah.

No --

It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.

That's great.

Who is she? Where does she live?

Yes.

No one's ever left.

I brought it.

Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.

Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.

A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.

What did she look like?

You're pretty good at arithmetic.

I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.

Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.

I know.

I was dreaming.

I never knew.

You were talking about your wedding.

Make him stop.

Am I?

Okay.

Really.

You mean, while I'm here.

I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.

Dad?

Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."

You think I'm fake.

It would kill you, huh?

Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.

Story of my life.

Yes. Exactly.

I have the rest of my life to find out.

I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.

Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.

Yes.

I'll help you.

You don't have to.

They met at Auburn.

Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.

He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.

Yes?

Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.

I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.

Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.

What do you mean?

Do you want to stop?

It's nothing. I burnt myself.

It is. I did it cooking.

You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.

Right.

What are you doing here?

Oh.  We are Russian.

And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.

Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.

I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.

You're asking for my documents?

No. It's not that.

I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.

Fine. I thought you were leaving today.

You can stay tonight.

I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...

It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.

Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.

No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?

I don't have any money.

I don't want to talk about him.

But, you know, so what?

Why not?

You don't want to talk about it.

So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..

You...

So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?

She's dead.

You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.

Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.

Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.

This gonna get you in trouble?

I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.

Can I come in?

Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.

You gonna miss your bus.

She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?

I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...

I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...

It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.

Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.

If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...

BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.

Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.

Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.

I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...

Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?

In my house, you watch that lip...

Or what?

Uh-uh.

Uh-uh.

The... chain helps.

I tried.

By myself?

Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.

I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.

Maybe I won't.

Don't know if God wanna see me.

He's fine. Just had a bad fall.

Ain't gonna be moved?

I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.

Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.

One thing at a time, Laz.

Ask the chef.

I do.

Yes'sir.

Yeah, I know.

Yeah, I do.

Ronnie...

The hell are you talkin' about?

Thought you had a man for that.

The hell you call me?

Get rid of it.

It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.

-- I should tear your head off.

-- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.

Number five with a bullet.

I didn't know.

Nick, we can't just --

I don't think he'd feel it.

He couldn't find his ass with both hands.

Pussy, ass, soft personnel.

High spirits, desire, commitment.

The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.

Give us a break...

Leave the rice cake outside and go home!

I don't, that's all.

Why weren't you at the platform?

Sure.

Good.  Very good...

I want to yank Kobo.

Big enough.

For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.

No.

I followed them.  An hour from the train station.

Yes...

We can't lose.

I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.

Maybe I'm a quicker learner.

Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.

No one's keeping him here.

Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.

Not in that company.

It is not allowed.

Why don't you ask your chief detective?

Look.

If anything happens to her while I'm here --

I have to get to Sugai.

I want him.

The families who control the casinos?

I'll pay you.

Not to be trapped.

It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.

Can the maker repair what he makes?

Come here.

Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.

Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.

Like what?

Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.

Tomorrow, he says.

Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?

Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.

Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.

What was the cover on the one that got Holden?

Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!

This is Bryant.  Are you alone?

Soon as I finish the job.

My pleasure.

I like you too.

I don't know.

Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

No.  I got a problem.

Never been more sure of anything in my life.

Of course.

Do you recognize any of them?

What did she want?

You talking about the Opera House on the Main?

I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...

A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.

Of course not.

Why should I be?

You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.

Ugh.

Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.

I work alone.

Can you?  I couldn't.

You did?

If they are smart, they take naps.

Yeah.

What?

I never felt better.

What?

Discreetly.

How do you know I'm not?

Don't move.

Of course.

You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.

I don't have one.

I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.

I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?

You're all so perfect.

You like it?

Young man, stop right there!

I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?

Oh, brother...

Are you French?

Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.

Why doesn't that surprise me?

I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?

Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?

Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!

Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!

I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!

Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.

Can't you please just talk to me for one second?

Why doesn't it never work out?

Sorry.

It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.

No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.

Name it.

No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?

You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!

Sure.

Sorry!

Good for you.

He's gone to check your answers on his computer.

Okay!

Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"

Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...

Not that one!

Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?

Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!

Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.

Maybe. But that's how it works.

Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.

I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!

Eve, I'm sorry.

What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!

Goodnight!

Thanks.

Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.

...All right, Eve.  If you say so.

What?

Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.

Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!

Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.

It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.

It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.

Then why go there?

Yes, sir.  Is that all?

I'll try.

Uh, I think they have.

I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?

Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.

And it's called...?

Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.

Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?

Sorry, that's the largest city.

Yeah.

You don't have a computer in your cabin?

Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?

No.

Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.

Ladies first, Troy! That was close.

I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.

Yeah...Seems to.

Of what?

My father is a genius.

Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.

Just look!!

Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.

Hi.

I was thinking of selling all the cards.

I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.

Oh, you got a problem with that?

Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.

I'll go up.

I just hope this is still good up there.

Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.

He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.

What about relatives?

The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.

What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!

Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.

Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.

We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?

Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--

I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.

Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!

To go up.

No.

All our friends...

I'm not hungry.

What?

Honey?

What shall we call him?

If I...you know...

Right here!

What?

Coming!

You bet.

Yeah. Let's dig in!

It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".

Amen.

Your stuff?  Let me see that.

I guess we shouldn't fight in here.

Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.

Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.

I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.

No.

We did not leave together.

Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.

He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!

He left with Sophie.

What?!

Have him committed.

Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?

I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.

You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?

Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.

EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.

Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.

It must be great.

Yes.

Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.

Only you and the photo lab.

Yes sir. I sure am.

Yes sir.

Pest control, gotta do your apartment.

I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.

See my nipples?

No, please. I won't.

Yes, I like you.

What?

Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?

Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.

Hello.

Frank is coming?

What if Frank came over here and found us?

Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.

I promise, Dorothy. I promise.

'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.

No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.

He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.

Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.

Those are my breasts.

He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.

Okay Frank.

Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?

For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.

Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?

Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?

I'll get a coat for her.

I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.

I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.

Yes.

No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.

Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.

Where are they?

Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?

I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.

Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.

Alright.

Alright. Good luck, yourself.

Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?

I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?

I'll drink to that.

Why not?

He got a little jealous.

No way. I'm about to blow up.

Yes.

Yeah. I mean a little, you know.

That doesn't bother you, does it?

I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?

Goodnight.

I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.

Go ahead!

Yeah, nice meetin' you.

You can change it if you want to.

Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.

Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.

Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.

Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.

Any tips on where these guys may be?

Where's your gun?

Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.

Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.

Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.

Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!

Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.

Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.

I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.

Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.

I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?

Be careful.

Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.

He got beat up by a girl.

Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?

For what?

What?

What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.

Yes, we are.

Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.

And he is one smart man.

And we will send you to whatever God you wish.

Rule of thumb?

Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.

Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.

Really want to know?

New hitman wants to leave his mark

The Sicilians.

Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.

It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!

Witness?

I...

Yeah. Anybody call for me?

Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.

Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?

Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen.

God have mercy on my soul.

What do you want me to say?

Fuck you Vincenzo.

See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --

Yeah, I heard that.

You think we're going to be chased?

Nothing. Go ahead.

No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.

Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.

What do you think?

Dignan, those aren't running shoes.

You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.

It's not a plan. It's just --

Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.

Don't worry about it, Bob.

This was in fourth grade.

After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.

Yes... It's true.

Where was it parked?

If you say so.

I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.

What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.

I don't know, Dignan. I just --

You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --

How much?

Ah. Couple days ago.

Right. Freezers. Imported foods.

What the fuck are we doing out here?

Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.

Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.

Hang on a second.

Take your second position.

Any activity?

I'll get him.

Yes, there is. Let's get organized.

What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.

Dignan, I --

Yes, he did.

Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?

Yeah. He said that.

OK, Dad.

And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?

Is that OK?

Jesus Christ! No.

Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.

I didn't do anything.

Who's got the car keys?

Cuba.

You're Anthony?

Abdul-Shabazz?

What do you mean?

The front stairs.

Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.

What's he doing here?

It seemed like a good idea at the time.

I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?

I thought your parents were in Italy.

So who's going to know?

It's true, Dignan.

You're paranoid, Bob.

God DAMMIT.

He electrocuted someone?

No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.

He wouldn't move.

It's registered in my mother's name.

You're the one who kept saying ram him.

See you in a little while.

They also found my two beam scale in the garage.

The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.

I don't know.

Well, obviously, we got to go back.

Let's go.

Yeah. It is.

Man, I don't want to go into this.

Look. We want you on the job.

Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?

We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.

John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.

I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?

Well, I think --

You Hoto?

I want to know about Treadstone.

What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.

Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?

Do you know what his budget was?

I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.

Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.

Don't you want answers?

I'm sorry, Ward.

'Why' would be enough for me.

And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.

Thanks.

I speak English.

How... how can... how can you be here and say this?

Sorry. Old habits.

I don't know.

-- take the back -- get another car --

But it ends up the same.

We pushed it. We got lazy.

No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 

Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --

-- where? -

Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.

Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --

No. You never worked Berlin.

Your first assignment was Geneva.

I want someone I know to take me in.

There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.

Careful...

I'm working on it.

What?

That's where we came out.

For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.

Me? Four years.

Yes, sir -- ma'am...

Before this? Before Bourne? No.

You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.

You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.

What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.

So?

By who?

We must sue for peace.

We cannot defeat this --

It is suicide.

You've all sworn to Longshanks.

So let the council swear publicly.

He has already agreed to come.

I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.

You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.

...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --

Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.

You mock us with a smile?

Fourteen? --

I rest.

Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.

No. One of us is enough.

Aye, we'll get 'em.

The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.

He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.

He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.

Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.

He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.

Let her speak.

You scare me.

This night is too beautiful to have again.

...Tonight!

And I with you. But you must wake.

...I wouldn't know.

Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.

Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.

Every man dies. Not every man really lives.

It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.

And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?

I am trying.

I must... consult with my father.

Exactly.

No English lord would trust an Irishman!

Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.

I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --

What is it?

Honey. What were you doing with that?

Cute, Evan.

You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.

Can you protect me?

I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.

No, protecting her.

Where are my goddamn books?

Damn. Your dad did this?

You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.

Those are your clothes, silly.

Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.

I walk differently?

I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.

You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.

Why's that?

Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?

Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?

Which is?

He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.

It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.

Been there, done that.

I won't let you down, Professor Carter.

Thumper had a busy afternoon.

It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.

Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.

Y... yes. I guess I did.

What happened?? Where are we?!

It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.

Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.

You're such a retard!

Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.

Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.

Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.

-- Will he keep his word?

Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.

In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.

But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...

How long can I afford to stay closed?

Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.

-- Tonight he forgot.

Yes, sir.

-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.

It shall not happen again, Monsieur.

It's not for sale.

Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.

It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.

-- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.

Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?

Yes, something.

He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.

Good day.

Occupied France?

No.

Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?

I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.

-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.

Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?

No. No, Rick. Not tonight.

It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.

I don't have to. I've got them right here.

No.

And I said I would never leave you.

Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.

Be careful.

I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.

But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.

-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.

-- This is Mr. Laszlo.

You're saying this only to make me go.

Not at all.

Go ahead.

My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.

Thank you.

Yes.

Thank you.

I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.

Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.

Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.

If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.

Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.

But everybody's having such a good time.

How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.

Huh!

Our entertainment is enough.

Yeah? Have a brandy?

Victor Laszlo?

Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.

Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?

Excuse me.

I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.

-- Thanks. I will.

What friend?

It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.

I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

You think of everything, don't you?

Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

I never make plans that far ahead.

What is your nationality?

Put that phone down!

I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.

I don't want them here overnight.

Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.

Yeah?

No.

Yeah, boss?

Uh, my watch stopped.

Just a little something of my own.

No, I don't.

The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head.

No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.

Do too much, I'll die.

Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.

Shut up.

Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.

Well, not really, I --

You smell like formaldehyde.

I thought I did.

Let me guess, Russia came up?

Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.

A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?

You have any children?

Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.

It means a lot...that you came.

Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.

Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.

You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?

Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.

Mom, meet Jango.

It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.

Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring out the store bought.

Don't you even think about it.

This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.

Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?

It was fifteen minutes late.

I'm touched.

It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.

We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.

We're on.

Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...

It's me.

I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.

You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!

Believe me I know.

Deep, real deep.

Permission granted.

Life is waiting.

You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.

Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?

He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.

Better than I can!

She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...

Daddy, *please*...

Good night, Daddy.

No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.

When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.

When they watched at all. Do you like movies?

She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?

She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.

You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!

Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.

I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.

Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?

Not with the right girl you wouldn't.

Right.

It will be okay.

We've got to keep her away from that bastard!

You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!

No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.

Yes, I *have*!

I can't go nowhere.

Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!

They wanted a girl.

You mean somebody asked?

He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.

Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.

*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.

Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.

Have you enlisted?

The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.

Migrants?

Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.

Is it true?

Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.

You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?

Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.

Okay. Then you can be of use.

Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!

In other words, scurvy.

We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!

How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?

How long's this been going on, Muddy?

Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!

Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?

Not yet. What do you know about it?

You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.

Now, now. He's a good boy.

You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!

They told Muddy his feet was too flat!

We see you next harvest.

Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?

*You* taught her, I suppose...

I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.

Tough day?

That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.

On me. For the seat. Cheers.

They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.

You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.

You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.

Two million.

Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --

It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.

Know who I am, Jake?

Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.

We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.

Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.

I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.

The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."

Mob?

So what? We hide, right?

We sure Big Al threw him to us?

So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?

So what? We just stay clear of him.

Jake, I mean, come on --

I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?

And what about Big Al?

You sure?

I'd like this cashed, please.

I can't do that.

No. Just confidence.

I need you to stake me.

I said take off your fucking shirt.

Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.

Something stupid.

My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.

Very much so.

Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.

Why?

Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.

Lighten up.

Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.

Are you asking me if I have something to prove?

I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.

Lily... Jesus Christ...

Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.

You sure?

Where the hell is she?

There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.

Escorts!

Eee Oott Auught!

HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!

A little bit of both.

Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.

Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.

I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?

Whaddya mean? We got dick.

Roger that.

Whoa, whoa... There he is.

That's what I'm talking about.

No. Thanks.

It's the tension.

All men are cheats.

Why did you quit?

I can imagine.

Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.

Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.

How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.

Seven-fifty.

Habib?

She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.

You mean I won't resist them.

Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.

450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?

I'm on at nine.

-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?

You were talking in your sleep.

Then what?

All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.

You know where I'm from?

So why did you come to my casino?

The debts.

Absolutely not.

I'll watch.

Then you're not a pro.

Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.

I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.

Who's they?

I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.

What about my neck?

I can't do it, Jani.

Well, life's not fair. We know that.

Do you?

The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.

It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.

Jack! It's Jani.

Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.

How long have you worked at the casino?

Some other time.

You're talking about complicity.

Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.

Just girls. What are you drinking?

Any exceptions?

Five.

I don't gamble.

Yes.

No.

Very impressive.

Fine.

All right, Mr Reynolds.

Does he win?

A pleasure. Pity about Bella.

Oh. What's wrong now?

Key? Key? What is the key?

Key?

The key!

I don't have it. I don't know where it is.

Yoo hoo, bomb...

Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.

Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.

Energy shielding positive function.

Huh?

Hello, bomb.

Hey, bomb.

Bomb?

I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.

Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?

All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?

Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.

Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.

To explode, of course.

I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.

I'll check it.

Yes, Doolittle.

Any planets?

What?

Fred.

-- Remark.

Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.

...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...

Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.

Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!

Ah... pity, pity...

Doolittle, hello?

Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.

No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.

Phenomenology...

Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.

Bruno's girlfriend.

How I make my living, what's your point?

Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.

Yeah, sure, I understand.

Yeah?

Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.

What're you talkin' about?

You didn't tell me you lived with her.

Where?

You mean until you showed up?

Justine was not an unwilling participant.

No time.

I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.

Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.

Am I?

I got overhead...

And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.

Every week.

SHHH!  Don't do that!

Can you help me get her back?

Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.

I don't want to move away.

Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?

When?

The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.

Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.

Too early to tell.

Lauren's not my wife.

You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.

Yeah...

It was open.

Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.

Bent?

You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.

That would be appropriate, yes.

It's alright, Peter, we're fine.

You lost me.

How much do you know?

Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.

I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.

I don't know what to say.

And you still think you can do something to change that.

Zack... He made it... He's alive...

Ladies would be elsewhere.

You don't want to.

Any idea when she'll be back?

A friend of your fiance's.

To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.

With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.

Oh?

How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.

He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.

I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.

Here's your money.

Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?

Got a pencil?

Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.

Straight.

I just don't go in with any expectations.

What?

He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.

More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...

Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.

And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.

They're prisoners to their genes.

They don't have a lot of moving parts.

Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.

She's gonna want to hear for herself.

You get it when I get her.

You're the best, Maxie.

What if he's on the level?

But I'll take a rain check...

Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.

Max--

She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.

And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?

I'll give it my best shot.

Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--

None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.

I was on call. 

You're too kind. I'm Amanda.

Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.

I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.

He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.

I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.

Yeah, a man's drink...

You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?

Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.

Thanks.

It's okay.

What? That's disgusting!

Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?

Plenty, but it was all bad.

I've been in love with her since the second grade.

Curly.

The paint!

Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.

...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...

Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.

No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?

Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.

It's my Bullworker.

Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.

Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.

Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.

Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.

Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.

It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.

Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.

Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?

I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.

Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!

Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!

Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!

I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?

Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.

Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.

GOOD MORNING!

Yeah.

Donnie.

-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.

Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.

Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...

When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.

I can do anything I want... and so can you...

Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?

A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.

Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.

Hey...

He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.

With, like, images?

What?

She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?

Infant Memory Generators.

And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.

What's wrong with you?

Hey. You OK?

No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.

When did you stop taking your medication?

Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.

I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.

How so?

I met a girl.

I think about girls a lot.

It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...

The good stuff.

But it was an accident. The house was under construction.

How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?

If God exists?

Why?

Where is he, Donald?

Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.

What does time travel have to do with philosophy?

I was just being honest.

Her name is Gretchen.

Congratulations.

Okay, but it has to be a small one.

But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.

You're not a bitch.

Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?

That's enough.

How did you know --

What else?

Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.

But now you can't go.

Raspberry.

Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.

I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.

No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.

Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!

Here, have some.

Then it must be Wednesday.

I know.

Yah-sure, fine... fine.

Bye.

You could be quiet.

She's the winner and we're going to state.

What?

All right, then.

"U.S.A. is A-okay."

"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.

Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.

Gladys! Stop it!

Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.

English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!

He should be king!

The king can do to wrong! 

"My"...

"My dear"...

About - thirty-four seconds.

None of your business...  Take another letter.

Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?

I wanna powder my nose...

I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.

He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --

Yeh, he's only got one eye.

Yankee Poodle.

I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?

Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?

Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.

You was insulted, but you don't know it.

We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?

That's not bad for any day.

I can't do it...

Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.

Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.

Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.

Fine.  We gotta him. 

All right -- I'll go out and find one.

I can't do it right away.

If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...

You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 

Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -

You upstart!

Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...

No... it was a seven letter word.

You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.

Now -- er --

THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --

The king can do no wrong!

Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.

This is terrible!

I've always thought that myself.

If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.

No, I think a whiskey.

I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?

And here are my mother and father.

Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.

Hmmm?

Yes?

What do you mean?

You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...

I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.

All you do is profit from another man's misery!

You don't own this man!

Indeed!

No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.

No, more of an acquaintance.

Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.

Yes, I think I can.

I feel much better. Thank you.

Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...

Three quarters of an hour.

I knew you'd understand. Here.

Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.

I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.

Yes.

Yes.

My name is...

Righteousness...

You did not ask me.

Oh, our relatives... the children.

Your mother?

I thought as much.

Oh no, I couldn't.

You too, my friend. Goodnight.

I've heard.

Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.

We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.

I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.

I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.

Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.

Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.

I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.

Handsomely?... Who sent you?

Never mind. I'm the owner.

I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...

Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.

What are what?

These? What are THESE? They're swords.

PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!

I've never been to bed with anybody!

"The fifth one this week"!

Goodbye, Aud...

That's right!

I... but I...

Not quite...

Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...

Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --

Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...

I'm sure it's lovely.

No, no... It was very... er, nice.

Well, how d'you think I feel?

The important thing is not to panic.

But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.

Well you started it.

What a stupid idea.

I don't know! I just did!

Come on, move it!

I met this girl...

What "magic"?

Look out!

Oh... I feel a little... oh...

Who gets killed?

But...

It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!

Is THIS Hy-Brasil?

I have to go...

What do we have to do?

Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...

Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.

Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...

But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..

Honour and protect all blacksmiths.

Like you got rid of Snorri!

I know, Dad.

I must only let the red rage...

Sh!

GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!

Dad!

Me too.

Yes, Mother.

No, Mother.

I never do...

I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!

You did? You liked me?

I can't. I want to, but I have to study.

I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.

It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.

You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?

I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.

Why?

Why are you sorry? I just said hi.

Well, I didn't want to assume.

No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --

Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.

Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.

Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.

Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.

See, I wouldn't think that about you.

Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --

Yes?

No, that's okay. Thanks, though.

I like to read.

Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --

Sort of, um...

You pick it.

Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.

Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.

Yeah.

You'll call me, right?

Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.

It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!

Would you get me another, Joely?

No, it isn't that.

I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.

No. Thanks.

Yeah, Tangerine?

What do you mean?

I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --

Really? Is he cute?

I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --

Naomi, I guess.

Come up and see me... now.

Okay.

You had the whole human race pegged.

I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.

I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.

I don't think I've slept in a year.

I love her.

Um, no.

Oh.

I hesitated for what seemed like forever.

I walked out the door. There's no more memory.

Joel, come here. Please.

Make love?

I'm nervous, too.

Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.

I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?

That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.

Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?

Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.

Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.

Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...

Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?

I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.

Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.

Well... I did.

I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!

Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --

I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.

You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.

I hope you get your work done.

Very cool. Trippy.

Sorry. I just --

That's a good one.

This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.

Do you swear you didn't know?

Nothing.

Then why did you ask me?

How do you mean?

Is that Nietzsche?

I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.

The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.

I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.

Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.

This one's history. Moving on...

Patrick, we need to focus.

Jesus, Patrick!

Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.

Thanks, Stan. I owe you.

Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.

The Clock People?

How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?

No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."

FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.

'Drugged' is a stupid word.

If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....

Well.... er...

Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.

If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'

I have to go, Julian.

What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?

Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...

So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?

I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.

Coop, where are you...

On my way.

No, thank you.

Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...

There must be a way! What about Engineering?

No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.

His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.

"Another man?" Who?

I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.

"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?

Nothing. It's nothing.

His peritoneum has ruptured...

I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.

Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.

You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.

The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.

How do you know all this?

Yes, sir!

Justin. I won't let you die.

Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.

I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...

There's no one here, Skipper.

Do it.

The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.

"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...

The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.

I don't know.

The Core...!

Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.

You know.

You're lying...!

...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...

Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...

Starck, give me a read.

Smith, where the hell have you been?!

Captain, we got a problem.

What is it, Smith?

Come around to three-three-four...

But you can breathe it.

What about the life readings you picked up?

So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?

What is it, Starck?

I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.

Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.

He's been past Mars?

DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.

There's no one here.

Not according to the computer.

The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...

Get them back --

Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...

I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.

Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.

Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.

You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.

Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?

Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?

Victor must've taken him.

To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.

He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.

Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?

I already got it. Everything I want.

Ben. This is business. Just work.

We got what we wanted. That's enough.

Five times.

This makes five.

Should?

Well maybe you should date him.

Yeah, nine years straight.

Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --

Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.

Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--

Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.

'Course not. Strictly business.

Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.

The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --

I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?

I can go hotter!

They're not costumes.

At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.

History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?

Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.

Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --

You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.

I think it was a little more complicated than --

Of course. Of course.

Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --

Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.

Hilarious.

So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.

Reed, we're running out of time.

Ben did this.

What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.

It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...

I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.

For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.

Don't worry about it.

Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.

Totally.

Later.

No. I want my money back right now.

They're not home yet.

Maybe yes. Maybe no.

It's just Linda. And Mark from school.

Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...

They were left over from the last shift.

Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.

Oh, really?

I didn't see you this morning.

You should work for yourself.

Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'

Really?

What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.

It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.

Damone! You come here?

Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.

Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.

Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.

That's me, Merv.

Totally.

Then don't hassle it.

This ain't no cop.

They're fuckin' with us.

All right. Die, Granada Jocks!

Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.

Should we buy a frame for that?

I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.

Really?

No way! He just called him a dick.

It was okay.

Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.

Okay, penis, that's one, balls...

Climax together.

I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.

He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.

I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.

That little prick.

Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!

Yeah, like maybe never.

I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.

What class?

Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?

I don't know. I guess so.

You're gonna flunk me?!

No problem.

Yes... I am really nineteen.

What about those other guys you live with?

Yes.

We keep them, in case the people come back.

Oh yeah.

No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.

Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.

I'd like that.

Two Cokes.

You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.

My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?

Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.

Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.

Not where we operate.

Dobermans don't talk.

You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.

Naw! Not a major.

Las Vegas.

I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.

Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!

One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.

Jesus! Did I say that?

And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?

You whore!

Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!

Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.

OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 

He told me he was turning in early...

Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.

Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.

Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...

Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!

There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!

What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?

It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.

Maybe we should take it easy tonight.

They're actually nice people when you get to know them.

Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!

Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!

They were all veterans.

Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.

We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.

Lucy is looking for you.

Me?

It's gone too far.

Two glasses of ice water with ice.

How much is the lemon meringue pie?

YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!

Of course, officer.

Why not? It was getting warm anyway.

I don't know what you're talking about!

Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!

I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...

Yeah.

No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.

Hey!

There's a tunnel.

Follow me.

Shit!

The door... on three.

Why don't you go check it out?

Anyone else?

We gotta try.

The girl's got rhythm.

How much I got, what?

Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.

He only shot you once.

The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.

No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.

Fully.

Holds four.

Seven.

I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.

No bullshit.

Clear!

You keep that key handy.

Get something on that.

There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?

Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?

Not without you!!!

We all have to be strong, right?

I'll do anything to help.

I'd love to.

I think --

But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.

Putting on my armor.

Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?

'Forgive'...? For What?

I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...

My clothes?

I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.

I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'

Oh well. I guess I better leave then.

I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.

I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.

In my eyes, officer.

You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --

Who?

Dick, we need some time apart --

I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.

I know you believe that.

He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.

He's a socialist, then?

Be careful, Francie.

But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.

I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.

I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.

They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.

As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.

Fifteen.

Are you an actor?

I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.

You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.

Don't touch me.

Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?

Not me. But other people seem to.

Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?

Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.

Harry.

You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?

I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.

Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?

They killed him. They threw him out that window.

He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?

Forget it.

It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.

Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?

Frances...

Who said I was a lady?

Huh?

Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!

Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.

Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?

Well... I'll act like I do until I do.

Yeah. I don't know.

Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.

Why do you say that?

Just a little way.

Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...

What'd you do?

Run!

Who's writing this guy's lines?

No, I couldn't get my hands on one.

Who're you?

I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.

Yes, Ma.

Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.

Mama, what's...

You're taking me home!

Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?

Not long.

You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.

Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.

No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.

Thank you for understanding, Mama.

I will, I promise.

I have!

Don't I know you?

Oh bullshit.

Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.

Why, Doctor! We've only just met!

All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.

Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.

Yes. It was very good to see her.

But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?

Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.

You drove him to his torment.

How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.

There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.

Materials. Nothing more.

I don't know.

A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.

I will not! Kill me now!

Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?

And you look so lovely.

Nothing can. Not ever.

She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.

He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?

Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!

Not as weak as I.

...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.

But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?

I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.

A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.

Victor, tell me why! Trust me!

Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?

As a march hare.

Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.

No. He had more important work.

I've been preoccupied.

That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.

Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.

A... week?

This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.

I didn't find what I was looking for.

So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?

But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.

Victor, explain yourself.

It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!

But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!

Are you a physician?

There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.

I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.

Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.

Madness?

I was careless.

Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.

Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.

Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.

I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.

It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.

I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.

I don't know.

Almost five.

And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...

Not if they're where I think they are.

Absolutely.

I'll go take a look.

Marcie?

Oh, you...

Is it stuck?

I don't believe you...

Whatever you make yourself.

That was the telephone.

I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.

Coach, athletic director somewhere.

Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.

I call it my shower dream.

Lead the way!

Rocky Road.

Sure.

Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.

Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.

Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.

He's running the show.

Jacob.

He's my son.

That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.

Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.

Scott and Kate.

Real McCoy.

You won't let him touch her?

I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.

As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?

Forever together.

In the Winnebago.

What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.

I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.

Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?

I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.

Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.

Scott?

We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.

What you said to me in the room.

The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.

Yes.

You must have a bible in here, don't cha?

Okay.

Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!

Me too.

That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?

This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!

I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.

When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!

No.

-- This conversation is over.

Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.

What?

She's in the other room.

There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.

Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,

Duly noted. Now, shut up.

I did?

We are?

When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.

Where are you?

Thank you, ensign.

I've been accused of that wish.

I'm fine, sir.

It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.

Pardon?

No, sir.

Fuck me.

I'll act surprised.

Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...

Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --

That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.

Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.

Absolutely not.

If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.

What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.

Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.

The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --

No, ma'am.

I can make this wall without --

If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!

Sir?

Get it up!

Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?

Is this my glory, sir?

Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?

You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.

And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...

You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.

Yeah.  Me too.

Well, now I feel so much better.

That's a good story.

He was married?

That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.

This is insane.  You've got no proof.

Smoke it!

Maybe half.  Not even.

No.

Good to see you again, too, sir.

Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.

Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.

Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.

What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?

You knew about us?

Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.

I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.

It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.

You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.

No.

Yeah, well...

Sure. I'd like that.

When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.

I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.

I got pretty close.

So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?

I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.

Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.

Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.

Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?

What do I get?

Call me Charlie.

Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.

Well, I think you're cute.

Me too.

That is when we will go in.

We know.

Yeah, you're the worm guy.

No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.

It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.

What are you suggesting?

Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.

This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.

So you're in?

Good idea.

Don't do that. I'm not kidding.

Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.

Thanks.

"Just!?"

Like throwing gasoline on a fire...

Must be some sort of mining facility.

KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...

Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,

I had the shot...

They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...

...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...

Excuse me guys.

Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...

Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.

Okay, that's where you want to be.

Yes Commander?

It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.

Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.

Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.

Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...

The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.

What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...

Never mind, Fred....

Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..

I don't like this... I don't like this at all...

I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.

Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...

Yeah, what is it?

No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?

Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?

A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'

No. Keep all energy to the armor.

Hey, YOU want to drive?

On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.

Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.

We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.

Jason..

I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???

I don't think that's a cloud...

Computer, can it be repaired?

Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?

Nothing. Hold please.

Turn on the translation circuit.

No I don't. But I know somebody who does.

I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?

That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.

I see them!  I see them! RD STREET	PASADENA 57

Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.

Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.

Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...

It's perfectly safe. I promise.

NO, Thank God he has not.

Well... Sort of...

Okay, let's go.

They always say that.

Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!

You seem pleased by the prospect.

It comes down to leaders.  If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die?  The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.

But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?

We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?

You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?

A lot of years have gone by.

No.  I guess.

Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.

I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...

More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.

No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.

Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!

Yes, I believe so.

But it's more than just that, am I right?

Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?

He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.

He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!

Detained by what?

They help me understand why we fight.

The man is a traitor!

Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!

I... they look both the same.

I only meant...

Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.

But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.

My God, what?

And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.

What else?  From Virginia?

Martha!  For God's sake!

It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?

Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?

I'm with Captain Hamilton.

It is; we need you George.

That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!

Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?

It's the freest land on earth.

Let's get you darker!

Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.

Just because they are born?

I see...

That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.

So where's the money?

Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.

Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.

Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.

You spotted them, huh?

I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.

Sure. Family. I know how that goes.

Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.

Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?

You can talk to me.

Who?

Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.

What money?

Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?

What?

Bear, you're not really gonna -

Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.

By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.

Depends. Who's this?

Never heard of him.

Ray. Look at me.

Look at me, Ray.

'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.

Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.

I'm a producer.

Leo spanked a waitress?

What've you got?

I want you to keep looking right here, okay?

We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.

Fuckin' basketball game.

That's right. As a matter of fact...

The shylock's the good guy.

What I did till recently.  After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.

Because I need half a million to buy a script.

"Mr. Lovejoy".

Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".

So what's the problem?

But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.

Read it. It's a grabber.

They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.

I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.

I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.

Hey, Harry.

Get the fuck outta my chair.

Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.

You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.

With what? Wiseguy money?

I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.

I know who he works for. Where's your phone.

Man, can you scream.

Sounds fair.

For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.

How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.

Yeah. There's a girl in it now.

Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.

What happened?

Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.

Are you going down?

I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?

Couldn't find my toothbrush.

That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?

Don't say a fuckin' word.

Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.

Pick 'n' Save.

He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.

He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.

'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.

I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey -  This your ride, Chili?

Thanks.

Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.

Sixty pounds.

That's what it says.

Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?

Looks like it took out the backup genny too.

She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.

Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.

Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.

Bring it on, dude.

Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!

A what?

Right. Wednesday.

Smugglers maybe.

It's a risk I'm willing to take.

How long to fix?

Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.

Hard to say.

Three, four days.

Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.

Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.

Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.

Could be meant as a warning.

The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.

Don't lie to me!

Right.

He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.

Probably didn't have time.

Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.

No.

Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.

Yeah. Thanks.

Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.

Nope.

Of course I'm sure. I saw him.

I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.

Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.

Doesn't matter.

Wish I could say the same.

I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?

Showing you what?

That much I think we've already established.

Maybe it was more than that.

We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.

It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.

I didn't want it to turn out this way.

Go.

He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.

Alright. I'll be right up.

Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.

So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.

Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.

We could call for help.

Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.

Maybe.

Drink up then.

Lost my sea legs.

The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.

Shut up.

Fine with me.

Fifteen, at the most.

How should I know?

Who?

I guess.

Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.

Are you going to yell at me?

I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!

Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.

It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...

You can count on me, sir!

Okay, okay... I won't say a word...

No.

It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.

Oh my God, that's HIM!

Can I come in?

It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!

Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...

It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...

I know, she needs to die immediately.

We should follow them!

Okay, okay!

God, it's so totally pathetic.

God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"

Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."

Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.

I remember every minute of that party.

I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.

He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!

Totally! Look!

He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.

It's always closed...

As always.

Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.

He does that every single day.

Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?

God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.

That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.

Wasn't it like eighth grade?

Yeah, I guess... call me...

No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.

I can't afford stuff like this right now.

He came into work.

I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.

Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!

I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.

Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!

Actually, he's a really nice guy.

It just came yesterday...

Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...

A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.

Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.

I thought it wasn't for sale.

That tape sucked, by the way!

Yes.

Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!

Hey, where are you going?

Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.

Wow!

A dollar seventy-five.

So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?

Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.

I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...

Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.

Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?

Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?

Fine, I'll go by myself then...

These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.

I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!

What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.

Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.

Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.

No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...

I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --

Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...

That's the spirit!

Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.

Oh yeah?

Why?

Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.

How can you be so sure?

What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?

...I better not...

I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --

You must have done something to make her think you like me.

So, do you like me, Seymour?

FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.

Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."

That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!

At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!

...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.

Right.

Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.

I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...

That slut!

Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.

Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...

Why don't we start with that next week?

-malaria epidemic; very sudden.

Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.

But I have in India- every country presents problems.

I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.

How could it be? I hate Africa.

Starling?

Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.

-not a time for modesty, Bob-

You don't enjoy killing, do you? 

You never had it.

I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.

What if there are complications?-

We have hunted since childhood.

Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.

And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?

Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.

Shhh.

You mean nobody died?

No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.

It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.

Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?

Why?

The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?

Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 

Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.

Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.

Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?

Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!

We don't have a relationship.

Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.

Do you ever see him?

How is he these days?

You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?

Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.

Oscar!  You poor kid!

You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?

Oh, hello, Peter.

Peter, what about the bathtub?

It was full of this awful pink ooze.

Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.

Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.

So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.

What are you doing up here?

No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.

So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.

How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?

Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.

It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --

Yes, the scourge --

Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?

Who are they?

Get on with it, counselor!

I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.

You were the one who got me in.

Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --

This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.

I think they're more interested in my epididymis.

A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.

They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.

They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.

That's it.  It's on the bottom.

I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.

Dana!  Dana Barrett!

It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.

Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.

Okay, let's heat 'em up!

We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.

You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.

Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.

It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.

Huh?  What?

Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.

It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.

To the bathroom, where do you think?

It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.

Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?

Hi, Louis.

No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.

I am Zuul.

Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?

This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.

I'll scream.

All right.

"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.

You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.

Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.

I want you inside me.

There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.

Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.

He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.

We'll get back to you.

Print is dead.

What is it?

I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.

I'm always serious.

Yeah, I can smell it.

What do you mean "bad?"

I agree.

She said he was "the Destructor."

Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.

Neutronize.  System shut.

Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?

Looked at with your eyes.

You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.

Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.

This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company.

Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?

It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.

So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.

I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.

I don't think it's Shandor.

Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!

The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.

Right.  We'll believe anything.

Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?

I'm sure, I don't know.

Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.

I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!

Yes?  Go on!

You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.

Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a Republican by any chance?

On what charge?

How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir...

Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.

I wouldn't know who to bet on.

I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.

Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.

Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...

Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?

That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?

Yes, because I know they'll read it.

Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.

Yours will do!

"But what if I wish to be purple?"

Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.

Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.

Well, we can try...

I was summoned.

Isn't the helmet magnificent?

They're studying with Cynics.

If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.

I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...

No!

You teach them!

I killed too many barbarians.

I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.

General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.

Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before.

I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.

Don't be ridiculous.

What the hell are you talking about, Greek?

On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!

Right, right, what am I thinking of?

I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!

I want nothing to do with the arena.

Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.

No.

I'd love some.

No -- why should I?

No.

But, Elaine --

No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.

Yes, I do.

Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.

Of course not.

Yes.

During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.

Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!

Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --

Oh my God --

GET OUT!

Get out of here.

Ah. Where?

I thought he said by the monkey house.

Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --

What?

Did you say rape her?

But Elaine --

What?

Why wouldn't it?

Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.

No.

Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.

Hello -- who is this?

Is the doctor anywhere?

Yes, sir.

Yes I am.

What?

Oh -- no sir.

A room. I'd like a room, please.

Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.

What?

What?

Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?

Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --

I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.

Don't you think he trusts us together?

Would you like me to seduce you?

Get away from that door.

Let me out!

A drink? Of course.

Now?

That's fine.

Well -- do you want to go up first?

Yes.

The number.

Thank you.

What?

What?

Either one will be fine.

You're welcome.

That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.

Wait a minute.

Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?

How about art.

Don't you?

What one.

What novel did you read.

Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.

The driveway's on my side of the house.

Calm down, Benjamin.

Can I undress and talk at the same time?

No.

See if you can guess.

Think real hard, Benjamin.

Are you shocked?

What?

Not particularly.

Yes.

Why are you asking me all this?

Art.

Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?

I don't think we were the first.

What?

Oh my God.

Why not?

Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.

But why shouldn't I?

Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.

Yes.

You're not.

Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.

Of course you did.

If that's how you feel --

Thank you.

In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.

I'll find her.

Goodnight, sir.

I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --

Hello, Mrs. Robinson.

What?

Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?

Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.

Goodnight, Benjamin.

No.

Goodnight.

-- worried?

That has nothing to do with it --

No. She doesn't know about it.

No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.

I've got to go.

No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.

Oh yes.

Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.

Mr. Robinson?

It was nothing to do with you, sir.

Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?

I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...

Mrs. Robinson?

Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --

No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!

They are?  Come on.

Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I -- 

Splendid!

Well?

I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.

I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.

No.

I could take care of her.

You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...

You can't.

What about the money?

How?

Who?

That.

Free --

Will you do me a big favor?

Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?

And...?

I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.

I should like to smoke.

Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.

I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.

Oh -- 

I don't want them now.

Yes.

Shall I see you again?

I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.

I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.

Why do you think --

Bless you --

I'm Baron von Gaigern.

A little strange, Baron.

No thanks -- keeping my head clear.

No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron.

How's the beautiful lady?

That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?

I must have made a mistake.

Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.

No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.

Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.

No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?

Send his bags up to my room.

You are ill.

Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.

I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.

Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.

I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.

More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.

I never danced before -- in public.

Oh -- what -- what -- 

Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.

Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.

Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.

Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.

I'm the stenographer.

No -- only occasional jobs. 

That's from skiing.

Definitely off.

Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?

Well, he's a gentleman!

Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.

Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.

I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.

Ah, come on -- we're going home.

But, Madam. cannot do that.

The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!

Goodnight, Suzette.

Oh -- but it can't be.

There was -- there was.

But when did he go? How do you know?

I could not think of not accepting.

Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.

He tried to rob me -- he is dead --

I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.

The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?

No news yet?

Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.

Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.

Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?

I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.

My son --

I'll loan you a raincoat.

What's that, Lilly?

Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.

A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?

Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.

I will. So long, Bobo.

Fine.

Henry, no!

Can't move.

Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?

We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.

I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.

What? He's going to be all right!

It's not your fault.

That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.

That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?

No?

Oh, sure. Fine.

Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.

Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.

Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?

You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!

He let me live. He let me be his friend.

Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.

We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.

No. That was the point.

No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.

Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?

I've really got to --

Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.

You must have some money.

Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.

Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.

I know you do, so that's why --

No.

Uh-huh.

And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.

I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.

Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.

A future. The only future I've got.

) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.

No, baby. Come to Mama.

I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.

I'm a salesman.

Myra, I'm not following this.

Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?

But the setup's there. It's there now.

What?

Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?

Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--

Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.

Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...

Charming.

My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.

Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.

Get on the bus.

Who?!

It's always John.

It's not going to happen.

I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...

Michael Meyers.

You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?

Can't you hold it?

You're unbelievable.

You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.

We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --

Okay ... But just for tonight.

I promise.

Relax, John.  They were just kids.

A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.

What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --

What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?

Who are you?

Jamie?  But I thought she was --

No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.

Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?

Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.

I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.

No one.

One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.

The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.

This room is full of ghosts.

Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.

First Nagasaki--now this.

You know me, boy.

Oh.  I'd forgotten.

Sorry.

It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.

I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?

Maybe it's time you got out.

Everybody thinks that.

What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."

Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.

What?

We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.

You're hollow, like a woman.

Hello.

I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?

He worships Father.

Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.

Dad was never in England?

And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."

When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.

Scat!

Damn.

Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.

Nothing.

Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.

Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!

Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`

Heaven.

Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?

You are woman.  I know woman well.

My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.

A telegram--a phone call might have helped.

Nothing would please me more.

I did?

Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.

It's so--so stark.

Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.

You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.

Ram it up your ass!

That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.

People don't use that word any more.

You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.

I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?

I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.

Almost a Christmas scene.

Just one favor.

Like what?

If he thinks he's man enough.

You've killed women?

Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.

Gentlemen--that's nice.

It's always locked.

Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.

And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?

I've literally got to run!

Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.

What a brilliant diagnosis!

Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.

Are you've seen it work cures?

The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.

If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.

Poison.

My violin is avenged!

And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.

I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.

My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--

I heard you were looking for me.

Premature ejaculation.

That is sad.

Don't worry about it.

I don't want to live any more.

All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.

A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.

You're the only woman he ever took out.

I was afraid to ask.

It's beautiful.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?

You're taking Mom out tonight?

Keeps fairies away!

He isn't any friend of Father.

I'm glad.

Yeah.

He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.

Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.

I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.

It's suicide!

Why would you do that?

We've got to rescue him.

He's not your son.

We met here earlier this evening.

I believe in miracles now.

Tell her to have a nice trip.

Not true.

Penelope!  We're late!

I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!

He died of a massive rupture.

We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.

No.

But is she, has...

Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.

What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.

How many weeks?

The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.

Okay.

I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.

Overpowering?

You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.

Too bad. I wasn't in it.

Yeah.

Three hundred?

I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.

Half now, half later.

Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?

Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.

You used to work at Copper Penny?

No.

He deals in pain.

It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?

No, please go on.

Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?

Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.

You really believe all that?

Where does he live.

Do you live in a house back in wherever.

Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?

So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.

But then you'll forget about me.

Well, what do they know?

...What do you have to offer?

No.

You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.

Get out!

Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.

Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.

Like what?

Wes, Anne, come here a moment.

Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.

How did you find me?

Rucker.

Who?

Let's go.

I don't know what you're talking about.

I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.

My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.

Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?

What exactly do you have in mind?

In other words, you want to get laid?

It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?

Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.

Oh.

Who's that?

You're taking a big chance.

No, Andy. Don't know the kid.

You working in San Diego now?

Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.

Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.

Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.

Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.

Hello.

Possession of a stolen shovel.

And that truck - is it registered in your name?

Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...

I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.

Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?

Nice to meet you.

Your hearse?

No.

Oh, at the dentist's?

My door is always open.

Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?

Really. Do you think it's wrong?

That's really great.

Because they are all the same.

That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.

It is kind of rough.

No more revolts.

Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.

Yes. It's almost there.

Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.

What was that?

Of course.

Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.

I've never met her. My mother set it up.

Well, don't go.

Maude.

Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.

Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.

Harold, please! I'm on the phone.

At a funeral.

Harold!

Can't complain.

Ohhh. What's hari-kari?

Like a tea ceremony?

Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...

Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?

No.

Yes.

Thank you, Uncle.

Jeez! That's a great story,

You think so, sir?

I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.

Oh yes. That's fine.

Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?

Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.

Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.

Yes!

You a doctor, too?

Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...

Yeah. The things you were talking about.

Kyle, you don't have...

No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.

You were ALL human!

I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.

See what??

You mean, outside... with her.

Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.

Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.

Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?

What is it?

Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --

"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.

I have seen ghosts, Whitman.

Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.

There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --

I think that is its hand.

Reliquary --

Me?? C'mon --

That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.

Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.

As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --

"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.

You're doing fine.

"Myers", huh? You have a first name??

We're on the move.

Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.

His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."

I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.

Anung-un-Rama...

That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.

In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.

You call that thing a cigar??

No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --

That's right, Stud, hold me down.

Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head --

Start in, you got nachos coming.

Good night.

On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.

Alone?

Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --

For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.

Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.

What?

Oh, sod you.

Not much.

Do you really need this bed, lady?

It's just a puzzle box.

No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.

First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?

Poor baby.

I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.

Oh my God.

Who are you?

What?

Not know.

You promised me an explanation.

A box?

Hell...

And you came back here to solve the puzzle --

You're still afraid.

I said no.

It's just been empty a while.

We'll sell it. Sell everything.

So what's the argument?

I'm going to throw up.

Are you O.K.?

I've seen worse.

Please...

What?

You want something to drink?

Let's keep it that way, shall we?

That's right.

That's right.

Yeah, why don't I?

What's wrong?

What happened to me?

I won't be a moment.

I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?

I found a room.

I said: I found a room.

YOU'D like my room.

I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.

O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.

Sure.

I have to get out.

Please. I want to see you home. All right?

Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.

Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.

Don't let them take me, Steve --

Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --

Sure. Why not?

That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.

Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"

"Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?

It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.

Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?

To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.

Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?

Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.

What the fuck is that?

You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.

That's why you got the gig, isn't it?

That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --

That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.

Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.

Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?

I have a television.

It's the new --

No.  The Righteous Brothers.

Nothing.

Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.

Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?

Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --

I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.

I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.

Fine.  That's great.

Nice friend.

Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.

There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?

Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.

Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.

Fine.

I understand, Dick.

I want a tape.

Liz, hold on a second --  What?

Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.

You look upset.

We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?

Think about it, Rob.

Hi.

It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --

-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?

Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?

And do you like it that way?

I don't know.

No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?

So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?

So we have a chance of getting back together again.

Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --

Fine.  One.

You really think it would make a difference either way?

We'll talk some other time.

No, not -- I mean have you, you know --

Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?

You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.

I don't want to go back.

C'mon.

I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.

Hi.

I'm too tired not to go out with you.

Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.

To make you feel better.

You're tougher.

Harder.

Hi.  What are you doing?

At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.

Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.

Hey.  It's Liz.

-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.

Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --

Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!

Yes.  You?

Yeah.

That way.  You?

How's the store?

What do you mean?  Where did she go?

Then what are you getting so upset about?

It's the best collection I've ever seen.

Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.

Seventy-five.

Well we don't.

No, we...

I'm Vince.

Nice.

Maybe he's hiding from something.

Go to hell.

There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.

I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.

So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-

Yes.

You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.

That bothers you?

Have you gone to the police?

Not all of them.

Yes.

There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.

Yes.

Of bodies.

You killed those other two.

You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.

I'm just curious.

-In nomine sanctus esperitu-

Your name is Conor?

And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?

Pheasant.

This is madness!

Me arm hurts.

Go to hell.

I am not ready for this.

Of course.

But I did live.

So sure?

You seem to understand a great deal.

Thanks.

I don't know.

You were never a kid.

I've had a few more concerns.

MACLEOD!

It's all we have.

Should I care?

Yes.

It doesn't.

That's none of your business.

Where were you Tuesday night?

When may I expect the cleaners?

Why don't you fellows get your own news?

The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.

The poem?... The poem was great!

Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?

Seventy-five.

You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.

That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.

I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.

I lost my wallet.

Yes, wasn't it?

But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --

Not through any help of yours, Hildy.

Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!

Thank you.

You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.

No -- she didn't.

No. My mother.

I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.

Thanks a lot.

Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --

If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!

The money? Why?

Say, I want to be sure, too!

Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.

I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.

Your luck's not with you now!

All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!

The power of the press, huh!

Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?

You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.

Now, that's a nice thing to say.

Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.

Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?

Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.

Well, haven't you got anybody else?

Keep away --

That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"

Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.

Bermuda... Rich, eh?

Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?

I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.

Say, could I meet him?

All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?

What for?

Thanks.

Thank you.

Especially with an election coming up in a few days.

Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!

Yes. Where is he?

Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?

Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!

How much do you want on it?

Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!

Okay, Walter. 

What tickets?

You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.

What did you do with her?

Murder, uh?

In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.

Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --

I don't know what to do, Walter.

Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.

Walter!

Walter, you can't do that!

Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.

Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!

Beat it out and get hold of some guys.

I mean real money -- not counterfeit!

I'm busy, Duffy.

Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around. 

I think it is.

Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --

Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.

Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?

Three bullets! Any good?

Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!

Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!

Who's this guy she's gonna marry?

Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.

Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?

Three sixes. Is that any good?

So long, Hildy.

No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.

Little rum in yours, too?

Just coffee.  And you, sir?

Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?

What?

Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --

I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.

And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?

Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.

Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!

It's a frame-up! Some imposter!

Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.

But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.

All right, Judge.

Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.

But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.

Thanks. So long, Hildy!

You didn't mean to kill that policeman?

"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.

No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?

Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.

Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.

It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!

Wait a minute, Mollie.

I'll be right here. I won't leave you.

I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.

Huh?

I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.

Yeah?

I'll explain it tomorrow!

You can't bribe me!

You're insane!

Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?

Say, Hildy...

Why?

Very well, Grandpa.

No, she didn't.

Looking for shrapnel.

Who told you that?

They're not.

Bugger off.

Bugger off, you bloody sod.

Not now. They wouldn't believe me.

Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.

They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.

We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?

Weeds will grow, Mac.

Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street.

Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.

Propaganda. We've been had.

There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.

I will if you will!

And I'm still just a lad myself.

Jam.

That's it.

I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.

Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.

Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.

Wasn't it lovely?

Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.

You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.

Am I? Maybe I am.

Cool.

What about R.J.?

Who's your Daddy!

Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?

Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.

Nice.

You know... a couple of queers.

Holy crap, thanks!

Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.

Hot has got nothing to do with it.

Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."

OK, Boss.

Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?

How much further?

I'll help ya.

Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.

What I need are some answers. 

And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.

The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.

Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.

Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.

That seems likely.

Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.

These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.

I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.

I don't know, I think he's funny.

I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.

Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.

No please, let me sit this one out.

Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.

Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?

Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.

Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.

I don't know... about half an hour.

Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.

Yeah, no mercy here.

Yep, I suppose it is.

Huh?

What do they call you, sweety?

Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.

I don't doubt that.

Maybe. He's a real lady killer.

Firefly.

Great.

Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.

I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?

You said it, not me.

Huh?

I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.

No, just a little too old.

Don't worry, I'm gone.

Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.

Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?

You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.

Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.

My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.

I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?

I um... no, I don't think so...

What! God damn, how many?

Who's your Daddy!

Fit the profile?

No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.

Right.

I always favored the Hulk.

We found one.

It's embarrassing, okay?

Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.

Like father, like son.

Oui. Perfect!

Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.

I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?

Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.

Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.

But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.

You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!

I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.

That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!

Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.

Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?

Oui.

Okay, my sweet. Good night.

It's okay, Puff.

Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.

Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.

Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?

God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.

Really?

One night stand?

Lila, it's Rosie.

Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.

Oh, Rosie.

I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.

You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...

Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.

It's only that I really enjoy your company and...

Yes, and...

Nathan!

I'll be out in a minute.

Fifteen.

If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.

He looks perfectly fine.

Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.

Nothing. Be right out.

Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.

Don't quibble. You know what I mean.

Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!

I have to think! I have to think!

Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.

That's great.

Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?

I had sold my fucking soul.

That was wonderful!

Yahoo!

Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.

It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...

Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.

No.

Yes?

Yes... Derek.

Mm hmm.

You want a chaser?

I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?

Do we need words?

For whom and for what?

Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.

It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.

That's the way it's done.

It's possible.

Twelve thousand.

What did he say?

Cut.

Yeah? Why?

So I got talent. So what beat me?

Yeah. Sure, sure.

A thousand.

To do what?

For who?

You think I can lose?

You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.

Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.

You know everybody, don't you?

I been thinking.

Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.

What? And he -- he hustles pool?

I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.

I don't know.

It's a long walk.

What kind of straight pool game you like?

Want some free advice?

Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.

Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.

Approximately? One thousand bucks.

Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.

Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.

What are ya, chicken, Charlie?

Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.

I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.

I told you you'd get your money back.

What's the difference where? I'll raise it.  Is it all right if I have another drink?

All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.

Glad to meet you.

Oh no, nothing for me.

A dollar on the five, two on the nine.

You're a pretty good player.

Since four.

Fine, thanks.

Thanks. I will.

Why not? We already know each other's secrets.

How come you didn't catch your bus?

I'm not.

The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?

I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.

Thanks.

When you've got money, you'll pay.

Eggs. How do you like them?

It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?

Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.

I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.

Yes, I'm glad.

Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.

I'll be up later.

Well, what's the matter?

You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?

Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.

It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.

Yes.

Have you looked inside?

Yes.

I want to talk.  I just learned again.

Stay alive.

Virginia...?

That's fine.

It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.

That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.

Sure ... fine.

That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.

It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.

I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.

She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.

I don't see anything.

Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.

Hide the car.

Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.

There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.

What?

What kind, Mom?

All right.  I'll be right back.

I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...

Connie, don't hang up.

He's not going to listen to me.

All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.

More than likely.

Then get them out of there.

It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?

So sue me.

That's the good news?

I'm thinking.

Dad, don't start.

You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.

Just getting a feel for her.

But Mr. President...

She should be shortly.

And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.

Yes, Sir.

And our troops here?

I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.

Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.

Roger.

Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.

Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.

No Sir. Definitely not.

Well, er... it's slowing down.

It's... slowing down, Sir.

They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?

Sorry for what?

Butt-munch.

I'm a dancer.

I didn't even see them fire!

Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.

We're leaving.

Peace? No peace.

You are on your own?

You've got it!

Yes. My treat.

Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.

I'm going after Dad.

Got lost in his own museum, huh?

I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...

Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.

That was our assessment as well.

Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!

Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.

What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.

Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.

Are you sure?

You said go between them!

Don't know. Think of something.

My father didn't want it incinerated.

I came to get you! What do you think?

Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.

No, Dad. You did. Forty years.

Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?

Yeah?

Well, uh...

I came here to save you.

Don't worry. He won't.

So did I.

This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.

That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!

Hmmm... What did we talk about?

Actually, I was a wonderful father.

Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."

What happens at eleven o'clock?

Thanks.

It happens to me all the time.

"J".

Ready.

Who are you?

Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --

They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.

No.

No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!

I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.

Just a routine inspection tour.

Something magical. A sacred rock.

It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.

Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to get ready!

His Highness has not yet taken a wife.

What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show you!

Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?

Yes, I understand.

Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!

Lao She.

Step on it, Short Round!

Okay, Shorty.

It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.

"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."

Behind you!

What?

Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!

What evil?

Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?

Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!

Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!

It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.

A SNAKE!!

It's pulling me deeper!

Keep stroking it!

It's starting to let go!

I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.

Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.

Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?

No -- real food.

Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?

What -- the bug?

I'm going down.

Maybe... someday.  Not today.

You've got to go to sleep now.

No... they won't kill me.

What above the curves?!

Willie, come on!

You're not gonna believe this...

What is your name?

Where are we now?

Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.

Hear voices don't I.

Then I'm crazy.

Oh...Gooood!

Still clear. Just a motorcycle.

Too late...They want you.

Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!

I don't know. I don't want to find out.

We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.

With Authority!

What do you mean?

Nothing!

What am I supposed to do?

Use my credit cards.

Why not?

Who cares?

Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.

How else do you get seaweed under your nails?

Little late for that.

Why not?

Where are you going? Wait!

What? What do you mean?

Don't just stand there, say something.

.

Rene...

Well you did it today.

Who, me?

Just hold them close and stay still.

...I've lost something. I must get it back.

Joe! It's 56 hours!

No. What will you do.

You found her.

That's good. It's not better. Where?

We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.

I can't keep up.

That's not funny.

Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.

Don't worry!

You have to! Quickly!

Just say the words. Just like I told you.

You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.

...Shit! It's just money.

Where've you been?

About what?

Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.

I'll get us out of here.

Aren't we all.

It'll remind me of you.

Do what? What'd you do?

Don't give her your name.

Oh, I can't.

I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.

Who's our little man?

Then how did you know?

I dyed it. We're all getting old.

Surveilliance on them all.

He work for us?

We met on the beach.

He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!

You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?

Well what?

Oh.

What?

Oh yeah, thanks...

The little man in my...  ...head...

Been hearing voices.

Just give me the keys.

Sir?

Yessir...very good sir.

Do what?

...Rene.

Disinterest?

Why do you do it?

Why'd you run off?

They kidded me a little.

You did.

Why?

I'm sorry. What will you do?

I'm just on vacation.

What is it?

Get your things.

Ryuji and Gruner.

Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.

Beats me.

Get us one.

I asked him.

He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.

Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.

That I really don't know.

Why did you, then?

I love you too.

Her?

You are, I've seen you.

...Piece of mind.

Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?

Tear it apart?

Yes.

Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.

You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?

Because he has to reveal it in a court of law. It's on record, it's out. It's no secret anymore. So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? It's out in the world...

Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.

I'm cooking pasta primavera.

Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.

So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?

What caliber is your gun?

Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?

If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...

Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?

We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.

What about you, you got a crew already?

I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.

Catch you later.

Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...

Call me back in ten.

Jim, it's Lowell.

No, thank you.

What's the difference...

Did you say Berman?

"60 Minutes," the television show?

Hello? Yeah...

..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?

I'm alone on this...

No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?

Yeah.

Okay. Thank you.

I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...

Alright. What did you think?

Oh, lots.

Yeah... Thank you.

No. We don't do that.  You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.

If you want to do it.

No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.

Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?

I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?

Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.

You charge by the hour?

Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.

They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?

...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.

No.

You believe that?

They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.

No.

What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!

She sued you for back payments of child support?

ABC...?

A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?

What does this have to do with my testimony?

I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.

Yeah. Yeah, I will.

What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?

There is -- there is no family.

Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.

And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?

And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?

There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?

Chapter and verse.

You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.

A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!

What part?

Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.

No...

I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?

It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...

Set one side for Bel Air.

Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.

Asian? No.

What?

Yes?

What do you mean, was.

I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.

It's about time.

And you must be Mr. Massey.

Did you see the tape?

Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.

And you've always loved him?

Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?

Absolutely.

You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.

I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!

Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?

You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?

I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.

Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.

And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.

What is it Miles?

Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --

On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.

The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.

You can't prove anything.

Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.

It's not something I wanted either.

I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...

Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?

You have some?

Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.

I didn't know Barry had a beach house.

In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.

We do have a man for you.

I'm dying.

I want to be exposed.

He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.

He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.

Excuse me?

I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.

...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?

Mm.

That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.

Well -- is that possible?

Maybe I should reconsider my...

Sorry.

No. You're not.

HA!

Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?

I'd stay away from her, Miles.

Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.

Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.

"I found a million dollar baby"

That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami  for the love of it?

Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.

If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 

Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?

You're a peculiar chap.

The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to

You were taken for a buggy ride?

A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.

Why don't you put me in chains?

All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!

In that event, we won't need so many supplies.

I'll get it annulled.

Never mindI'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.

I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!

No.

I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.

It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 

Why? Do you know him? 

You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?

I suppose so.

Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roadsall transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"

But the lady says

What happened to your money?

Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn As life's corners I . . .

"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."

Huh?

Hey, whadda you tryin' to dokid me?

I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.

Yes.

I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?

Will you please tell me what you're raving about!

Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.

That's none of your business.

Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 

I kind of half expected you to thank me.

Oh, this?I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.

Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.

What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  Youyou had it pressed.

If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummerwe'd have been through with breakfast by this time.

I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.

No. No. It's too good a story.

Um. You're doing all right.

Santa Claus?

Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?

Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.

Well, you were!

Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.

Next week "East Lynne."

What's the matter?

You didn't give that boy all your money?

Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.

remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride

wasbut

was so scaredthat it scared

Raw?

You figured that all out yourself, huh?

Amazing.

You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a carand I won't use my thumb.

Come onget in.

Darling!

Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.

I'm out! I'm out!

Come here, you little fool!

You sound like a hobo.

Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!

You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.

Yes?

What time is it?

Just your imagination.

Bridge washed outaround Dawson.

That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that

Wait a minute, GordonI

To tear down the Walls of Jericho.

Okay, pete. 

Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarnthen something comes alongmesses up the finishand there you are.

ain't got a hat

They're married all right. I just seen the license.

He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.

Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.

Better start gettin' into your clothes.

Zeke.  Git!

Hey, you!

I'd like to sit with myuhwifeif you don't mind. 

You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.

You're not making any mistake, believe you me.

Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeand

The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...

My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks.  If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.

I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.

Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...

Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.

I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.

Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...

Frank, I don't want to hear it.

So why does he call himself Bertrand?

Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.

At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.

I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.

Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.

So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.

Yeah.

He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.

If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. 

No, I did not.

Calm down, Dave, what?

What did they...

Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?

Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.

I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?

That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.

Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?

What was so appealing about Houston?

Dave, I find your story simply not believable.

You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?

Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!

But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?

If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.

Hi, Freckle Face.

Well, it looks like it, Jasper.

No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?

I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.

Makes sense - he's a spokesman.

None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.

Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.

I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?

Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.

Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.

No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.

One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.

Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.

Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.

Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.

Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.

And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.

It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.

I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.

It's going to get worse, honey.

Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.

What?

I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.

Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.

Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.

Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!

Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...

The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.

How many men?

The Warren Commission call him?

We need him back.

I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.

I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...

Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.

No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.

Any chance of one of them confessing someday?

...and your General?

More than ten years.

Was he there often?

It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.

You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...

Then what are we going through all this trouble for?

Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.

I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...

That's it.

Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.

I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.

Who was there for your ass?

Who?

I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.

Three years.

Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.

A bit.

I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.

Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.

What time do you have to be there?

The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.

'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.

She leaves, somebody'll be on her.

We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.

What's your brand?

Was she helpful?

I am, as a matter of fact.

So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?

I didn't?

Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

He's got that kinda money?

If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?

Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?

You went out this morning and bought a gun?

If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.

You're not old. You look great.

Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.

I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?

She's adorable. But I had to end it.

He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.

I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.

He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.

A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.

Why?

When did you decide?

That's my job.

More or less.

What if I've figured a way?

Do you think they bought it?

You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.

Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.

He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.

Why?

What if he hears something he's not supposed to?

I hesitated taking that much.

You'll get over that.

Not every day?

No.

Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.

We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.

Ever meet her, or they talk about her?

What's her story?

And splittin' with her?

She told you that?

But she mentioned Beaumont by name?

I was told ten thousand in each pack.

After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?

You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.

Not in the fitting room.

It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?

You'd take a polygraph on it?

Do you think I took some of that money?

Buy ya a beer?

Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.

This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.

Beaumont Livingston?

Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.

They asked.

Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?

I said, you understand what I'm saying

Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.

Talk to you tomorrow.

Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?

Who?

Yeah, I think a woman.

But you don't?

Man, I don't like that part.

I'm impressed. He knows a lot.

You been to Japan?

Must of made quite an impression.

That sounds like a problem.

Yeah.

I wouldn't go so far as to say that.

No.

You live with him.

I'm getting out of here. What do you think?

Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?

What do I do?

Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.

The moon -- I dunno

An employee I had to let go.

So we on the same page then?

That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.

Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.

That's right.

It's in there.

What?

You gonna tell me who it was?

Cops can't locate him, huh?

Beaumont. That's the only name I know.

Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?

I got some more business for ya.

Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.

If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.

She got off, huh?

Winston found you.

My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.

That I gotta see.

Have her bring the money here.

I call your office, she better answer the phone.

I know where to turn.

It's Beaumont.

No problem.

No! Oh God.

Hello, Sam.

I'm okay.

It's short, huh?

Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.

That's right. We did.

Listen, Jake. I gotta go.

Don't bother to call again, okay?

Tell your mother.

Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.

What the hell is that supposed to mean?

Why do you say that?

No. Not really ...

Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.

Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.

Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?

I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.

I'm walking, aren't I?

Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.

The postal service. I'm a mailman.

I haven't seen her in months.

Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.

See them?  What do you mean? Physically?

I don't know what to say.

I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.

But I see them.

Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.

Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.

This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.

Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?

No. Don't move me.

What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?

I didn't want to wake you.

A good lay.

Lemme see.

That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.

Look at her face. A real bitch.

Gabe.

I don't like things that make you cry.

What's wrong?

Why do you bring her up?

When was the last time I said a word?

What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?

They weren't human!

Where?

Where's Della? Bring her here?

It's gone to the top.

Sam, Tony, come in here.

Am I home?

In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.

Why didn't you call me?

What? What do you mean?

It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.

I promise.

No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.

Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.

Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.

I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.

Don't be funny.

Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.

Shows how much you knew.

Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.

Like it was yesterday.

What is it?

I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.

For what? For seeking the truth?

You come near me and I'll blow us all up.

That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.

Help me!

Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.

Of course it is. What else could it be?

Jacob Singer?

Paul Gruneger!

I work in a bakery.

Nope.

God almighty. I thought I was the only one.

Bring it in.

Punk?

He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.

Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.

We don't have a choice!

Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.

He came for me, I had to run!

What are you doing back?!!

Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?

We could convert fission transistors.

I don't know!

Suit up.

Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!

Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.

No, you're dead! You're all dead!

Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.

Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?

It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?

That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.

We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.

She needs a little time.

Oh I like her a lot.

Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!

Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.

They'll make it.

Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?

Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!

That ought'a help the situation.

Oh my God! Adrienne?

Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.

Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.

Defense droids. I'm on it.

Then open the doors!

We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.

If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?

See you then . . . doctor.

We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.

JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!

But...I...400 years?

Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.

You're crazy!

Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.

I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.

All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.

We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.

Have to pump her steady, s'all.

Have you ever had one do this?

Michael! Come inside!

I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...

Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.

Martin, we hired the best man we could find.

Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.

I don't know if I can do that without a...

I was acting in the town's best interests...

My kids were on that beach...

Who are you?

No, it was local jurisdiction.

No, we just checked the beach...

You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?

You could say that.

Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.

Chum?

It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!

Be careful, for chrissake.

A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...

I didn't know her.

Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.

Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.

No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.

Set?

Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.

Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.

I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.

Transplants?

I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.

Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.

Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...

Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...

Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.

What do you see?

Ever see one like this?

Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --

And I'll drink to yours.

Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...

Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.

Thanks for the message.

Cool.

I'll see you at school, O.K.?

Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.

Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.

Were we together?

I totally heard you did.

What?

Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.

Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?

Yeah. That was me.

Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.

Also, I think I'm in love with you.

No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.

No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.

Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.

The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.

Yup.

I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.

No... I guess not.

What are you talking about?

Hon, did you get expelled?

But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.

It really didn't hurt that bad having him.

Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.

I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.

I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.

The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.

That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.

Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.

You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.

Come on, I have something for you.

You're gonna like this, I promise.

Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.

Oh really?

Nothing...

Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...

Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"

I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.

What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?

Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.

Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!

Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.

My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...

You're pregnant?

No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.

Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.

You mean like couples?

Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.

It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.

Thundercats are go!

It was magnificent, man!

I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.

Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!

Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!

It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.

No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.

Or stage parents!

Share the love, Tits!

Right, seriously.

Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.

Well, you are kind of... convex.

Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!

Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.

You don't make anything. It's for exercising.

I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.

Don't mock me.

Looks like it, yeah.

Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.

Karma.

Could I try that?

Sure.

You think Early's bad to me, don't you?

What's Early been in jail for?

...That's not true.

Almost.

I heard that.

They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.

Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.

Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.

Early, sing me a song.

I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.

I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.

What do you need a Bible for?

Best kind.

Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...

How much do I owe you?

I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.

Yeah.

Ain't you goin' to record it?

No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.

If you say so.

Who do I have to blow to get out of here?

The party?

It was definitely the high point of the evening.

...I think it's the best stuff I've done.

A book on the warehouse murders?

Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.

You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.

Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.

Why, what did he do?

...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.

...Brian hurt his foot.

Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.

Where would we find him?

...That'd be my guess.

With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.

Yes.

Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.

Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.

Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.

You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.

How?

Yeah.

What do you want?

What for? That guys a dick.

You think he's got any herb?

He lives on 76th?

The cartoon?

He looks like my uncle.

Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.

Shut the fuck up.

Hold up man.

Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?

Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.

Na.

Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.

Hey. What are you doin' right now?

Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!

At the block party?

You were?

Yeah. I can understand that.

Yeah?

Yeah.

Why is that?

I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?

I guess so.

15.

No.

Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.

I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.

Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.

Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.

No. I just gotta go find him.

Whah?

Because he can like climax you up to that...

It's like...

Yeah.

Oh god. That's horrible.

And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...

It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.

Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.

What?

Let's see how much he wants to play.

Get off me!

Sit down!

You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.

He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.

I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.

What was your relationship with her?

I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.

Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?

Find him!  I want to talk to him.

I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.

Did anyone stand out?

Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?

Where is she?

If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!

Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.

Not really.

Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.

You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?

I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.

Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?

I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?

The game's over.  You lost.

Very good.  How did you know?

Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.

Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.

He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.

Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!

I'm just nervous.  Sorry.

Why did he what?

Uh huh.

Boys.

Nice meeting you.

My cheering section.

Okay.

Six, eight hours tops.

No prints.

There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?

Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.

What did he mean by Huxley?

I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?

He moves around a lot.  Why?

The most logical choice.

Ten days ago.

Through a rental agency.

We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.

How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.

Are we going to go through this again?

Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.

I signed the confession.  What about the car?

It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.

Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.

I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.

It's alright.

When I was very young.

I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?

I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.

Why?

How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.

No.

Because I think he's wrong.

You always want to talk about me.  What about you?

No.  You were talking about chess.

And you?

Yes you are.  You're playing word games.

I said I didn't plan on getting involved.

What do you want on it?

How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it?

For emphasis?

No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.

I don't have to go through with it either.

That's worse.

Well, you're beautiful.

<u>What</u>?

Never mind my ears! Go away!

No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.

I know it.

Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.

Yes.

It was a platonic kiss, Father.

You won't have to.

Reach out farther. Call to her.

Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.

What do you see?

No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.

He has come for Lyssa.

No. She must agree of her own free will.

He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!

Let us wish him peace.

Where the spiral begins.

I chose the wrong passage.

Each to his fate.

I cannot take comfort when she has none.

Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?

You will follow me.

So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.

Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.

Hand over your dinner.

What kind of friend do you think I am?

Yes, my lord.

The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.

I have a cinnamon bar.

You had better manners as a pig.

Look at its insides.

And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?

Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.

It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.

It is important to assure the succession.

That I am, my lady.

They will have the life that you and I might have had.

Yes. We lost five.

Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?

I will seek the Fortress for you.

They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.

The Widow of the Web?

She has the power to kill.

You lie!

There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.

...What?

What?

You were scared, weren't you?

Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?

Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.

Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.

I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.

...Yes.

Good! Snipers can't be in position.

Mathilda, listen!

Huh? That's smart!

Huh? Why?

Can I sit on the stairways now?

I know... But I'm a little pressed.

No... Dino's.

Yes... Twice.

You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.

Salute.

I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?

Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.

I have new dreams now.

It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.

You'd be visiting me at Nasa.

Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.

I'm completing the walk.  I'm almost there.

I won't let you die.

Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.

I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.

A couple days to a few months if untreated.

Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?

No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.

That's enough.

It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.

I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.

You have?

Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.

You're talking to me?

You've just decided, is that right?

He's plastered.

I think it's a different place for each person.

When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.

I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.

I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.

About my love for her.

Not our problem.

This guy's not a murderer.

That's all right isn't it?

You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.

Nine.

Making the grand total?

By car right?

You're amazing.

Pulitzer, here I come.

To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.

She knew you loved her.

Why know?

... The Grapes of Wrath.

What, come on?

I do.

Which hospital?  Did you take me back?

Someone should be with you.

Hello.

What?  Who are you?

Evening News?

Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.

...Noooo.

No.

No.

Water.

Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.

Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...

Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.

You what?

How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?

No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?

Is that really what you want to ask me?

Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.

That's astonishing. Sera, look...

Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.

What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!

Don't be silly?

What?

Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.

Sorry.

No?

When?

Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.

I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.

That's impressive. How did you do that?

Be careful.

OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.

I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean.

Let's stay for a while.

And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.

One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.

I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.

How much, do you think?

I am lonely, Yuri.

It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.

I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.

I can't tell you.

He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.

Get up.

That's not what's important.

You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?

I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.

I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.

Yes. I was washing my hair.

Yes.

Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.

That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.

I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.

You're a beautiful girl, Elle.

Yes, I am.

But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?

Just the love in my heart.

Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.

For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?

She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.

That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...

No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".

Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?

What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law school don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding myself -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else. It turns out, I am a joke.

Relation?

Yes, you are.

Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.

Thank you. I love you, too.

Your scrunchie?

No way --

I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.

I wasn't gonna --

Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --

But maybe it is --

Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."

That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!

Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?

Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.

Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.

I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.

We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.

I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.

She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!

Your what?

My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.

That's why I think it's time for us to --

You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.

How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?

It's not a Theta --

I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?

Faith.

I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.

Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.

What do you want with me?

Grotesque... monstrous...

I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.

To be my bride, of course.

Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...

Kill me... I want... so nice...

What will become of me then?

I see...

Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!

From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.

So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.

I didn't know... I --

I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.

No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!

A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.

Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?

I fear she's lost.

What does she want from me?

Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --

How is it this hag knows the truth?

Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.

Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.

Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.

You do the praying.  I've work ahead.

We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.

Save your mischief for the Black Baron.

Aye.  And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.

Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?

Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.

Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.

It bodes evil.

No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.

Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...

Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.

We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.

Will you chance a miss?

It's what we'll find there worries me.

... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.

Mean you to seek him out below?

Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.

Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?

Where?

Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.

No, no, no... this is different!

Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.

All right.  I'll show you something sacred.

Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.

I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.

My father and the Baron.

It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.

I don't want to be reminded of what happened.

A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.

Jack... Forgive me...

You've freed me, Jack...

And I... love you...

Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.

Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work.

Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.

That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.

Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.

I pray God grants it me.

Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.

You... you... you mortal you!

Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...

Be fair, Oona.

I think she's about to foal.

I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.

I'm sending you back to Hell!

You follow.

A castle's but stone and mortar --

We did a lot of the wiring too.

Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?

Mom said I should.

I don't think Dad wants you home.

What color?

Here, honey!

Who are all these people?

Is that legal?

Nope.

What's that?

He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.

He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.

He jumped into the ocean.

Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.

I'll get your back.

If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.

Will he talk to me?

If that's what it takes.

It's thirty feet.

What are you on?

I'm not.

Maybe that's too long.

I hate this job.

It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?

For everything.

There are no windows facing my...exposure.

I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.

To check up on me?

Why would you be there?

No I'm not!

No you don't.

You're so predictable.

I don't know.

Sit down for a second.

I know.  Why?

How do you become something you're not?

See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.

What do you know about me?

He's got nothing to do with me.

I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.

I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.

To hide a black eye.

I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.

After everything he did to you and your mom?

Are you taking them still?

You know what mortise and tenon is?

A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.

I know there's an explanation.

Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.

You let him pierce his nose?

Where is he?

I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.

Why call me?

Money?

Where will you live?

Let's go.

The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.

I think so.

That was the truth.

I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.

No.  Mostly me.

I'm an idiot to have you up there.

I'm thinking it's too weird now.

The payoff.

Sooner than the Fall.

So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?

You live a fabulous life, Robin.

Do you like red?

Yeah.

I just thought it would be nice.

Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!

Is Spanky here?

Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.

But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.

Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.

That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.

Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.

Yes, sir.

Goodnight, Claude.

As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.

Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.

I know it begins with a "C"...

You're cute. You have any money, Claude?

Claude Banks.

Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay.

I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.

Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.

Why didn't you take it?

So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?

Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!

Yeah, I want some pie.

So you made a generous contribution.

That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.

While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.

Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.

Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!

What about you, Radio?

Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.

No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.

Forget it.

Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?

Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.

Absolutely. The map is very clear.

Cookie didn't draw it. I did.

I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.

So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?

We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.

Let me see that.

I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.

I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.

They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.

After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.

That was five years ago.

We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.

Don't touch that car.

You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?

What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!

And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.

Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.

An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.

You didn't get ketchup?

Yeah? You and what army?

I'm all right.

You heard the boss! Let's move!

He must still be in there.

Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?

You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.

Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?

Something like that, yes.

Like you shot Winston Hancock?

Satchmo.

That's a long story...

They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.

Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.

He's sick?

Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.

Absolutely not.

Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?

Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.

Urr... uggg... errr...

We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.

It's not me, moron.

I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...

It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.

Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.

Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.

The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.

Everything's fine, pop.

You did it for Namath.

Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.

The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.

So go get 'em, Dad!

Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?

Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.

What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...

What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?

Beast.

I know, your wickedness.

I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.

You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.

Oh, would you grow up.

'Bout time...

We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?

Peppermint... alright.

Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?

Oh, that's terrible, Reege...

You followed him?

Andrew.

That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.

I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.

Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.

I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.

Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.

Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.

Okay, I do. Get back up here.

East Rutherford.

I have to, Valerie.

Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.

No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.

I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.

You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?

Where do you send them?

Well... you can't have them all.

I'm in my party mood.

You? Why? You're already beautiful.

Anybody we know?

It has nothing to do with you.

Here.

I'm very smart.

No.

Not about that.

I suppose. But what if you want to live?

I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?

Then it's still no.

You know.

You know something.

Both... running's what I'm interested in.

What do you need?

We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?

I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?

All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.

Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --

They won't believe us.

We'll convince them.

Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.

You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?

We'll be all right...  We will...

The Lifeclocks have no power outside.

You know, Jessica.

Of course.

Yes. You and I, Jessica. 

Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.

But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.

We'll remember. But that's a long time off...

For as long as I can remember.

Alive?

Yes...

Okay.

Texaco... What's wrong with that?

What?

Yes, I thought my wife...

What do you mean by that?

What is?

I don't know.

He makes films for Mr. Eddy.

Andy?

We killed him.

We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.

I gotta headache... What's goin' on?

What happened to me?

The wife killer?

Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.

He's in the infirmary, being examined.

I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.

Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.

You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?

I don't know yet.

Not even close.

No, no. I want to go in.

I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?

No, no I don't. Are you sure?

Wake me up when you get home.

Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.

That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.

I don't know. Maybe a hotel.

Just a minute.

Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?

I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.

Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.

I can see that.

Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.

Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.

Okay.

Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?

Yeah?...

Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".

I don't remember... What happened that night?

I don't want to talk about it...

You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?

You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.

Thank you.

Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.

A paleontologist.

It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.

Okay, brother.

Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!

Good morning

I see.

Oh, really?

Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!

Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.

Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?

All right, all right. Keep quiet.

Will you stop squawking!

Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.

It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!

You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.

They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.

So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.

I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!

I'll say.

Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?

It's unbelievable.

Look, Bob!

Leaving?

Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business

I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.

How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?

They were.

Centuries.

Why not? She's an attractive young woman.

No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?

Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!

Yes.

I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?

Oh, dear.

Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?

Oh, the girl at the piano?

But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.

Yes.

Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!

Come on! Quick! This way.

Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.

Yes, Bob.

I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.

I don't know. I can't get the dialect.

That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.

It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.

What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.

Let me go, Bob!

I don't need any proof.

Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.

Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?

George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.

Yes.

I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.

What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.

Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?

Where are we going? Huh?

That was easy. I read your books.

Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.

Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!

I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.

How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.

Yes.  Barney!

Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.

And Goodwill Toward Man?

Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.

I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir.

Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.

His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry

Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--

All the time, sir.

I'd go with number three.

Don't worry about it.  It's been a long night.  Speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember?

Why?  What are you gonna do?

What?

Right.

So what's the problem?

Keep her out of here while I check it out.

I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.

Gee.  You really think?

I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.

Where to?

That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?

Get back in the car!

I dunno, man.  Maybe we should.

Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?

Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.

Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?

Do his job.

Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--

Kay!?

Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.

I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.

Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?

Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.

Do have any idea what I just said?

Why not?

What is it?

Actually... I don't know.

The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.

You figured what?

Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.

You're not taking me in!

How could it not?

Yeah, Kay?

How'd you know that?  Kay?

What if I don't?

This guy.  Where was he?

Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.

Fine.  Good.

He'll turn around.

Why?

Who wanted her little girl back?

Then who was he?

Found?  Where?

It's all I could safely move.

How do I find the --

No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.

On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.

Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...

I understand.  What's the other thing?

He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.

Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?

And who the hell is that?

How could Witwer have accessed the case file?

You're kidding, that's today?

You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.

Run the subscription list...

We're in motion on something.

Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.

Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.

That was easy.

Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...

Yes, it is.

I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.

Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.

It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.

To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?

Oh... Hi, John.

That's right.

So?

Tell me how.

That's great.

All right, I'll try...

You gotta have faith, Dad.

Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --

What the fuck is going on?

If I tell you, my family gets nothing.

You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.

I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.

You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.

You say some of the children died?

So you won't help me?

Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.

Do you?  Really?

Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.

Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.

Sean --

No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.

Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...

Not quite.

We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...

That's the Red Ball Alarm.

I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.

Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.

No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?

We can stop him.

I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?

How many?

Sure.  Raincheck.

I forgot my glasses.

Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?

But John was with him at the pool?

I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.

Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.

Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.

No thank you.

When served warm --

What if I gave you forty?

See you later.

We're in Fashion.

Holy shit.

He's alright.

No more.

She's, uh, sleeping.

You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti

Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?

I love you. Come home.

The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.

A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?

Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.

I'm ready.

Yeah? You sure?

Shhh. He'll hear you.

Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.

Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.

I had a fight up at Sportsman's.

She'll be out in a minute.

To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.

A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.

They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.

She was fast, huh?

So, that's it. I'm out?

I know.

How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.

Yeah.

You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.

We get it. We're sorry.

Hi. I'm Jimmy.

Soho.

Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.

You don't know where you're going?

Well, this is the corner.

You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?

Excuse me, we need to make a call.

Listen, man, we really gotta...

Ruiz isn't here.

Thanks.

So?

It's not losing record.

Yeah. I know the number.

I will.

Bye.

We don't need guns.

We'll kill Fairfax this year.

What are we delivering?

Who is this fucking Ruiz?

Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.

I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.

C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.

See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?

I'm not taking her to a bar.

Yeah, I guess.

Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.

Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?

What are you doing?

I told you what they said.

They asked who it was.

Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.

You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?

I mean, that's what I heard --

I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.

Like I said, I don't know.

You would think.

You too?

Work's over. I'm gonna party.

She was jonesing for me.

Where?

Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --

I'm your soldier.

Did you hear what he just said?

I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him

You're out of money?

What do you have left?

What happened to the fifteen hundred?

Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?

Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.

I don't want to take any more chances.

Where do you get this shit?

Bobby and Ricky.

He's on the list.

A little.

Yeah, uh, what's the movie?

Drinks are free, right?

'Strapped?'

What? Why am I bad?

Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.

How's it going?

That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.

You'll love it.

I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.

So tell me how it is.

What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?

Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.

So, you must be the Red Dragon.

A rose by any other name would --

He had it coming.

Red, and I ain't no punk.

Man's rep travels.

Solid, daddy.

I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.

Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?

Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.

There's two guns on you.

That's what it is. Walk on out.

Now.

No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.

You putting a hurtin' on my vision.

I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.

That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.

I ain't said I'm ashamed.

Tell you this: you ain't no fool.

What do you do with your time?

But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?

Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.

Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?

The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.

You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.

I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.

Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.

Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.

That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --

How do you like it?

How old are you, Betty?

Yes. Did you eat?

The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.

Let's get out of this cold.

Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.

The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.

You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?

Just what is your question?

Entirely.

Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.

Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.

All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.

Your control over your children, therefore --

You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.

500.

How long has this been going on?

What does Sidney say?

No. You'll be marked for death.

And don't come back.

Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.

You better believe it.

Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.

Fine as May wine.

Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.

You the man!

It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.

What can you do?

Brothers of Brother Johnson.

Watch your tongue, boy.

All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.

It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?

My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?

Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.

It's a little late.

So what do I get in return?

He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.

[Si.]

[Daniel what?]

[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]

[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]

[Not for a long time, sister.]

[Who ordered it?]

I don't know, but I know his face.

[How do I recognize him.]

[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]

[It's non-negotiable.]

[Lucky how?]

[And?]

[O.K. So tell me more.]

[The ransom was ten.]

[That's what everybody keeps saying.]

Yes.

It's loaded.

I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?

What do you mean, I'm here?

Nothing wrong.

Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.

Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.

I said the plan was right here.

That's right.

Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.

I'm not crying.

It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.

The gunshot holds no fear.

Your father has business.

Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.

There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.

It's war. The weakest suffer the most.

So are you.

I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.

Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?

And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.

Do you know what she told me last night?

I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.

She understands men.

[Yes.]

When?

Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.

You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.

Our daughter.

Hmm?

She's young. She'll get over it.

[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]

[You only give information so you can fuck me.]

I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.

Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.

I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.

I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.

I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.

You told me.

What happen?

Your son Marty?

They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.

This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.

I'm having a very good time, too.

I'm thirty-four.

There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.

I really should get home...

I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...

Why don't you just move out to Portchester?

Yes, I know.

I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...

All right.

We just live one flight up.

Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.

Goodnight.

Where you going now?

Sure, what?

Tomatoes.

You gonna die without a son.

Put on your blue suit...

Sure.

What, Ma?

She didn't look Italian to me.

What didn't you like about her?

Hiya, Ralph...

No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.

Well...

Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...

You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. 

Siddown, Thomas, siddown.

So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...

Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.

I'm gonna see you tonight...

I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?

Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?

I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...

Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.

You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.

Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.

Home.

Hospital.

Back home.

No.  Or why you should.

I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.

You really think we hurt him that bad?

Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.

Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!

No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.

The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?

Duke Forrest.

Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.

Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.

C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.

Sixteen times.

You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.

Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.

All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...

I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.

Same here. You can retire my number.

Be right with you.

No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.

But what about Major Houlihan?

N-n-no thanks, G-General.

You willing to b-back that up with odds?

I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.

We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.

Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.

Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.

And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.

So let's haul ass, Sergeant.

I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.

How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.

We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.

What do we do?

They're coming.

He can move in here with us.

That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.

There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...

No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.

Ayuh.

You're leaving tomorrow?

Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.

It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.

I didn't mean with me.

It happens to be a matter of life and death.

You think he won't.

I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...

I didn't have much choice.

Yeah!

Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?

I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.

I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.

Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.

Poker sounds great. When do you play?

Homosexuality.

You can cut the bow.

Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.

I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!

Yes, sir?

Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...

Stop that, O'Rielly!

Oh, get out of here!

I can try, sir.

I used to throw the javelin.

May I have the surgeon's name, please?

The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?

Now?

Yeah. Lavender and old lace!

You got me.

Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied

No, thank you.

No.

About me?

You were? I thought you were chasing me?

Look, Johnwhat we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a

Yes, sir.

A hundred dollars!

Mr. D. B. Norton!

No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.

You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor

Do you mean the speech you're writing?

What's that?

Oh!

John Doe.

That's all, Ned. Thank you.

Sorry.

Friend of his. They play duets together.

If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.

That's fine, honey. Now, get out!

That's

He's watching the other door.

Oh, let me go, will you!

Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.

Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?

The heelots!

Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?

No, sir. That spot under the bridge where we slept last night's good enough for me.

I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!

The elevators are still runnin'.

What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .

Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?

John Doe Club?

Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?

Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany!

You betcha.

You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.

Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.

How?

That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!

No.

Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.

No you won't! You're through deciding anything!

Did you write itor didn't you?

Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!

Did you want to see her about something important?

And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his gloveflopped into a chairand has taken out his ocarina.

Okay.

"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.

Yeah, okay.

You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.

Good. I don't want to be late.

It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.

This cousin of yours... What's his name?

Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.

Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?

Is that where you're family lives?

You want a convertible or hardtop?

Wait a minute, lemme see that.

Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.

Roper, we're into it...

Yeah.

You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.

Sorry... Habit.

A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.

Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.

Explain how that works.

Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?

I think so.

Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.

I'm not good at lying.

Thou shall have no other God before me.

So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?

A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.

I don't know why she'd pick him over you.

To run late!

Damnit!

Pull up alongside.

I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.

You've got to decide that for yourself.

Good question.

Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.

Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.

Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.

I was going to catch the last half on TV.

...Let me just show you.

A deeper level?

Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...

Your concern is heartwarming.

What kind of appreciation are we talking about?

I want to be put on this case.

Just that I'd talk to my superiors.

I need to take back what's mine.

-- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?

-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.

No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.

Because I took it out of your memory.

-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.

-- No.

Yes...

New York.

The weather.

Who?

-- Yes.

What?

The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.

It's not used for anything.

Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.

Why would I do that?

Where?

Cleaning up a mess.

-- You told me.

-- The inside?

Yes.

Realize?

Way you kiss me.

I know.

Not you.  A copy.

Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.

Male.

Billy, that's BRILLIANT!

If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!

They're called squirbs.

I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.

There should be a way to open it.

Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.

Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!

I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.

TRICERATOPS!

Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.

Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!

WE'RE OUTTA HERE!

Look closer.

Did I say anything?

Wait for me!

Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.

You forgot to say 'Simon says."

You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--

From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions!

Strength in numbers!!

And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!

And I ain't no nigger either!

But I've never served a day.

I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.

So what happened?

No. Not everything.

I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.

What's that divided four ways?

When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?

How's Bugsy doin'?

Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.

Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?

Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.

I'm already late.

It's too late.

You must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.

I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.

And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.

So what is the problem?

So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.

It's not myself I'm worried about.

Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.

Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.

What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.

Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.

You gotta plan these things.

Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.

Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?

Don, I'd be honored.

The name's Charlie.

I got partners.

I don't fuck my partners.

They do what I tell 'em.

Okay. I'm listening.

That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.

If it comes to that. Yeah.

Guess I'm just lucky.

One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.

But only on purpose, Tommy.

I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. And of course, I need not <u>add</u> -

I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.

Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.

I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?

Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.

Thank me next time you see me.

Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -

Why?

Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?

They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.

He called me "Doc."

Who?

<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!

It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.

When'd you get in?

You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!

No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.

Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?

Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.

Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--

Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.

Uh-huh?

I'm good.

Mother!

I don't want to talk about it.

Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?

Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.

At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.

Mm hmm.

Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.

Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.

Where's the Majority Leader?

Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?

Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.

It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!

I did not--

Never.

I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!

I'm saying I didn't sign it!

Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.

What for? Why, suppose there's a storm--all lines are down--how you gonna get a message to Ma?

I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--

That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.

That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.

Whadaya mean--*right*?

Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!

What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?

Who?

I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--

"There's more light here," he says--

Waiter!

I apologize.

Tonight?

Take me home, Diz.

I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!

Why me?

You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?

What is it?

Can't that wait, Hubert?

Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--

He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--

I *won't* send Horace Miller!

Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--

Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--

Is *what* getting me down?

Emma!

Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--

Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!

Look! There it is!

Oh, I couldn't tonight. Thanks a lot.

His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--

Good as new! It's quite all right--

Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--

Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!

The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!

I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!

Like what, Mr. Taylor?

What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?

You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?

Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--

Most natural thing in the world!

Yes--I think maybe you'd better.

Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--

Tonight.

I said--shall we get started *now* or--

Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--

I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."

Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.

It *is* not!

And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?

Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"

*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !

Oh--Saunders--

Hurray!

Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!

You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--

Well--I--

You're not going to take your *suit* off!

"So help me God."

I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--

Yes, sir--

You were about to recognize me, sir--

How's that, buddy?

Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.

Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--

Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 

Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--I need this job like I need ten pounds.

Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--

Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--

Oh, now--that won't do--

I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--

I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--

*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!

Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!

I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.

All right, we'll take Jeff with us--

Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.

Some people like it.

Deeds?

Sometimes twice.

Always.

Yes, indeedy.

No!

No! I resigned last week!

Yes, but I

Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .

What happened?

Oh - uh - nothing.

No. That is, I didn't  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.

Oh, I don't mind.

Huh?

That depends on what they see.

Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.

You can almost spit on it, can't you?

What's that?

Oh, that

What did he play?

Sure!

Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.

Let's just walk, okay?

Oh, hello darling.

I just couldn't stand seeing him again.

Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.

What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .

I was the world's sweetest ingenue.

I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.

Hurry up!

Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

Oh, yes sir.

I wanna see that guy!

Better wire him right away, John.

Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.

I'm not interested in the newspapers.

Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.

See you later, kid.

Okay.

Why, no.

He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to

I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.

Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.

A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.

How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.

Is Mr. Deeds in?

Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.

"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"

Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.

Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]

Oh.

He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.

Oh, they insisted on following me.

They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.

No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.

Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.

They can have the Estate.

Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.

But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?

Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.

I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?

Because it just isn't a business, that's all!

That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.

If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.

No, I mean - about my client.

Huh?

Oh. That.

And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?

One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?

No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters.

You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?

Yes?

Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I

Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?

I write poetry.

Binge?

You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?

Of course they're going to stay.  She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top?  Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.

South Dakota north.

South Dakota - but on the top.

Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.

What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.

Prairie? Oysters?

Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.

You have no pants, sir.

What two policemen?

Who?

Yeah.

An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.

I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.

How did they threaten you?

Mr. Cook.

Not any more.

How do you mean?

As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.

Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?

Now we're back on track.

-- Which I don't necessarily agree.

I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.

What do you do?

You've done well.

Yes, your honor.

I'd better get in there.

It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.

Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.

You like me. How come?

Doc.  Ainge...

You would have met in some shower eventually...

Sure I can, Lionel.

Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?

Don't need it.

That would explain it.

Is she a friend of yours?

-- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.

Hmm.

I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.

We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.

I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.

Is she against you getting help?

You've got a funny idea of funny.

Be specific.

Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.

So the headaches may not even be a part of this?

I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.

Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.

I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.

I don't know if --

I'm glad.

I don't follow you.

You're not the only one...

Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.

But...

I know it! Please believe me, I know that...

You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.

Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.

Good-looking woman.

Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?

Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.

This --

Yep.

It's just a thought.

You are Panda, monarch of modems.

No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.

Really?

Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.

I can tell you anything else.

Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --

Everybody has a story, Skip.

Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...

Who'd you go with?  That's not good.

All new people start with that...

"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?

What'd I do?

Yep.

Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.

By reading the Book Of The Dead.

In the desert? What for?

I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?

Sounds familiar.

Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!

Why do you like to fight so much?

You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.

You shall see.

When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?

Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!

No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.

And burn the map and retrieve the key.

You will not believe it.

For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.

Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!

What did you do to him!?

Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.

I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.

To be hanged.

I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.

Twenty.

The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.

I know my treasure.

He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.

I was mistaken.

Way to go, Evy.

Shut-up and get me off of here!

We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.

And it stinks to high heaven in here.

No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,

Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.

I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.

I know you knew I'd know.

Of course.

Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.

I'll be down in a jiffy.

Darling, you've got the wrong idea.

My father had this friend... He was an inventor...

When was that?

Then Captain Amazing appeared.

Do it, big boy!

Atta, boy!

The Inscrutable Six?

I can't.

Or even what it looks like.

I thought you'd never ask.

Thanks.

I got it.

Should I kill them?

You're nuts.

Against.

Frankenstein!

Really?

Curiosity.

Not tonight. 

Alone tonight?

Nothing wrong with being a waitress.

Monica!

I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?

Yeah yeah -- and that, too.

How could I see him if he's invisible?

But there's still only six of us.

He's got the fact that he's Superman!

Because that's what it is.

But look at him... and look at us.

I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.

Like what? Cutting off my own ear?

Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!

We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 

Looking for... the TV Guide.

Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.

But... the silverware?

We take the licks and he gets the chicks.

But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.

I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.

Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?

For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.

And, what a delightful idea!

I think it's absolutely charming.

May I come to the map?

Are you serious?

Any cannon?

I'm not insulted.

The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.

I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.

That is incredible.

Yes, sir.

Thank you, sir.  I will do that.

A glass of champagne, please.

Ah, Didier -- you are alive.

I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.

No, sir.

My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.

Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.

Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.

Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?

Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.

No...

And you, Junot?

You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.

You must not act impetuously.

But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.

And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.

Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.

No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.

Yes.

Promises mean nothing.

Yes.

Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.

There's probably some explanation.

I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.

Certainly.

Why not?

What are you talking about?

Yes?

Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.

If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.

Oh, then you are...

Of course, my dear.

No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.

Eugene de Beauharnais.

Yes, sir.

Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.

It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.

With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer.

Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?

Never...  But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.

I don't know!

Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.

I'm his cousin.

You know what he mean, dude.

Not me.

I said shut up!  Now who sent you?

I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.

Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.

Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.

That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.

You don't know Baby D.

I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?

You already in.

That ain't gonna work.

I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.

Naw, you go first.

I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.

Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.

Oh yeah, why you walking?

Hell yeah, I remember you.

Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.

Why didn't she put'em out?

Okay.

Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?

Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?

Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife stays here, of course.

Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.

I'll remember.

Come on.

Excuse me?

Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?

You could sell your Beamer.

Let it go!

Where's Craig?

Bite his ear!

Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?

That ain't gonna work.

I'll take you later.

Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.

The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.

Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.

I threw my back, again.

That's my girl.

Business.

Huh?

What?

Ah.

I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.

For not believing you.

Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.

Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.

What's your point?

Tell me why he's dead.

You fucked up.

Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.

Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.

He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.

No...kisses to you.

Keep it.

I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...

That's right.

What are you going to do?

You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?

I don't think so.

No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference.

My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?

I've done much better ones than this.

Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.

Go ahead, sugar Die.

Yeah.

Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --

And I won't never tell about the money.

Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.

No.

She went.

You have all sinned!

Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.

You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.

How do you mean?

Say what, Walt Spoon!

May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!

Sshhh! He's in there.

It's awful soon after Ben's passing.

It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!

She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.

How?

Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?

Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --

She's gone to Moundsville.

Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?

Hush, Pearl. Come on.

John, where are we g --

That's Daddy!

Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!

Dead.

About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.

Is that all?

Getting Pearl to bed. I --

Under the stone in the floor.

Tell me another secret about my Dad.

All right.

It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.

She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.

He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.

Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.

No, Harry! I thought --

I -- no, I --

It's not in the river, is it Harry?

How'do.

She took them kids with her?

Them kids!

Not this time! It was just one youngin -- a little boy babe. And do you know who he was, children?

When did I ever?

I sure as hell hope so.

Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?

Get the kit!

Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.

Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?

Uh-oh...

They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.

You do?

You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...

It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep.

You know he's dead though, right?

Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.

Uh, she just saw you, sir...

'Anything funny' like what?

Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.

It wasn't that serious...

You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.

Great

S'curity.

We should get her out of here...

Nobody's gonna kill you.

You were screaming like crazy.

Well then how can you say somebody else was there?

I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...

Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?

No more fights.

Have you any money?

Naturally, Comrade.

A few friends... just a little dinner party.

I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.

I see.

Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.

As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.

Evening gown?

Just for the honeymoon.

Positively not!

That's right.

I can tell you exactly.

Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?

We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.

Yes, he looks like a comrade!

And they might believe her in Moscow.

That's right... and we might as well face it.

And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.

Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.

Which part of the room is mine?

Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.

With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.

We have opened a restaurant...

That's all right.

Shall I draw your bath, sir?

Good evening, Monsieur.

Go to bed.

I don't feel like any breakfast.

If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.

Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.

General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?

Yes.

Certainly.

Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.

It's a real Paris reunion.

Get out of here!

I'll send you a muff.

What did she say about me?

Just three people in a room this size? Whew!

Yes, monsieur.

She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!

Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?

No, thank you.

I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.

Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.

Even the swallows are back.

Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....

The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.

We did our utmost to have it set ahead.

That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.

She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.

Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?

You're going to force us... huh?

Why should I take a chance?

Gladly.

I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.

Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.

Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.

A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!

You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!

Please don't misunderstand me...

Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.

Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.

Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?

Thank you. Thank you.

You know I want to...

I don't like your following me.

But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.

Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...

A wonderful idea! Radio or records?

I don't think so.

From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.

A funny story?

No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?

Darling, darling... please!

Comrades! Good people of France!

No. Nobody will find us.

All right, we'll make it red.

Yes... a kiss... salute!

They belong to the people.

Please.

Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.

Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!

No.

A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?

I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?

I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.

Has done what?

It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon.

I must ask you to leave.

Madame, if you...

If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?

Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.

I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.

What do you want?

Yes, it does.

May I ask why?

Yes... leaving immediately.

That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.

Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.

Where is that?

Where is it?

You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.

But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...

Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.

Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.

Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...

You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...

Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?

I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit.  Goldwater put it right.  He said: "Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here.  If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course.  That's the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility.

No, we have nothing to hide.

Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.

I'll bet he would.

Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.

How so?

Yeah?

Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.

Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.

Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.

He wants money.

No, sir.

Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...

No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.

Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.

This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.

Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?

I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President.

It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --

There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.

I don't know anything about that.

I know it well, sir.

We were working on China.

Silence!

That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?

All right.

I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.

He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.

Jesus!

Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.

It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...

What?

He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.

Yes, Mother ...

Did he have to die for me to get it?!

What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.

What ... ?

You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...

I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.

What?

My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.

It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.

But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.

It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?

Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.

If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.

It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.

How about you?  Are you going to win?

Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!

He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.

It won't.  As long as I'm here.

We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.

Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.

That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.

What do you mean, Jack?

But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.

Yeah ...

They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.

Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.

Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?

Did you cry when he died?

How did he do that?  All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much?

Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.

We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.

But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.

Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?

Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.

That'll be the day.

One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.

... but it was all we had.

Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.

Uh, is your mother ... still alive?

Yes, I understand that.

And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!

The hell with 'em.

Well, we could delete it.

I know ...

You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.

No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.

Not that.  Us.

Is that the truth?

He doesn't want me at the funeral.

I don't want them to love me.

I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?

Lost.

Whatcha mean by that?

Who else'd be in your truck.

What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.

I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.

If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.

Try "old" on for size.

I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.

Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?

You ain't heard from him?

Some pretty bad people.

Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.

Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.

So when was he here?

Sir, I don't want to picture that.

There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.

Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?

No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.

Natural to the line of work they was in.

Hyah!

I ain't got the money.

At the gettin' place.

You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.

Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.

Well -- how come?

Things happened. I can't take 'em back.

I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.

Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.

You know what's goin' on?

What makes you say that?

No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.

I know where it's going to be.

You mean the nature of this conversation?

Where does he work?

Is Llewelyn there?

I need you to step out of the car, sir.

Not a bleep.

No me mate.

Huh? Airport or airstrip?

Well -- where ya goin'?

I don't need to talk to you.

Yes.

Sixty-nine cent.

I don't know. Will there?

With what?

Sir?

You married into it.

Call it?

Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.

Everything.

Uh-huh.

Somethin' like that.

That's twenty-six dollars.

Okay.

No sir, it's unusual.

I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.

When did you last see him.

You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?

If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.

How well do you know Chigurh.

Yes?

The what?

I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.

I got beers in my room.

I do like you.

What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?

I'm retired.

I'm a welder.

I didn't say braze.

To kill your wife.

No I don't have it.

I don't know. American citizens.

Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.

BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?

GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?

C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...

It's fine. Mind your own meal...

You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...

Yeah?

I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...

We think we know where Betty is.

That's a nice name for what you need...

No, I was just... How you doing?

Oh. How come?

I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.

Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.

I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.

This is really awkward...

Umm... yes. Back home.

Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.

I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.

All the time...

Do what?

I take it I should. I'm sorry.

I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.

Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.

You're late, Eric.

Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...

She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?

Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...

Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.

Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?

What do you mean? What did I do to you...

...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...

What's so special about it?

No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?

You did? Was it anyone that you...?

Ahh, look, right now's not very...

I begged him to let me put that on!

I'd slap his face.

Really?

Man, that is love.

The one you were telling me about?

Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...

Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?

What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.

David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...

How many men have I talked to?

He is real.

To a party in the Hollywood Hills.

Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...

No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...

How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...

Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.

The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.

My socks?

Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?

I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?

Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?

A mark, huh?

...that's a good motto.

...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...

We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.

Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...

Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.

I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!

She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...

Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.

What do you mean?

Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.

No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...

If it helps bring her back, be my guest...

Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...

It is, if you like idiots...

He's waiting...

I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.

I'll think about it.

I said I'll think about it.

Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.

Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.

You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...

Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.

The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --

Yeah. Why, you know him?

Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?

David Ravell.

I swear to God!

No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...

"A Reason to Love."

You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.

Gopher, Everett?

Good Lord, what do we do?

Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.

What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?

Where's Tommy?

Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!

Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.

Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.

Wipin' little circles with his bread.

Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.

Vernon T. Waldrip.

Not out the other side his face, though.

Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.

No weddin'.

- in the gods - Huh?

Not your...

You said -

Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!

Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!

The hell you say! Wash is kin!

It was in his bureau.

That don't make no sense!

Million point two.

Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.

...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...

I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!

Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.

Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.

Yes, sir.

I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.

What for?

You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.

Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.

That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.

I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.

That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?

I wrote. Not every week...

Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.  Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!  No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!

A long time ago.

No, sir!

Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!

Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.

Yes, sir!

Well, goodbye.

I called you Sarge.

No.

No, sir.

Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!

Zack, don't!

I said, come here!

What are you tired from?

I'm a little late, that's all.

What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.

Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.

Come on. Let's go dance.

I got my foot on the floor.

I haven't made up my mind.

No way... Would you?

That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.

Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.

No, and I'm not looking for one either.

To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.

You're a very pretty girl, Paula.

Where'd you learn to fight like that?

Be a friend. Leave.

Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?

I'll get it if you want.

Does it still hurt?

I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...

When I'm good and ready.

Are those for me?

So?

Why'd he do it?

Why?

Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.

I can't risk it.

Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.

Naw.

No problem, but who's Susan?

I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...

I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?

Not with me.  Not with people.

She didn't.

Hurry up, for Christ's sake!

That's their problem.

You finish.  Then we finish.

Not that one.

Keep your voice down.

Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?

Yeah.  Kidnapping.

Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?

I did.

They're gonna die in there!

Huh?

No ball, kid.

Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.

It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.

Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --

Don't!

It's okay, Raoul.

No fucking way.

Why?

PANIC ROOM!

I don't know, why?

I am.  I'm here.

I'm here.  I'm here.

Come on, come on...

I was trying not to tell you...

Huh uh.

What if I keep dropping?

Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.

But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!

I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.

What are doing with yours?.

I tell you "officer", it wasn't...

Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?

No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE WANT?

Brimmer! Could you come in here please?

Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, "By any means necessary."

Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!

Well don't go forgetting your friends.

Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.

Man, fuck you!!!

Look this is bull...

Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.

I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?

You talk as if this thing's already been decided.

I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.

You mean...

The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...

You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.

I'm down.

What, I don't know how you mean?

You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.

He had a feeling you'd be coming by.

S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station.

Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 

What are you saying?

Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.

Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...

Late summer.

It worked.  How many men can you raise?

His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.

Pride will do.

He's not making light.

Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.

Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.

Goodbye.

First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.

Apology accepted.

Oh?

I will do so as soon as possible.

Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.

I consider them linked.

Prisoner exchange.

Are you going to meet with him?

Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.

Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?

The middle colonies?

When you have children, I hope you'll understand.

It's safer if we stay together.

Yes...  ... father.

You know how old I am.

Father?

We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.

What?

Granted.  Where are you going?

You know what happened.

Please.

Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.

I stand corrected.

That's five, keep going...

Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.

When?

So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.

You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?

How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?

I'm sorry, I didn't know.

Goodbye, Harry.

Robert.  Robert E. Lee.

Thank you.

That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.

I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.

For what?

About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.

He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?

Earned.

But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.

But father, they might come this way.

I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.

You'll see soon enough, hon.

Yaay!

In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.

I will. Come and kiss me.

Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...

I know.

Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!

And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...

I swear.

Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?

Allman Brothers.

Sure.

Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.

Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.

Yes.

I don't know.

Does she love the cat?

Then come on.

Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.

Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.

Why? For God's sake, why?

No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.

Your cairn.

Don't worry about that.

Yes.

Well...a touch of the flu...

It's Ellie's cat.

Shit! Look at this mess!

The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.

Remember.

According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.

Yes, I guess I do.

Louis, are you sure?

You'll get it back.  Or one better.

She.  Goes.  Free.

Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.

You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.

Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.

That so?

Aye, for us there is.

Or you could surrender.

Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.

I want you to leave.  And never come back.

Very well.

Did you, now?

Then why aren't you eating?

Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.

Commodore, you can't do that!

Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.

Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?

Truthfully -- you were a bit late.

-- then we never would have met.

No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.

Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!

Not when you can drink instead, at least.

What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.

One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --

I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.

That he is.

Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.

Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.

We're not going to just surrender!

You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.

I said, no lies.

By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.

They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?

Pirate.

No.

Somewhat.

And you want to turn pirate yourself?

We need to go!

Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.

That's not true.

It's not true my father was a pirate.

He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--

This way!

My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!

The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.

Yes, I have.

Where did he come from?

Bleak.  Very bleak.

Until he's done.

If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.

Do you know what I see?  I see man making his own clouds.  I see man coloring his own sky, and like this garden it is a site that makes my heart sing.

Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.

A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.

It's ready now, I know it is.

Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?

Why are there two ottomans?

Cleaned up?  It can't be cleaned up! Without the nanobot the waste can't be stabilized!  That's what we've been trying to tell you!  The only thing we can do is run!  Run!  Run!

That might work.

You have no idea what this is doing to your body.

What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?

The replicators?

Who isn't?

It's Sim.  We're almost there.

Been out for six months now.

I guess I should be flattered.

You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?

Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.

The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract.  We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.

What?  What's wrong?

What about it!

And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!

Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...

On the counter.

You didn't think I could just leave you?

We don't have time to argue, Susan.

I have to!

I remember I was trying to help...

I'm real touched.  Now get your Sunday's on.  We're going for a ride.

Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.

It's a miracle.

And you have him?

While you remain on the staff at Argon Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon's priorities.  I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl like you to figure out.

Yes - Sing Sing.

I don't mind her if you don't.

No - give you another guess.

How-di-do.

Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.

You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.

When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?

Of course I am Stewart.

Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live

Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!

Gallagher!

Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.

Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?

That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.

Stewart!

I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.

Huh?

Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.

Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.

Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.

A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "

Yeah?

I'll bite. What's the catch?

Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.

Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.

You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.

Yeah?

I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.

Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.

Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.

Dawson, sir.

Oh no, sir!

and that

I hope you'll be very happy.

Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?

I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?

No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.

Right!

I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?

All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?

Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.

We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.

Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and

Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.

Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.

That's putting it crudely, but

I beg your pardon.

It's all right. Bring him in.

Hello, Joe.

The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.

Double strength!

"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"

Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...

With pleasure, Madame!

Now the lady said you may go

Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?

Me, sir?

No, sir.

Yes, sir.

Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.

Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.

Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.

What do you mean?

Yes.

We're in Pleasantville?

No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.

In my handbag.

What?

Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...

Oh, George ...

Gosh. I hardly know what to say.

No. What?

No. Of course not.

Yes I did.

Yes I do.

Still doesn't make it right.

Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?

Oh sure it is.

What?

Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.

Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.

I like--really need a cigarette, too.

Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.

They don't have that kind of potential.

... Yeah.

Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.

I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.

Oh ... Right.

Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.

Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.

You know, we didn't call any TV repair.

Nice ... Nice ...

That's right.

Ooomph?

What the hell's going on!

Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.

Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?

Why?

Why don't you just take me back without it?

I don't know ... Three, four weeks.

Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.

What?

Yeah ...

Just listen to me ...

I brought you something ... From the library.

I'll never be able to do that.

Yeah ...

You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.

You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.

I don't know...I mean: I don't know.

Somewhere in Utah.

I'm just stopping by to say hello.

There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.

She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.

I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.

So it's ok if I bring her.

....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?

Hello everyone.

I'm not, I'm very happy.

It's fine, but --

I feel really on the spot now.

I don't do that. I don't - things like that.

OH MY GOD. Look at that.

Call me later.

Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?

....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?

-- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.

Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?

I'm just laying on my bed.

Are you watching a porno movie?

Yeah? So what are you doing, then?

What do you mean it doesn't matter?

I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....

Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?

You sound very cute, very nice.

Georgia.

You're going to work now?

Yeah.

You don't even know how much it is.

....what....?

No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....

They don't get opened until eight.

Ok.

No. I'm the exact opposite --

It's terrible, no.

Sure.

Ok.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Did something happen; are you alright?

If you come to Hawaii --

What do you mean?

It's Barry.

Yes.

Yeah.

This is nice.

You can't do that.

Well who did?

Why?

Yeah, but I didn't do anything.

-- and this is confidential?

337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.

I haven't even told you what's happened. Your girl that you have that works there for you threatened me and two men just chased me -- extorted money -- DEAN Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't have anything to do with me - this is a legitimate bossiness.

....I have seven.

Fine, thank you.

Hey...Lance....can I.....

....yes.....

...it just....I don't know....I don't know.

Hi, Lance.

You should go on a trip.

I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?

Yeah.

What do you have in the house?

What is this, man?

You can't be late.

You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.

Yeah but I'm serious.

I'll see you there.

Can we maybe ask for more money on this?

You don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --

Nothing.

It's fine.

-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --

You ready?

No.

Ok.

Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory.

My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.

We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --

At your service, Count.

"With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"

We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.

His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.

Why not?

What? What've I done?

You'll hate me now, won't you?

Mustn't do that, sir.

It's not even noon --

What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?

Enough to discern its tenor.

And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!

More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.

Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --

Don't be absurd; it's only a play.

You always do.

Valcour. His chair.

Coulmier, you animal!

Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!

I know, because I felt it myself --

Why was it you never took her by force?

We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.

Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.

Of course.

I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.

All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?

A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.

He's sworn to obedience.

You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --

And my own.

Poorly.

Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --

I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.

Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.

The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.

What's that then?

It's only been described to me. In your books.

Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.

I am not a wealthy woman.

Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.

Very much.

I wonder sometimes.

You need to get outta here, Rapunzel

Sure

There's no call for that language-

How much?

Not for me.

Yes?

Sir?

Huh?

That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--

Telling stories.

Showing life

Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.

No, baby, those are the hands of a killer

Don't whisper it. Don't even think it

We're doing Hearst.

I expected more from you.

I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!

And when he looks up? What does he dream about?

K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I

YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY, REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE - - REMEMBER THAT?!

Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--

And they went to the stockholders in New York.

Thank you-

Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--

Get out.

Again.

Jesus

Spare me the aria, I know what you want--

We done?

I'm Christ

Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--

Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?

How can he embarrass you?

Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.

I want to believe you, LaMotta.

No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.

You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.

I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.

Yeah. Do me a favor.

You heard me, I said hit me.

What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...

You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.

What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...

I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...

What did Tommy say?

Well, that's what I mean.

You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...

What?

Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?

Does that mean...

Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?

What time is it?

At night?

You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.

Can you see it?

No.

Jake...

Who asked you?

What's that kissing on the mouth shit?

I took the kids to my sister's.

I got bored so I went to the movies.

You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.

What?

I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.

Are you drunk?

I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.

Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.

Don't make no difference no more.

Jake, sit down for a minute.

Never felt better.

He should.

Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.

Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.

Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.

He has it. Thank you.

I'll pull somebody out of Japan.

Jefferies?

But his leg!

Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.

You think I made all this up?

She -- was -- an -- invalid!

Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?

Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.

Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.

What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?

How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?

Oh -- I almost forgot!

He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.

Well, in the garage, back home, we --

That depends on who "they" were.

This is Doyle, Jeff.

I told you that --

If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.

Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.

With that cast on -- you don't.

You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.

I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.

Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.

I don't know what you mean.

I'm not ready for marriage.

She's all right.

Stella!

I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"

There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.

That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?

She pay you much?

Well, the salesman could be available soon.

Police?

You called the police?

I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.

Look!

Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?

Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.

Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?

I'm afraid it is, Tess.

Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.

Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.

Empty as a football.

Uh-huh.

That's good news.

Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?

I think it's enchanting.

Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?

Without any future?

There's nothing to see.

You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?

And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.

To get on home.

Not yet!

Women aren't that unpredictable.

I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.

Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --

I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.

But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.

I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?

Is he cleaning house?

It could be -- the knife, and the saw.

Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --

Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?

Phone number?

Two minutes.

Good luck, Buzz.

Jim Stark.

We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.

Smashed the front door.

You still want to go home, Moose?

Hold it, Jim.

That's funny!

I'm not hungry.

Shoot, Jimbo.

I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.

I don't want to learn that!

Have some cigars.

I think I know my son.

Really, Frank?  When was that?

He's just loaded, honey.

A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.

That's right!

Open it.

Do you hear from him, son?

Plato.

No.  I don't think so--

What?

Who knows.  Plato?

What's a chickie-run?

How'd you find me?  What's happening?

Wow!  Well now-there-then!

Your father!

Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?

Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?

All right, darling.

It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--

Goodbye, dear.

I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.

Grandma?

Leave me alone.

I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.

All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.

And they think they are protecting my by moving.

Pretty mixed up?

"If he could" what?  You mean your father?

Chicken?

Want me to imitate a stupid cop?

Yes, ma'am.

Where what was.

Won't mother be proud.

They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?

No.

Why?

I felt like it.

I don't know, but we can't stay here.

No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?

Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.

It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.

He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.

I don't think.  I know.  He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world.  He doesn't like my friends--he--

Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.

What?

YES!!!

I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!

Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...

That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.

C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.

Yeah.

I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --

Ash, you've gotten me enough --

And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?

We could live it up and --

NICK!

Nick, it won't work. It won't work!

You're not hearing me here --

If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!

Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!

But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.

What?

Nick, the ice is --

Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.

I'm almost done.

You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?

Is there any way you could get into his truck?

Yeah. That's love.

Rudy. How'd you know my name?

The hell I can't.

I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!

I shared his cell!

Bam Bam.

Nick don't talk till Nick gets something.

When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.

You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.

...never... tried...

I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum

What's the code?

We got five. Putting Ashley outside.

I'm no threat without a gun.

Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.

'Tis the season, convict.

Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!

Take 'em.

Mr. Bangs.

What?

Acid-chewer.

I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --

Five years. Since it opened.

How do we take them out?

You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.

DROP THE GUNS! NOW!

What?

Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.

No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.

Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.

YOU TELL HER!

And you set me up.

Who the hell made this map.

First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?

You're coming back to work for us, right?

You ain't dying, he is.

Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.

That's okay, Eddie, I do.

So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.

I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.

It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."

Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?

This better not be some Freddy joke.

...What bar?

Did the two of you talk?

The Milwaukee Brewers?

The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.

I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.

It's a change.

Sure.

Chew? Toby Chew? No.

Why am I Mr. Pink?

Give me my book.

That's your proof?

Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!

We think we got a rat in the house.

Down to my car.

No, I'm not!

It's not good...

I can' take you to a hospital.

The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.

A few cops.

Where?

Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.

For all I know, you're the rat.

We can't take him to a hospital.

Yeah, those guys too.

Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.

As far as -- Sonora?

Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.

Hold on.

I'll make the soap myself.

Will she be dark or fair?

That's fine.

Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.

All right -- it's said!

I suppose that's my fault.

That's right -- worry about your clothes --

Goodbye, Mary.

Why?

I haven't got the job yet.

I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.

Like what?

No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?

The thing to do is stick to rabbits.

Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.

Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.

That's right, Steve.

So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?

Nobody asked you to.

I don't care.

He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?

Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.

Just a thing I was workin' on.

You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?

Well, say it.

Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.

What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?

They shouldn't have done that.

I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.

That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --

And we're running out of that.

What's the use.

Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.

Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.

Where is he?

Put on another one.

Did someone say I wasn't nice?

Good night, Steve.

Unicorn -- a kind of animal --

Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.

Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?

And you've got me all figured out?

Steve --

Goodnight, Miss Wells.

Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.

Alex, what are you doing?

In room "302" at ten o'clock?

Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.

Hey, I have an idea...

It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!

He's so brave.

Then what kinda stuff can we do?

Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.

Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?

Alright!

Hugh Kane.

That we should take our friendship a little further?

Can you feel that?

Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --

Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.

Listen to me I --

I don't care. You pick.

What, you think I did this to myself?

But he'll kill her!

I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.

No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.

Not in a thousand years.

Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.

Yes!!!!

Alright, let's take a vote...

My child, you're alive!

Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.

Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.

Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.

I told you it would taste just like chicken.

That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.

Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?

Saw who?!

Let me see the files.

Any of them hot?

What's this?

No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.

Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.

Hi.

And sexy.

Oh, I couldn't do that.

Alright. Come on, you guys.

I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.

Alright, go to the belt store...

I guess so.

My holy water.

Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.

Shorty, why don't you say grace?

I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...

That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!

No more violence... No more violence...

Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.

Always the dentist.

Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!

Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.

That's right.

Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.

BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!

MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!

Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!

I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.

We can be real quiet...

Oh, honey!

Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?

Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?

GODDAMN YOU!

COCKSUCKER! 

I do, please.

Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.

Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?

I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!

Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.

Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?

Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.

Now, here's a babe!

I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --

Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -

Can we go there now?

It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.

You won't get any water and you won't get any rest. You may as well drink.

She can only use cash.

How much have you got?

She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.

I can't understand it at all.

"The Dante?"

What does she do with herself after business hours?

Thank you.

I did her hair.

No. She asked about the trademark.

Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging - waiting  I feel as if I'd never known her.

I saw him on the floor. He was cut -  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him  white  and the men holding him up between them.

He was a kind little man in his way  and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.

But you have treated me that way.

I'd like that.

Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.

Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.

We've tried so long to find her.

Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.

Gregory   you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.

I know  I shouldn't have told you

This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.

I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.

That you love Mary.

I'm afraid.

Why wait?

Good-bye.

Yes.

I have something even better.

Devil worshippers!

It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --

I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said - it fits in with what I saw - she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.

I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.

What a peculiar question.

Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet 	one as a detective.

It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.

I think it's time.

Cloven hoof?

It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.

One believes - it's like any other religion...

It seems right to us.

Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --

A gay lot - Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...

We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.

No, she's with her sister,

Yes  and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline.

Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.

That's too bad.

Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna -

When?

It won't hurt.

What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.

Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.

I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.

Sister older or younger?

What's the first?

No.

How do you mean?

Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.

Well, let me put it this way: I cannot achieve an erection while in the presence of another person. So, for all practical purposes, I am impotent.

I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.

Well, I wasn't always impotent.

Basically, yes.

That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?

What kind of personal project?

Who's Donna?

You went out with her?

All of these are interviews?

Why not?

The... interviews are about sex, Ann.

Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.

Maybe you want to go.

She said it on her tape.

What difference does it make why I do it?

At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?

Yes.

You said you weren't always impotent.

So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?

Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.

God, I m so mad at him!!

That's very flattering.

Why not?

I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.

You did that?

Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?

That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.

Are you having an affair?

Is that supposed to comfort me?

Always the lawyer.

Isn't therapy helping at all?

I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.

Yeah, so?

I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.

Is he still at your house?

Did you find him attractive?

Do you have to say that?

Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.

Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.

I have a pretty good idea.

But he won't.

He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.

Let me talk to him first.

And... do whatever it is you do.

What's wrong with that?

Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?

Well, what? Is he dangerous?

Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?

So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?

I don't want to discuss it.

What is it?

Did you take your clothes off?

She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.

That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.

No.

No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.

When I was fourteen.

Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.

Yes.

How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?

Could be risky.

Cynthia. John.

I like the way he dresses.

I wish you hadn't done that.

What do you mean?

It hurts that you would say that to me.

By definition you're lying to Ann, too.

Did he put you up to this?

I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.

I'm not going to give you my keys.

Yes?

Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!

Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.

I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.

We live in 703.

Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?

But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?

I don't get it.

OK. I'll think about it.

Huh?

BREAKING OUT

A wreck.

On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.

After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?

WELL FIRST YOU GO RIP RIP RIP THEN YOU GO SNIP SNIP SNIP THEN YOU WHIP IN A ZIP ZIP ZIP AN' YOU SPLIT IT UP TO THE HIP HIP HIP AN' AS YOU STRIP STRIP STRIP YOU QUIVER AND SHIVER FOR THAT SOFT CARESS AS YOU SLIP SLIP SLIP...INTO THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS

Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.

No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.

Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.

Everything's free there.

...closed?

It pays to know your way around, Oliver.

Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...

Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.

SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT

Shove it, Ralph!

I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE

SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS

SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT

Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'

Sure thing.

Absolutely correct.

Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.

Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.

YOUNG BLOOD

But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?

Flavors!

I don't think he intends to go that far.

Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?

Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.

And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.

OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...

Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?

Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?

Huh.

Yeah, I'm here.

You know me. I love it up here. How about you?

A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?

If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.

I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.

Good. How're you?

Me too.

Maybe. Recognize this?

Well, in that case...

You said you had it all lined up.

I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.

It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.

I'd rather have a knife.

Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.

I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?

Huh.

When do we get to drink it?

It's not even a mile.

If that's what feels right.

She works for tips!

Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.

Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.

I want to go home now.

I'm a quick learner.

With Maya?

Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?

If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!

Shut up. Shut your face.

Count me out.

Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.

Deep.

What? Of course I like Christine.

Yeah.

You're an asshole.

They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.

I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.

Hey, asshole! That's not cool!

Is what the money thing?

You have to tell me --

Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.

You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.

Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.

Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?

You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.

Huh. Let me think.

What?

Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.

Yeah.

Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.

Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.

Hold on.

I'm fine. You rest.

You said it looked like a car accident.

I'll pay for it.

I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.

Why don't you come in?

So I'll see you at the rehearsal.

I know. I love that.

Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.

How long have you been into wine?

What was the bottle that did it?

Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.

Um... yeah but it's more...

Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.

Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.

Got it.

Okay.

But you wanted to fuck me first.

Yeah.

A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.

Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.

Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.

This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.

Quaffable but far from transcendent.

Exactement!

Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.

It tastes old.

She doesn't answer me either.

I heard them Morgan.

My ballet recital.

That's weird.

I don't feel much.

...I will.

What?  Colleen?... Colleen?

I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.

This is not an intelligent way to approach this.

Curse and stuff.

He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.

I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?

It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?

Yes.

What's furry, furry rabbit?

We have to go in the basement.

Have they said anything about our area?

Don't.

Edgar, come inside.

We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.

Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.

Don't call me Father.

Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.

No.

Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.

Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.

There's nobody coming?

Is he alive?

They've been kind to me.

I just came out to say goodbye.

Yeah... that must have been it.

This is a brutal land.

It's one thing to know it...

Ten A.M.

I haven't done anything.

Where's Turley?

Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.

I'm going to California with my brother.

Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.

Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.

I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.

Believe it.

The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.

I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.

We didn't get that far.

What now?

Let's get out of here.

Howdy.

We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.

Who did it?

It's none of your business.

Rae, I need help.

Shut up. You need help, don't you?

I just got to town.

So we understand each other?

What's she got to do with it?

Stella.

Me too. What's wrong with us?

I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.

If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.

I like your attitude. But it can be risky.

You better get in there with her until this thing is over.

Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.

Who?

It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.

I am telling the truth.

You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.

Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.

I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.

We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.

Excuse us.

As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.

-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.

Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?

Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.

Everyone you know is lying.

Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a good time.

Viktor, you should have said something.

You're so good to protect her like this.

She said you were very beautiful.

Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?

No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.

You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?

Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.

Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.

Well, I --

... so much like her?

You don't secretly want the attention?

How about the nudity?

Clyde.

It was more in passing.

-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --

How did the wall get there?

I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?

I know what you mean.

-- Please, get away from me.

-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.

Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.

Hello, Lainey.

I do.

I read.

If anyone asks about Simone --

Precisely.

I know.  Thank her for me.

Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?

What?!

Max Sayer -- National Echo.

Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.

-- I bet you have.

I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.

24-hour tail on Taransky?

Yes.

But that's Simone's part.

Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.

No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.

Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?

Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.

I didn't leave you.

Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.

Dr. Crowe.

Look over there.

That I'm a freak.

I forgot myself.

Dr. Crowe.

You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.

Me too.

Will you stay here till I fall asleep?

And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?

I don't know.

When?

Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.

Yes, it did.

You do?

I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.

Got it.

Cole, please stop.

They were the ones who hanged everybody.

S-ssstop that!

Chuck E. who?

Oh yeah? Why's that?

What's a "little while?"

Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?

Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.

No shit.

Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.

Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.

Shotgun. Suicide. Next?

Nah. We still got Billy Bob.

Metaphysical question, man.

"-- an AXE!"

Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.

I'll be fine here.

I don't think so.

Who? Us?!

Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.

Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.

When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...

I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.

You never had trouble communicating before.

I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.

You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --

You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...

Spider.

What a surprise. -- What about our audition?

Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.

CARL??? Carl did this?!!

Why bother?

That's not funny.

I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.

Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.

I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?

He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!

Okay.

That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.

Think we should get up a search party, head in there?

We're coming your way, man!

The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.

What do you see? I see a butterfly.

Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.

I got to leave my post.

Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.

Brought you munchies.

What can I do you for?

I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.

Out.

Okay.

It's just one of my students, Grant.

What other stuff?

And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?

America's bored.  Now, what do you want?

Last year, this was a new rig.

How much style?

They're both a challenge.

You know, you're not a bad passenger.

Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.

Eleven.

Enjoy your Kenworth.

Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.

Ummm?

Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.

And?

Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.

You gotta admire the man's determination.

I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.

I don't know, man. Ask him?

Two is one.  Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass.

Redneck heaven.

Can a pig whistle?

What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.

We're gone.

Now what?

I'm here.

What's that, pardner?

Yeah, but...

But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.

Go breaker.

Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?

Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.

I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.

If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.

Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.

Chickenshit money.

Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.

All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.

Yeah.

Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --

Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.

Yeah.

You shot me and murdered my friends.

Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.

The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.

Shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell after Hitler... I like your chances a lot more.

Your attitude sucks.

Only if you really, truly mean it.

-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --

They what? What? No. No. Why?

His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.

You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?

Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.

What are you doing here?

-- will be handled back in --

-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.

...He does now...

So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.

Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --

Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.

But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?

No... We're trying to save Heller.

I don't see it like that at all.

I'm here.

-- he's doing it then, huh --

-- okay, g'head --

Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.

Yeah, I can front this.

None whatsoever.

Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?

-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.

Got hit twice.

'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.

A Fed? Like FBI?

I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.

The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.

You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.

Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."

No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --

Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...

Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--

Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit, the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout, tap-dance "show us your shit" thing neither -- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya.

What's the time frame?

In the lab.  With her, probably.

Why did you agree to come here?

No, she won't.

What?

That depends.

My wife.

Will she come back?

I wish you'd told me.

What is it?

Not necessarily.

But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.

She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --

I'll be right back.

Yes.

And tonight?

Stop it.

Rheya.  Not here.

Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.

You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?

I did too.

I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.

I think so.

I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.

Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.

You don't love me.

That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.

Yes.  Especially toward the end.

You... she said I didn't love her.

No.  I love you.

Do you?

It's all right.

You're lying.  I'm not human.

Then you'll die.

Thank you.

I want you here.

Yes, you are --

Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.

I want to stop taking those pills.

I can't --

Am I really her?

Please.  Don't.

It's an experiment.

And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.

Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?

It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.

You still writing the occasional magazine article?

It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...

Can we go then?

There's a phone in the car.

I got money.

Hey!  There are crazy people here.

If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.

Big talk... Desperate guy.

Hmm...

How did you know?

They're kind of fuzzy.

No kidding.

Claire...!

This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...

Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --

Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.

No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.

Mike...?

I don't know...

Not if you don't want me to.

Just putting in an appearance then.

Claire...

Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --

Nothing.

I don't know Tommy.

Absolutely.

What?

I think television's a dangerous thing.

No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?

She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.

I'll be right up.

It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!

D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?

Me neither.

It should've been me...

Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.

It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!

I just gotta talk to her, T.J.

Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.

That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...

I brought the girl.  She's outside.

I'll prove it!

She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.

Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!

I'm not lettin' no one go.

I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.

What the fuck you doin'?!

Lay back, Mack.

We're gonna pass the street.

At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.

Be nice.

Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?

They'll never take me alive.

Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.

I know.  I've got one too.

Don't be pitiful.

Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--

Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.

Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know, sexy stuff.

Gimme that.  Pick it up later.

I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--

Just call me Spidey.

What if you get hurt?

I-- uh--

"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."

That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.

Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.

Oh, God, I forgot to--

I'm here...

Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?

Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.

And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--

It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?

Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?

--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.

Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--

Yes.  Do you have a date?

Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--

Aunt May, what happened?

Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?

Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--

I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--

Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.

I don't think I'll be running into him.

Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?

The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?

And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?

Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.

Bonkers.

No, no!  Not there!

Any news on Dunbar?

Static!

That'll do.

Who is it?

Who is it?

Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?

Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?

Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?

We're looking at it.

Everybody but Joey, and you know who.

Twenty-five.

Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.

Sefton!

Not you.

Yeah.

That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.

Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?

Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.

Abfuehren!

They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?

The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.

What exactly is he charged with?

Isn't it?

Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.

It's a mouse trap.

Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!

They'll shoot you, Animal!

What's the award?

He's the grrrrreatest!

So what? There's other women!

So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.

Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?

Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.

You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.

Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.

Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?

Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?

Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?

What time?

The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.

Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?

Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!

Yeah. We were just passing out guns.

Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!

Just don't drool on it.

Oh! Somebody was peeking!

HoS qorDu. 

We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.

Full disruptors.

Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.

Twelve years, sir.

But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?

No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.

Agreed.

During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.

It appears to be a magnetically sealed.

I hope so, sir.

The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.

Beam them directly to Sickbay.

But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan.

You're in the Nexus.

Please, please.

Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.

Yes, yes, it is.

You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-

Better?

That's right.

Phasing? To where?

Where are the deflector relays?

I always do.

Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.

I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.

You want me to contact Starfleet?

No. Thank you.

They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird of Prey is any match for the Federation flagship.

You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.

Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"

In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.

Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.

Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.

There are no other ships in the system.

Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.

Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?

Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.

An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...

Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.

Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.

What did you see, Chekov?

Scotty...?

Locate.

On screen.

We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!

It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.

That may be difficult...

Not exactly.

Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.

Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.

Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?

Saavik... Is... David with you?

Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.

I think it's an energy form, sir...

Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.

Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?

Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --

Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.

As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...

Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.

Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!

Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.

"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!

... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.

But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.

But sir! Federation Starship approaching.

Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.

Wait!... Wait...

I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...

Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.

They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.

You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.

Good for you, Lieutenant.

All true.

I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.

For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.

Exactly. Happy birthday.

Thank you.

I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection.

Ah.

As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.

This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.

Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.

We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.

Young. I feel young, Doctor.

I have my orders.

I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.

Is that a poem?

I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.

Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.

Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.

We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.

Ssssh!

What do you want with us? I demand --

I'm Doctor Marcus!

How soon --

We'll beam aboard and stop it --

That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --

Is that what you came here to say?

Only half of you would get there.

It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?

Let them eat static.

Raise them --

Visual --

I shall avenge you --

I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.

Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.

KHAN!

All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...

Admiral --

Sensors, Captain?

I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --

My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.

Aye, sir.

Admiral, this is Spock.

Yes, SIR.

She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.

The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?

Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...

Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests --

Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --

At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...

The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...

Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?

Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...

I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.

Transmission jammed at the source, sir.

I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.

... No, sir. It has not.

You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.

You may ask, Lieutenant.

Who?

If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.

On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.

'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'

Three minutes, thirty seconds.

As you were, Mr. Saavik.

Stop engines.

Phasers locked...

We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.

Aye, sir.

I exaggerated.

Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.

Bob... it's tearing me apart.

Yeah.

I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.

Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?

Gillian --

We've done it before.

Would you prefer to do nothing?

-- That's the general idea.

Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.

What do you think, Spock?

Come on, Pavel...

... My shoes...

... My God...

That is what I said, Doctor.

Acceleration is no longer a constant.

"Guessing" is not in my nature...

How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?

Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!

Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.

I have the coordinates of the reactor...

Like what?

I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.

Shields, aye.

We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...

I suppose they told you that...?

I was not.

You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?

Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?

I buy that. What about him?

Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?

We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.

How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.

Just lucky, I guess.

What do you mean now?

Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.

Right.

But Kirk...

Mr. Sulu: full power descent!

Why does it have to be goodbye?

Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...

Surely you can be more specific...

Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.

Explain.

Yes.

Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?

Yes?

The hell I can't

No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.

In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.

Right.  Will you help us?

Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.

No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.

Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!

Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!

Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.

Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.

Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...

Picture, Uhura!

Aye, sir!

283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...

Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.

Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.

Mr. Sulu?

Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -

Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.

Sill? What else would I be working with?

Tell her I feel fine...

Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.

To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.

We've... just begun to.  I suppose you're seventy-five.

But not you.

You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.

More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.

It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.

I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.

... an offlander?

There are caves in those mountains.

I thought it might begin the healing process.

Perhaps, that is true.

No.

Yes. But look at this medscan...

Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...

I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...

He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...

Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?

Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?

It is not over.

... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...

We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.

This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...

You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?

There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...

The Ba'ku.

We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.

If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.

If we could lure him away from the bridge...

No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...

We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...

The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.

Fail-safe?

The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.

I'll be in Engineering.

Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.

Eject the core.

... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?

Commander Riker...

We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...

So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?

We're not going anywhere.

Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...

Worf, what the hell are you doing here?

Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...

No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...

No, sir. It is a gorch.

Is there any other way to disable the injector?

No children?

Or you could try lying down.

... I believe you...

Activating injector assembly.

They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.

Absolutely.

Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --

Yes...

It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.

Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.

It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...

I wish to... go back to the way I was.

Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.

I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.

I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.

Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.

How serious is the damage?

If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.

They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.  It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.

Tell her to go back to Resurrection.

Altitude fifty kilometers...

Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.

It'll be tight, but we should make it.

I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.

You don't sound French.

I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.

Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?

You're lying.

Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.

We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --

Aye, sir.

Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.

Fire.

Steady as she goes.

Go to manual.

Worf... torpedo... now!

In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.

I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.

Yes, sir.

What?

They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.

I'll keep that in mind.

Understood!

The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.

Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.

Where the hell are they going?

What kind of message?

You may need assistance, doctor...

You heard the order, Lieutenant.

Can you - ?

We've been set up all along.

We're not finished.

Bones, are you afraid of the future?

Don't remind me.

Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...

And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.

And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.

Now there's a poser.

In space, no one can hear you sweat.

You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.

They'll make it look like an accident...

I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.

That's a comfort...

I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?

Very much.

You feign ignorance?

You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!

Yes.

I have on occasion disobeyed orders.

Well, I -

I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.

Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...

Who else?

But if she's cloaked...

Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.

She programmed the torpedo hits?

Mr. Valtane, any more data?

Do we report this, sir?

Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?

Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.

There's a reward for your death.

We didn't kill Gorkon.

Possibly.

Candidate for what?

You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -

I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.

Sulu!

Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.

I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.

We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.

I am uncertain.

So, that's it..

What peace conference?

Why would they give them to us?

You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.

WE SURRENDER.

In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.

Confirmed, Captain!

I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.

Visual!

What is it?

Then someone forged a data bank entry.

Aye, aye, sir.

He's placing himself in a most awkward position...

At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.

Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?

But you didn't join a conspiracy.

I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...

No.

How long is that?

It'll serve you right.

He turned out all right.

Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...

On my way.

Good work. The download?

It'll only work for one of us.

They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...

Of you?

I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.

He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.

I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.

Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!

Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.

Negative.

You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.

Do you have a name, sir?

He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?

Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.



Why is it moving?

The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... Im a talking head.

The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.

As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.

I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!

I know how he thinks.

Make it so.

This isn't about me anymore.

Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.

I can feel your desire, Deanna.

Do you have life support?

Understood.

This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.

Aye, sir.

I'll take care of it, sir.

There's more... as always. He's Reman.

That will never happen.

Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?

If you don't mind.

Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.

On screen.

Your new chair, sir.

Counselor?

Away team. Transporter room four.

She's the most beautiful ship Ive ever seen.

When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.

Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.

Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.

And the Senate supports you?

You know I do.

I know.

You'll acquire a taste for it.

There is that.

I know.

I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 

What's this all about?

I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.

Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?

I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.

Long ago.

So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?

Please.

You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!

He's a very unusual android.

Yes, Praetor.

My time. I'll spend it how I choose.

Find her again.

Do as I tell you!

She is here.

They're holding position.

Praetor.

There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.

How much are your rooms?

We should have. Let me see.

He's got a gun!!

What the hell do you think you're doing?

Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?

It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.

Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?

Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.

What do you mean by 'contain?'

We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.

We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.

We don't know what else to do. We need results.

You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.

Washington thinks it's too late for that.

This is George Fox...

You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.

Which way do you want to go?

Ah no.

Good.

X...

We're going to have to stop for gas soon.

Gas good?

I am Jenny Haydn.

I know.

My... husband.

Shit?

You want to try it?

This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.

Yes.

No.

No.

Is that a baby?

Why?

'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?

You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike...  You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...

Can I have the gun?

It was a mistake.

I don't understand 'friend.'

Why?

I do not want to.

That was beautiful.

Yes. Sing some more.

No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.

I must meet my ship.

I can't stay on this planet.

Horses.

But...

I know how to gamble now.

Yes.

This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.

I understand.

You want the baby to laugh at me.

I must go.

I will.

What? No, of course not.

If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?

Pull over. I've got to get back there.

Get Fox.

Bullshit!

We better get it into the box. Come on...

It was a man though... right?

It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.

Judy, that's stupid.

Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.

I wouldn't think so.

I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?

A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?

Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.

What're you going to do?

Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.

A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...

Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.

You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--

Thanks, Max.

Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.

I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?

I'm on her.

He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...

So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.

Why me?

Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.

You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.

She never gave me a tape.

Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.

I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.

Sleaze to peddle.

No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.

Fumitsu.

Coming with you.

Let's talk in the car.

No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.

Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.

No idea.

Because Iris knew somebody was after her.

That's where it gets a little strange.

OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.

No shit.  You got someplace in mind?

Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.

It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.

The gas tank's going to go any second!

Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.

Uh unh.

And do what?  Take on his whole posse?

Then we'll be right where we are now.

Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.

Yeah.  We did.

See you downtown.

Just Lenny.

The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.

Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.

No, sir.

Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.

Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?

And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night.  Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?

She's buried.

Winona.

I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?

This is Agent Mackelway.

Hi. What's in the case?

You must travel a lot, huh?

Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?

He had an orange hat on.

What?

Another what?

What are you doing?

I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.

Then why do I still have a badge?

Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.

He got away. I had him. He got away.

Go ahead.

If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?

What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?

I was visiting an old college friend.

An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.

I didn't use Low's name.

I understand.

What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?

Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --

Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.

Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.

Not especially.

Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?

This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.

The man knew how to dress.

That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.

This is some serious shit.

I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.

And one other thing.

Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?

Don't be too harsh.

What did you tell him?

No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.

We did find these, however.

Sue Ann Hanson.

You did.

That's true.

You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.

And you're working with him?

I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.

Yes.

The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.

I already have an employer.

Something came up, Murman, my man.

[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]

[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]

[Not the heart, the watch.]

[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]

Four hundred and sixty, sir.

I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.

Yes, sir.

Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.

I talked to him.

Shuddup.

Yes. Like the quiche.

What what? What advantages?

Anything.

Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...

Oh. You know.

I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...

...and even then...

Hey, man. At least it's Disney.

What an asshole.

Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.

Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...

I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...

We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.

Six years.

Listen. I had a great time.

I would love to see you again sometime.

That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.

If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.

Hi, Mike?

Are you on the other line?

I heard you might be moving back...

Right.

What do you want? You're tall.

Kinda.

Well, until now. Tend the pin.

I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.

Sure. Kick me when I'm down.

I don't know. Eight or Nine.

What'd you get?

...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.

Classy.

Bud.

Well, let's hit that party.

..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.

You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.

Oh boy.

Well, that's dumb.

At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...

...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.

Make someone bleed.

So, what? Eleven?

He's trying to be an actor.

...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...

Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... 

Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.

S'up Trent?

What Vegas?

Be downstairs. You're beautiful.

I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.

I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!

Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!

Whu?

What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?

Well, you look money, baby. We both look money.

I know, but...

...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...

I'm just saying, not in this particular case.

Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?

Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.

You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.

Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.

They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.

Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.

Yes!

No! Not the camera guy!

Hold on.

I didn't even like her, to be honest.

She thought you were money.

Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.

Michelle went for you, right.

Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?

Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.

Yeah.

Yeah. You met him once.

...It's on.

You think?

...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.

Yes, I understand I'm listening.

Then make them suffer as she suffers.  How much shall I pay you.

America has been good to me...

You have to answer for Santino.

Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?

How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?

You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.

OK, but be careful.

No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.

You understand him better than anyone.

And with prison record.

They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?

I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.  He won't last out the night.

Tom said he'd take care of it.

For bravery.

No.

I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.

You wanted me to be your son.

A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.

How?

Where are you going?

Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.

And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.

Come Sunday morning:  My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.

You look good, too.

The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.

The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.

No.  Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.  Anyone know it.

Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.

Did he give you his politicians?

They're waiting to see my father.

Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.

Al Capone!

Michael, I love you.

I told you you wouldn't like him.

How do you do.

Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.

Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.

Goodbye.

Don't ask me.

You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?

You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.

How's Mom?

I can help you out...

Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.

Until the old man tells me different.

Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.

I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.

Christ, if I could only contact Luca.

To the city.

Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.

What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...

No.  I want things very calm for another six months.

He talked to you?

Is my credit good enough to buy you out?

You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.

Do you recognize my voice?

Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.

It's vile.

I don't like you.

Okay.

Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.

Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.

Say again?

That's funny.

Can you mix a martini?

What? What's this?

I love jazz.

What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.

See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.

Copy out from here...

No!

I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.

What club?

You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.

I'm prepared to take the blame.

To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.

Ripley's plans.

What?

So tell me.

Tom, I don't love you.

You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.

Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.

Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?

Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?

Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.

He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.

Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?

Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.

I'm fine.

Sure.

Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.

Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!

My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?

Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.

I can explain.

I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.

Why? When?

Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?

I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.

Do you know Tom?

No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.

Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.

Emily.  Just kidding.

As in the...?

How did you know that?

I know.

Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.

I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?

You know what -- I am.

He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.

I can't later.

Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.

But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...

No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --

A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.

Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate.

No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!

Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.

I'll fix some drinks.

It's okay.

You try. You try talking to her.

All kinds of things. Making plans.

Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.

Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?

You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.

Yes?

Postmortem?

November, I thought.

November 7th is my information.

Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.

I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.

Huh?

Yes, mam.

I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.

It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.

Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.

I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.

Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.

I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.

The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.

Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.

It keeps ya busy.

I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.

Oh. Who was that again?

He'll, what else can I do with it all?

I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.

Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.

Sure.

The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?

You forgot "sexy".

Just didn't get around to it, huh?

Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.

More people watch it.

I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.

This is gotta be a game, right?

Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...

I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.

With the other hand, right?

Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.

Could you see anything?

You said that?

Stick up?

Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.

Iris.

I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.

I can leave anytime I want.

I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.

That's not hard to do.

Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?

He shoots dope too.

Besides, I've got to stay here.

Cops don't do nothin.

I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.

My work may take me out of New York.

Damn straight.

Why?

What's going on?

Iris?

Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?

Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.

Yeah?

Yeah?

Thanks.

Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.

For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.

No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?

I'm not the chemical weapons expert.

I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.

Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.

Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.

I wish you were coming with me.

Damn...

And  I love you, Pete!

Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.

No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?

Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...

Oh.

Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.

Oh.

Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.

Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.

Guess I must've learned.

Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?

We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?

I do.

A statement?

I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.

I... I need a drink of water.

Well, son, you're home!

No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?

When did I leave?

Can't wait.

Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.

Oh.  What... what time is it?

They're...

Yes.

Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.

The film broke...

It's possible.  I just don't remember.

Wish I could say the same thing.

Huh?

I was decorated.

Yeah, well, that's enough.

And I won't be a communist anymore.

It's wrong, Leo.

Not any more.

Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.

Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it "heaven music."  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.

No.

Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me.

We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?

Yeah... me too.

I thought you...

'Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it?

No.  Absolutely not.

The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.

No, not really.

No. Just a few hours.

Yes.

Yes, I did.

Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...

No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.

How'd you happen to come here?

Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.

What do you mean?

Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.

Afraid I'd give Mitch.

Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?

Cathy!

I don't know yet.

I guess it does get a little hectic at times.

She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.

Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?

The little Brenner girl.

Morning.

Yep.

Right here. Bodega Bay.

That's where the Brenners live.

Yep. Mitch and the little girl.

Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.

Mmmm.

Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.

The little Brenner girl?

Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.

Impossible.

No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.

For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?

Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.

I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.

I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.

I know exactly what I want, Mother.

Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.

You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?

Shhh. Shhh.

I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.

No, not exactly.

He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.

What?

I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.

Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.

And if you don't?

Would you like me to go for her?

Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.

We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.

Lovebirds.

As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.

All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?

I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?

I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.

A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 

Ahhh, but I know you.

I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.

No, San Francisco. What are you...?

What for?

I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...

Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?

Seven o'clock then.

He was watching a ball game on television.

Oh. That. Rome.

With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...

Yes, but...

Yes.

No.

I wrote the letter.

I don't give a damn what you believe!

I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.

It's an uprising.

Take wing!

I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...

At Annie's house. She's all right.

Don't let's take any chances.

I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.

And he'll talk?

There is very definitely a difference, Miss.

Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?

I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!

Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.

No one ever said you were, Mitch.

With smoke.

You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.

Not if they're starting a war.

Of course.

Then let's go. Now!

Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.

It is a pity.

I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.

He's a great doctor -- a great man --

I've heard of it.

But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.

At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.

Excuse me.

You see, it is completely out of the question.

Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.

This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.

Gray killed her.

I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.

Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.

Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.

When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.

They'll be thinking of that, too.

You've no thought of going there?

You couldn't do that, Doctor.

Why, yes.

I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.

I wanted to see the white horse --

Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.

A doctor?

That's a good boy, Toddy.

Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.

I've ordered nothing from you.

I've drunk enough tonight.

But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.

Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.

No -- a pride to know that I can force you to my will. I'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor, I've had to do much that I did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps at my whistle, that long am I a man -- and if I have not that, I have nothing. Then I am only a cabman and a grave-robber.

Only Brother.

I come from Lisbon.

A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.

But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.

Aye --

Where are they?

We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."

I think we should get some support?

Where the fuck did you come from?

There's no scar. Corvis made it up.

Who are you?

The scar.

You're the guy killed Dutton.

Nobody.

How can you die if you're already dead?

Your father gave them to both of you.

Someone else did it.

I told you, I knew your sister.

And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.

When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...

Yes I do, I really do.

It's what Lauren would do.

Sign of the dead come back to life.

The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.

Doubt is a motherfucker.

You killed my daughter.

She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.

What did I say?

Watch out!

I don't believe you.

What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.

If you mean that you are afraid of us--

We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?

I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.

Yes -- of course.

That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.

No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.

I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!

Yes, I have!

Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!

Where is that?

No. It's for a lot of other things, too.

Gee! How could they make a landing?

Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?

Mr. Brady's a cop.

Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.

Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.

And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?

From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.

I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.

I mean the reasons for my coming here.

I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.

My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.

I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?

Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?

I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.

You still haven't answered my question.

The picture starts at eight-fifty.

I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.

Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.

You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.

But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.

What time is it?

We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.

Yes -- Just exactly.

Who?

You mean he has the power of life and death?

This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.

How long will I live?  That no one can say.

He'll catch on to it in no time now.

You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.

Would you like to sell it?

No -- I'm afraid not.

You don't.

They would have killed this man?

This one could save your life.

It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.

Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?

El Vampiro.

Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.

C'mon, Star.  Climb on.

What?...

Hey, take it easy.

If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.

I can't do that!

Chill out Edgar.

That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin.  Let's stake 'em.

What happens in tow and a half hours?

If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.

It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.

Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.

I thought we were goin' into town.

No.  Just you.

For what.

No.  I'm up.

I'm tired now.

Must be a circuit breaker.

Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!

No, I'm not...

-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!

I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --

I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.

I hear this is the decade for cute.

You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.

Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!

I thought you said they needed discipline?

It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.

Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!

Well, I...

Tonight.  At the boardwalk...

Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...

Because I love you...

Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?

No.  Why?

Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!

Look at your reflection in the mirror!!

I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.

Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...

Maybe.

... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!

Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.

Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.

Hell no.

Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...

That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?

Cut him loose?

The dogs?

That's good enough.

Probably the next meal.

We got morphine, don't we.

What clothes?

We ain't buying that.

Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.

The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.

Nothing we can do about that.

In this weather?

How far's that?

That far?

You reach anybody yet?

What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!

Don't let up, Childs!

I am going after them.

Could anyone have gotten it from you?

Little over two hours.

Move it, Palmer.

Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...

Calm down and get in your position.

Then we go after him.

Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.

Where?

What happened?

But you're only a mud carrier.

This is it?

How did you know?!

Morlocks --

Yes.

Yes... Thank you.

The air... the power.

What do you mean?

No...

End...?

As slaves.

They survived above.  Became what they are.

No...

Oh, you won't be running for long...

There's a cantilevered gasket on the --

Why is it -- breaking up?

What?

Sorry... I was distracted.

What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.

A moonstone.

Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?

Alex, it's just the zoo.

I have something for you...

I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.

What?

How romantic...

I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?

It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.

For God's Sake, David --

I live with it every minute of every day.

Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...

That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.

Thank you.

Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.

You're not from beyond the valley.

More than 800,000 years.

Why not?

Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...

Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.

Thank you...

You can see so many here.

Good night.

And you saw a shape ahead of you...

Yes.

What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.

What's it all for?

I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?

Learning was important?

You lost someone.

Someone you loved very much.

So you can use it now?

Go back to your own time?

Mara...?

I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.

Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?

Tell him to go away --

Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?

I did...

For our sake, I hope not.

I'm fine.

Then don't.

[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?

I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...

Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of.

Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.

I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?

No, we were patients.

He didn't either.

Oh yeah, what'd he say?

[Beat] What do you need me to do?

What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?

You two ok?

Jackie.

[Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.

I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.

It's December 25th, 1993 today.

What?

You think Lorenson kills you?

Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.

It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.

I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.

I guess I'd ask you why.

No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind.

So it's helping?

Believe me, I know.

You thought my father was crazy?

Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.

Come on. Tell me what you do know.

It doesn't look all that different.

No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.

I did?

What are you talking about?

[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.

The Jacket.

No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.

Why?

You don't have anywhere to stay?

I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.

Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.

You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.

The best I could do with what was in your fridge.

No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.

[Beat] I do it.

No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?

In the leg.

Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.

Louise, I'll do anything.  I know what's makin' you run.  I know what happened to you in Texas.

Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.

My Lord.

Oh, definitely.

The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.

You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common.

Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.

Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.

I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.

Well, you wanna use the shower?

J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.

Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...

Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.

Fishing.  Look, Jimmy... I need you to help me.  This is serious.  I'm in trouble and I need you to help me.  Can you do that?

Not yet.

Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?

In the back?

You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.

What kind of stuff do I bring?

We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.

Isn't this fun?

Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!

I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.

Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?

Get the car!

West.  Left.

Yes.

Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...

What did Darryl say?

I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.

She thinks he's a pig.

He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.

Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.

You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.

Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.

You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.

Taking a shower.

Don't worry about it.  You want anything?

Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!

Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?

They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.

They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!

Why not?!

What.

Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!

Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?

Harlan.

Sorry!

Hit it.

Just asking.

That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.

What do you mean?

We can change our names.

You're drivin'.

And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...

Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.

Why?

Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.

All this for us?

Say you're sorry.

What?

That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.

Woogie, I caught you red-handed.

Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...

He implied it.

Yeah, but he was successful.

Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?

They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.

What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?

I am?

Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary!

Hm?

No.

Jesus Christ you're right.

It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.

Out getting coffee.

Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'

Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.

Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.

What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.

Am I?

Yep.

Dumbshit.

Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.

Thanks.

I already know it, Mary.

Some buildings I'm working on.

Great.

We will, but first I have a surprise.

Deco.

Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?

Have you seen it?

A fucking moron.

Wow. I thought I was the only one.

What?

Huh... that's strange.

Forget it. It was... fun.

Warren!

She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.

Well, I know you're busy...

No.

You can't be serious.

I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.

So you found Mary?

Huh?

She's in a wheelchair?!

Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?

Rollerpig? Are you nuts?

Surprised?

And you met Mary how?

I never said that.

No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.

Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.

The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.

That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?

Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.

Oh, yeah, of course, dear.

Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.

Healy.

No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.

Huh?

Oh yeah.

Just a minute.

Who's that?

Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.

Oh great, I ran out.

Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.

Yeah?

Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?

Trying to be.

All right, let's go.

Toy poodle!

Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --

Really?

Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.

You got what stuck?

No, that's really unneces --

No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.

Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.

What are you doing?

Yes.

Tomorrow...

So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.

We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.

What if I can't?

Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.

We've got bigger problems right now.

McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.

That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?

Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.

Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.

Something your father would've come up with.

He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.

Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.

Cuba.

And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.

48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.

McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.

We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.

The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.

Forget it, Scotty.

Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.

What about you? Where are you going?

There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.

Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.

No way.

You're scared to cancel on Daly.

I don't know. I don't know.

Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.

Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.

You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.

And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.

Rug samples.

Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.

They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.

FBI? What you investigatin'?

Sioux Indian, right?

It ain't Geronimo.

-- did you understand me when I said that --

Jesus...

Good.

Go ahead.

Cooch. You're my hero.

Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.

Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.

-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --

I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.

Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.

Thanks, Cooch.

You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --

You're steppin' on sign.

You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?

You've got no jurisdiction.

His spiritual mother...

Medicine. As in medicine man?

He knows me?

Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.

Why should I tell you.

-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.

Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.

Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.

Ray --

What are you talking about?

And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.

No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.

What do you mean?

What?

So they took care of Leo.

Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.

He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.

If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.

That's right. Turn around.

When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?

NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.

Good.

Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?

I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!

I could be, too.

Yeow!

I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.

It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.

Two miles.

You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.

Um. You.

You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.

Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?

A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.



It's not suffering anymore.

They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.

Maybe I shouldn't take it.

Do what, show you a good time?

True.

That's three.

Who's gonna win?

Well what?

Yes sir.

F-14's sir.

EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED.  ROLL IT, COUGAR.

NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.

It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!

These guys are getting on my nerves.

You're crazy. We're level.

It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.

You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.

DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.

Not anymore.

I GOT ONE COMING UP.

Okay.

What do I want?

Like what?

Got you here.

Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?

Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?

Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.

Come on, relax...

No shit! That why they call him Ice?

They should have warned you about that one.

What'd you do?

Was.

SHIT!!

GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.

I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?

Just below ten thousand.

Bad?

Yes sir.

Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.

ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

Oh, you mean the thrill!

All right.

My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.

My wife's house.

Or....

I don't know...

It's not true.

Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.

The Last Resort.

But maybe you can change all that.

They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.

Who are you?

So why am I still alive?

I am Quaid.

I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.

Yes, sir.

Don't be an idiot.

I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.

Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now.

Hetero.

I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.

At Rekall.

How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?

Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.

Any news of Quaid?

Where?

Arrest that woman!

You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?

Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.

Rekall?

Oh, Rekall.

Well don't.

A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.

Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.

You went to Rekall, remember?

Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.

You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!

Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!

I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.

I've got Quaid.

Up!

Drive!  DRIVE!!

Yeah, sweetheart?

Oh God, Doug.

I didn't know you were so kinky.

Bullshit.

Mars.

You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".

Aaah, let me tantalize you.  You're a top operative, back under deep cover on your most important mission.  People are trying to kill you left and right. You meet a beautiful, exotic woman...

I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?

There's something I have to tell you...

He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.

Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!

Jump!

I used to model for 'em, why?

I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.

I saw them.

Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.

Enough for everybody to breathe?

What?

Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?

That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.

Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.

You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...

In a minute.

No.  We go straight.

Nope, there!  That's one.

Howdy, Rhonda.

Has a lot of rain.

Do not talk to the driver.

What the hell do we know about seismographs?

Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.

If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?

You got that right.

Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?

Oh shit!

Me, too.

Right.

Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.

Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.

Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.

Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!

Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...

You are so full of shit...

Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.

You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.

Yeah, vibrations in the ground.

It does.

They're working together, too.

Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?

LET'S DO IT!

An hour after you picked it up!

No it is not, Mr. Dowd.

-- With objection!

Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.

I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...

No further questions.

No. No...

Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.

That's why I hate experts.

I've got a meeting in Chinatown.

You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?

Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right!

Least we'd already be at the Morgue.

... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.

-- Me? Neither.

"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?

"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?

Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...

I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.

Nothing has. But that's all changing.

EXACTLY!

Exactly what happened then?

"Painted"?

I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.

See-cil.

What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.

That's right.

-- alleged crime --

I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.

I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?

I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.

Shouldn't one of us...?

That's right.

I would tend to plead the Fifth.

Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?

For control of the prison drug trade?

Yeah, we do some of that.

A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...

That's right.

Soldado.

Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?

Telephone.  I suppose you don't know the phone company killed Kennedy because he was trying to b-break it up -- and they'll never let that happen. They control everything: what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end, and --

And you b-believe that.

The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.

Albert.

A woman.

She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.

I want you to kill for me.

I want you to kill for me.

I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.

You're lucky I am not wasting you.

We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.

Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?

I am not going to Cliff's trailer.

Did she have someone with her?

That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.

OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.

Thanks.

Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.

It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.

Faulty wiring.

Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.

He probably wanted to drive over.

You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.

I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.

Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.

You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.

Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.

YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!

Cause I like it.

No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.

Brother, I hear you talkin'.

Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.

I am The Muffin.

James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.

How can I be together if I'm not together?

Not now.

I just can't, James. I can't do it.

I do love you.  Let's get lost together.

Boating?

They were looking for wood.

That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.

Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?

I'm sorry, Mom.

Mom... what are you wearing?

Mom, take it easy.

Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.

A friend from school.

We're late to get to your mother.

No.

They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.

Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.

Yes.

Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.

All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.

Yes. It would be.

And no one will know the truth.

Mickey told me to come back to work.

...yes. Get her on the phone...

It looks that way.

Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...

Yes.

I...

No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...

I'm just an M.D.

Meth... Methodology and Technique...

'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.

I am seventy-four years old.

...to get her heartbeat back...?

I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.

I was her doctor.

When she...

What did these people do when her heart stopped?

That's right.

Well, we...

...We did everything we could...

My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...

It was good of you to meet...

There's nothing they can do to me.

Yes... I... yes.

'Code Blue'...

Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.

Right. Who called?

To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?

You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?

Yes.

I did.

Why is that?

...things change.

You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.

That happens.

I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.

And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.

Still looking.

I changed my room at the Hotel.

And what are you? A cop?

My ex-husband was a lawyer.

Yes. It was, actually.

I've got to work.

I... do you want me to leave?

I...

Is there going to be a later...?

You, you don't under...

It's over!

Stop pressuring me...

I have to talk to you.

Mr. Alito, please.

I've got nothing to say to you.

Nothing happened.

You know, you're pushy, fella...

It's locked.

...I understand...

...and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent...

I'm going to see you get that chance.

We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to...

Yes.

He's... you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.  He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...

Yeah.

What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?

...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...

What do you want?

...I'm going to need your help...

Admittance form is wrong.

Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.

Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?

Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.

D'you find the obstetric nurse?

You use their witness.

...one of the other nurses?

Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...

We got to talk.

I don't want a mistrial.

I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...

Yes, the roving nurse...

How'm I doing so far?

Me, too.

Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.

Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?

Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!

Automobile ignitions are insulated.

I bought it for the square dance. I thought I ought to wear some- thing Western.

It's gone now.

Don't you live at home?

But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.

Hours.  I've been so scared...!

It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down.

I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.

It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.

I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.

It was nearer than that.

Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?

Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.

He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.

Come on.  Kids love horror.

What?

I don't follow.

You get any sleep last night?

I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?

Chase, it's Dylan!

You have a fever, sweetie?

I like this story.

They were safe and could sleep.

Not sleepy.

You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...

Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.

Right 'cross the freeway.

Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.

When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.

That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.

Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.

No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.

Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...

What's that?

Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.

Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.

Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.

Coffee'd be nice.

It's time these boys saw some real blue water.

Yep.

Give me some time to blow the man down...

Yes, Sir.

Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.

I didn't know sir.

Fifteen.

Yes sir.

Yeah, sure.

Gieg, Chuck.

That's what they get for not locking the door.

My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.

If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.

Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.

That's not why he's sending me.

Nobody says you have to be like me.

Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.

We all have problems.

No, I didn't.

Yes.

Fine.

How do you know?  They might.

Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?

Speak up boy!

You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.

So is violating international law.

I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.

Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.

This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.

And, of course, we are.

Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?

No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?

You do?

We're short one long boat too.  Come on.

Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.

Come on, he didn't mean anything.

Trust me donut.  I know.

You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?

You know what he is talking about here?

Outer.

No.  Bring him on deck with the others.

About anything.

Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!

Sir.

He climbed when he was ready.

Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.

... Absolutely not.

I am accountable.

No.  I didn't.

I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.

I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!

I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.

So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?

Well... Yeah - okay.

Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.

Sorry to hear it.

She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?

Told ya I would. You still riled?

No, of course.

What's the name of it?

No sir...

We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.

Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.

I couldn't say, which one?

Why not? How was the fishin'?

Hasta siempre.

He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.

Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?

Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?

You ain't actin', mama.

And?

Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.

'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."

Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.

Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.

I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?

She got me an abortion...

There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.

We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.

Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...

You up for that?

What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.

You got about six more big states to go before we find out.

Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.

Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?

Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?

I'm goin'.

Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?

Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.

Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?

Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.

Few beers is all. Feelin' any better?

Uh-huh?

Lula, I got to get some sleep.

You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.

Really, Lula, this ain't right!

Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?

No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.

Got any plans?

Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.

What if I told you not to?

I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?

I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.

I want you to get rid of Sailor.

Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?

All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.

Santos...

See! I knew you had it all under control.

There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...

You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.

Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.

Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.

Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?

Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.

Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.

We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.

We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.

So I hear.

You're welcome.

Perfect. Well then, shall we?

Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?

This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.

No. Not yet he isn't.

Back up. Go out the other way.

Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.

Competence.

I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.

I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.

So what's the problem?

The Chancellor's here? Now?

Find the jacket.

I have an alternate version of the first chapter.

Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?

Gee, I don't know, Crabs...  Improvise. You're good at that.

Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.

Excuse me?

Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.

You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!

With Emily?

Are you there to not reconcile with her?

Yea?

It's very convincing.

No! What gave you that idea?

You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?

It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.

I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.

I'll miss my bus.

That's really it.

I put you on the floor.

I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?

No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.

I guess there's probably a story behind that.

I don't know...  Me.

Your father worked in a mannequin factory?

What kind of dancer?

I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.

I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?

You're mad at me, aren't you?

Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.

James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.

Jealous? Of me?

Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?

No thanks.

I don't know... 'Episodes.'

Okay.

James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?

Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.

James'll know about George Sanders.

Oh. Well. I...

At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --

I told you, Sewickly Heights.

Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.

That good, huh?

Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --

Yes.

I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.

Don't. I know what you're going to say.

Caps.

A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.

Really, Sara, I...

Inside.

I said it didn't sound like you.

Some times...

In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.

That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.

Jesus. Is that what he told you?

It's Grady, Walter.

This is important.

Sara. I'm in love with her.

Only when I'm working.

I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.

I -- just want to say I'm sorry.

The perpetrator.

I might have his number on campus.

No, I'm going ho --

K through sixth.

It wasn't like that.

She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.

Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.

Sure.

Ask me. Ask me anything.

That was terrific.

Not yet.

Cop.

Why don't you just tell me?

I could get a search warrant.

What?

Yes.

No.

Woodsman?

Know what?

No.

You're a cop. Figure it out.

Yes.

It gives me headaches.

Yeah.

Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.

Can I ask how old you are?

Are you sure?

Do you like it when he asks you?

Robin, listen to me.

Can't I stay a little longer?

I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.

That was a joke.

I'm still thinking about it.

I don't need someone else.

I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.

I'm not that crazy.

If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?

We have a few more minutes.

I couldn't say.

I don't.

Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!

What did you want to happen?

Is this the first one?

I want you to calm down.

Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?

Sorry.

I said I was sorry.

You mean my problem?

I don't know.

What?

Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.

Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen?

This is garbage!

Accept you?

Are you okay?

Me?

No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.

Neither do you.

I'll buy a plant.

You must hate it.

What about them?

Yeah, they could.

What?

What for?

When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.

How many girls did you molest?

I told you I'm not easily shocked.

Hey, I'm not --

No. Never again.

What?

I know.

You must hate your brothers.

You never asked them about it?

I'm not scared.

Live together.

I think it's a fucking good idea.

Guess that makes you pretty special.

I'm not scared.

Do what?

Nothing.

Where're you?

We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.

Hey, you okay?

Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.

I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.

Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.

No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.

I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.

Yeah?  Well I'm not.

I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.

Lindsey!  Wait a second--

It's trying to communicate.

Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.

Yeah.  So sue me.

Calm down, Bud.

NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--

It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.

I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.

Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.

Why bring it here?

Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?

That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.

I can't... make it... podner.

Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...

Give me that!!

We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?

Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I like that better then UFOs.  Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects.

That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!

Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.

I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...

Through three miles of water?   I don't know.

I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...

What a question... Because I want to be with you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... Isn't this water wonderful!

So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.

But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?

It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.

And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?

Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.

All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.

That's Patrizia's way of letting us know she's with us.

Then why don't we go up and see the ruins?

Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.

Occasionally, but always with affection.

No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...

Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication...

But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...

So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.

So, you wonder why?

Why?

I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.

Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...

Good night. Tell me that you love me.

I deserve it.

I would say he's pretty depraved.

But then why did you bother changing?

You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.

But why all nudes?

It couldn't be any clearer.

I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.

You must know your third grade geography book inside out.

Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.

But why?... What if it starts to rain?

Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.

When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.

So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?

And where do you find the models?

Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.

Because this is a Chinese radio.

What boat?

I don't see why I should mind.

Good. Then I'll meet you there.

Yes, we will.

Ettore must be fed up with me by now.

If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...

Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?

Is that far from here?

Why?

Agnes...

Why?

That's not what he meant.

Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.

You've got to eat something Agnes.

Yes, of God.

In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.

It made them holy.

I don't know... I don't know...

Yes.

That wasn't me.

Yes.

Yes.

Oh, yes!

Oh, I know he does.

Yes.

Did it hurt?

And what did you do?

Agnes, how are babies born?

Then let's talk about something else...

Agnes...

Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.

I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.

Somebody told her.

I don't know.

You'll laugh.

No.

No, but I can never tell her that.

Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.

Everything... I don't have children.

I'm always bad.

... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.

And then...

I'm afraid.

Alright.

Yes.

Yes.

To help me.

Because I was afraid.

We went to chapel for vespers.

I don't know which one 

They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...

How did she know about him?

Where?

So she sent you?

Of course you do. Who was it?

Yes.

I put her to sleep.

Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.

No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.

Thanks...

What?  You think that the girl is innocent?

It's gone on long enough. You're out.

When?

I can get you new evidence next week.

Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.

You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.

Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?

Uh huh.

Yes... I...

... Thank you.

She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.

We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.

Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.

Look, someone gave her the baby.

Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.

I am not with the Inquisition.

What's your opinion?

And in your eyes?

About two years before.

It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...

I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.

What?

Oh, some time in January.

Yes.

What is it?

I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.

I don't think I care to know.

Don't deny it!

Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...

You just said...

And what has that to do with it?

Long, thin and filtered.

Oh, you've come a long way baby.

Become?  One is born a saint.

Listen to her singing.

Begin what?

You're what?

One that will ask the questions you want asked.

Well give me a reasonable explanation

You're saying God did it?

I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.

Then she's a liar.

What happened to the baby?

Eh?

They are?

Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?

Read 'em!

Yeah.

Oh, my God, he's a natural.

Of course I can.

Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?

I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.

Ah well. Eh, look!

You crawler.

Is he?

Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.

Come here.

It's Paul's grandfather.

Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.

Eh, there's only three of them.

Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.

I've got you worried, haven't I?

Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?

No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.

Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?

Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?

And you honestly think that's what she meant?

Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.

Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!

Yeah ... what's in it for me?

Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?

Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.

Oh, they seem all right to me.

Lip reading.

What's he on about?

Hello.

But I'm clean.

Don't dramatise.

You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?

Why do you always use your left hand?

For Ringo.

Hiding.

No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.

Foreign devil ...

Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.

That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?

It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.

Hi, our lot!

What?

No, not me.

Is it? Is it really?

Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?

Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.

Aren't we ...

Good lad, Ringo.

I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.

Someone put it on me.

But...

Oh, down the ... er ...?

And they want me?

You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.

I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.

Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.

... I don't know...

Point eight six.  We can walk on it.

Activated.  Vertical drop checked. Correcting course.  On tangential course now, orbiting.  Crossing the terminator.  Entering night side.

What's the terrain down there?

Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?

You want to try?

Take care.

Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.

Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.

I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!

I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.

Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.

It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.

It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... "  And that's all it could translate.

That way.

It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.

Damn it!  How long to fix?

Well we better do something.

Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.

You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...

I'll come with you.

Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets.  Let's get down to the locker and change.

Don't be an idiot.

At least it can't get up here now.

It's time for drastic remedies.

Good!  That's good!

The flamethrower needs more fuel.

Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 

I've completely lost their signal.

The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.

We're not going anywhere.

I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.

The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.

We can use the flamethrower.

I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.

Dell -- show me that on a screen.

Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.

You lead.

How far?

<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!

Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off.

Let's let the machine work on him.

The commander normally has first publication rights.

Room by room, corridor by corridor.

We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.

Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?

Right.  Fire up all systems.

Engine room, what happened?

Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?

Good!  Moisture content?

Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...

Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.

We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.

Good.

Is that its mouth?

Up one kilometer, Jay.

We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!

It started crashing around right after we locked it in.

Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.

The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.

What's that supposed to mean?

Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.

That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.

Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.

And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...

What did it do to you?

I'll get you out of there.

But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!

It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.

Yeah...

God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.

We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.

Shit.  When?

No, but I got something that might interest you.

We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.

The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.

Do it.

Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.

That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.

I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.

What's wrong?

Where does that lead to?

How tight are these shafts?

Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.

Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.

What?  Why?

I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.

How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?

Real man' drink.

'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?

Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?

I... I can't!

Phoebe.

I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?

That's right.

Yes. The Shubert.

I believe I will.

Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.

I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.

It wasn't meant to be.

Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!

Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.

A dull cliche.

No-no-no...

Yes, Addison.

Yes, Addison.

You can have one at Max's.

Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.

It's the same thing, isn't it?

You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.

That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.

We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities...

You were there? At the play - last night?

It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.

Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?

How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.

Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.

Everything... everything's so funny...

Thank you so much.

Like a nylon lemon peel-

All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...

Sing it?

I get a party, don't I?

It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...

I love you...

You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?

She's a girl of so many rare qualities.

It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.

You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.

Eve?  How enchanting...  Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell?

I'm trying terribly hard.

You've been all through that with Lloyd-

Margo, let's make peace.

Then what would be enough?  If we were married?

Hear, hear...

You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.

Is it the money?

You didn't have to tell me.

Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.

It means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... And I'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be - just someone. To give so much for almost always so little...

You shouldn't have had any doubts.

Is that what you want me to be?

I'm for it.

I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...

Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.

Buy some.

Oh, brother.

You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...

No.

Night an' day.

My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?

That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?

Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...

Miss Harrington...

Subway.

I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...

Oh, no...

Eve. Eve Harrington.

Try...

I'd like that.

Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.

Karen.

Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?

I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...

Do you think Miss Channing would approve?

I won't forget.

I don't intend to be.

Over my dead body...

Thank you, Karen.

'Remembrance'.

The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...

Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...

I wouldn't like.

I had no idea you knew each other.

Hello, Miss Channing.

It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-

Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...

You're Margo. Just - Margo.

Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.

Well...

I just can't believe it.

I can't believe Eve said those things!

It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.

In a minute...

Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-

When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-

Five-fifty-five. We'll be at the station in plenty of time...

Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.

Eve?

I wonder why.

That's quite a change of subject.

Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?

Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.

Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!

What is he talking about?

Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.

I will.

Twentyish. It isn't important.

Margo, you haven't got any age.

Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...

Just one person. Isn't that so?  You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.

Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...

It seems almost inconceivable that I haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. So Eve is not working for Max after all-  - Max you sly puss.

She was a revelation...

- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!

Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!

Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?

Well. I don't want to play "Cora."

We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...

Go ahead, please...

Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...

Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.

I feel right now like there's one burning in me.

Would you?

This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.

I promise.

Answer my question!

--it was bullshit the way it was--

--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--

--read 'em both and you'll see--

It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.

Let me lay a little theory on you--

--a spy, you mean?

The fucking New York Times.

For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.

Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.

Go on, go on--

Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.

--we will--

--Colson.

--shit, who do we know?--

--Haldeman I know, who else?

--'cause I only know four chords--

Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.

--he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--

--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--

--almost a year before he left the Justice Department--

11:30.

Any idea what he did?

And you will.  But not now.

Well of course.

I've got a lot of energy.

Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.

I didn't.

When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?

On the orders of Haldeman?

--that was awhile ago--

You're the fella who forgot he rented a Hertz car, do I have to tell you they didn't forget to send us the bill?

--yes--

If they ever start calling us goddamn liars--  --it's time to start circling the wagons.

I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts.  Put him on.  Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid?  Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled.  A wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken.  Ken, I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to.

Absolutely--

Where are your bills, Carl?

You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?

This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.

I never worked for Sloan or Stans.

My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?

A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 

To cover up?

My non-denial denial.

Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?

I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.

There is no reason to assume other people were involved.

You're a lawyer and you're here--

Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--

...you're definitely doing a story...?

I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?

I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.

Who?--be specific. How high up?

Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?

The C.I.A.

--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?

You can't believe that.

Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--

My wife told me to expect you.  As you know, I haven't talked to the press.

You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--

As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.

Haldeman.  Right?

Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.

--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.

The what to what?

Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.

Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?

I believe the kegs are upstairs.

Single malt?

Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?

Neither did I!

Yep.

Uh-huh.

Seduce her.

Charming.

Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?

Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."

I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.

How did you know I was here?

Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.

Sure.

...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.

I'm not playing.

What's that?

No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --

Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?

Sure.

Well...I'm pretty sure I've --

Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.

No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!

Did you guys hook up or something?

Finch, you got the Latin homework?

You can crash at Stifler's?

So, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?

No, a <u>pact</u>.  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.

No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.

No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!

Come on, Jim.  Where are you?

Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.

You fuckin' rule!

It's not what it looks like!

Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?

Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.

Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.

Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.

Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.

Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...

It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.

I told you.

What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!

Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.

A <u>hot</u> cartoon.

So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?

No.  Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net.  I don't think they liked it.

Okay.

Me?

Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.

No, no, I'm not done!  I've got reserves!  Nadia, please please please.  I'm begging you.

Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.

God dammit, Stifler!

Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?

Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?

How?

Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.

Yeah, we have something great, Vick.

Wow, Kev...it's perfect.

Okay.

I love you.

Yeah, the time went by so fast.

Once, in church, dude.

This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.

I think we're falling in love.

Fuck yeah we will.

Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.

Yep.

I'd use pills. They're painless.

Uhh! Would you die already!

You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.

But you better hurry.

Yeah, that's the word. And you are?

You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.

It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?

Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.

Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.

It's okay. I can see fine.

Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!

Are you okay?

I know. He told me.

I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.

I didn't know he had a wine cellar.

I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...

Yeah. French fries...

Fuck me...

I couldn't do it. Not to you.

Where?

"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."

After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.

Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.

Andy...

It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!

Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -

Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...

My uncle's in a coma you moron!

Or else what? You'll kill me?

You'll never get the chance.

And you call me a moron...

Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.

If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?

Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!

What?!

But... I don't remember anything, I swear...

I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.

What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 

I told him it wasn't ready...

I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?

Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?

How well did, er, do you know him?

Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?

I told you. These murders are not normal.

Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?

God, well don't let him go! Catch him!

You fucking liar!

Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.

But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.

Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?

How to read.

No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.

Then come find me.

She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to

Yes, your highness.

Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!

Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .

I have my reasons.

It's not you - it's the dress!

Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?

I'm glad you	did too.

Anya... where are we?

No, he just wanted to know you were happy.

Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.

You'd lose your security deposit?

We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.

That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!

Yes. And I hate that in a woman.

What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!

And tell me that she's happy.

Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.

You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?

This guy's on television.

You don't want my autograph.

M'mm.

Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.

It's okay.

Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.

Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.

L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.

I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!

Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.

I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.

How can you possibly oversleep?

Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.

That movie makes me feel guilty.

M'm.

Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.

Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.

Oooh! Here! Here!

I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.

Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.

I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?

I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.

Well, where is it? I-

I'll getcha a piece.

Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.

Don't be funny.

Yeah, I know.

Oh, yeah, yeah.

You sure?

Okay.

Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.

Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...

No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.

'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.

Fifteen years, yeah.

Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.

Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.

It's terrific.

Really?

Okay. Yeah.

Yeah.

Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.

No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and

M'hm.

U-huh.

Oh, yeah.

You are extremely sexy.

Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.

Do I love you?

I have a tiny apartment.

'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.

Well, have you ever made love high?

I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.

Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-

Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.

Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.

We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.

Will it change your wife?

Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!

A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!

And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?

Yeah.

It was just great!

It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.

Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.

Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.

Yeah, but no presents till midnight.

But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.

How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.

Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.

It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.

I'm cool.

Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies.  And I think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark.

Thanks, honey.

Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?

I'm late.

Step up here!

Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.

Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.

"Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."

I can't.

My head is throbbing.

Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.

He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.

He's screaming his opinions in my ear.

It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...

I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!

This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.

Trigger.

Yeah, I love it there.

I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.

You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is that what you said? Oh, I-I don't understand. Are you joking, or what?

We can show her the schoolyard.

While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party.

Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.

No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...

Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.

Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.

Yeah. Right.

She was stealing.

SO?

Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.

Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?

I really enjoyed it.  Nice to have metcha. Good night.

I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.

Yeah.

A triumph.  When did you get here?

You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.

One guess.

I'm not that good.

Why last?

She's got great tits.

Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.

The camera loves her.  A great actress.

What?

I'm in mourning.

Not this time.

I...wait, what are you talking about?

What?

You need to knock off the pills, Clair.

My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life.

With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.

I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.

Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two.  Can you help me with this stuff?

Fuck you.

I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.

Let's go upstairs, okay?

Lucy overdosed.

Leave us alone right now.

We live next door.

I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.

There's still time to undo this.

Before I forget.  Put it on the bookshelf.

Ryan's novel.

Hardly...

Through the sweats or not?

We're great.

You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.

No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.

It's taken care of.

It's alright.  Be our guests.

Well he can't have gone far.

Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.

Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...

Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.

Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.

Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.

This is insanity.  Sally...

Don't do this.

What?!  You aborted our child?!

You're not ready.

You don't have to.

Oh, you know, I am.

Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?

I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?

You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.

But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.

What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.

Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?

Oh.  You're serious.

No, he's absolutely right.  You're absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be banned.  Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  Can I get you a drink?

Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?

Uh-huh.

Oh.

I will treasure this.

That's a lot of those.

This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.

Trust him.

You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.

I'm not going to leave you alone.

Excuse me?

Sally?

Yes.

No, never.

Oh great.

You see, that's worse.

It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.

"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."

I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.

What does that mean?

Thanks.

You don't need to thank me.

It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.

Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself.

Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?

Evie has a little something for you.

And here they are!

The both of you.

You weren't exactly horrified.

Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --

Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!

Well...  I declared war!

It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.

You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?

I work in the palace, I don't get out much.

Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.

You -- you think I'm right?

Divinely?

Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.

Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!

No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!

Well I guess that makes us even.

Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.

I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.

Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?

Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".

Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.

I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.

There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.

And do Princesses do improper things?

Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.

It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?

Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...

Outstanding.  Princess...?

Uh, actually, we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir...

Thank you, sir.

Oh, of course --

We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...

I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?

Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!

They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier.

But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?

I'll be back.

I don't know what you're talking about, Z.

And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.

Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!

Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...

That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.

Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.

Oh!

It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?

Good night.

I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.

Just tell 'em -- now and then.

I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --

Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?

How come?

Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.

I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.

Of course not.

I think so.

I don't understand --

Let me help you.

My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.

Baxter.

No -- it's my stomach.

That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --

I'm not very good at it.

A cemetery?

Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?

Sure.

I don't want to talk to him.

Sure.  What's that funny smell?

Oh.

As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.

It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --

Cheers.

I don't?

I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.  Come on, Oscar.

Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.

In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.

Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --

West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --

Well, usually I slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again -- I can promise you that --

Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.

Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.

Relax, Baxter.

Yes, of course.

You too, sir.

Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?

Yes, sir.

Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --

The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --

I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.

How's that again?

No I didn't.

That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.

Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.

You?

I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.

Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.

Maybe you're using the wrong approach.

Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --

Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?

You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.

Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --

Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.

Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 

Just as long as she's okay.

Sure.

Kubelik -- with two k's.

Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.  But as your neighbor, I'd like to kick your keester clear around the block.  Mind if I cool this off?

Oh, I'm fine, Doc.

Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.

I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.

Happy New Year.

You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.

Not particularly.

Good night.

It's an emergency -- see you some other time.

Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?

A.W.O.L.?

That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.

You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.

This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.

I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.

Handle what?

And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --

All set for what?

Baxter?

Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.

What gives?

Lovely. You were a big help.

Yeah --

I like all of them --

That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --

Esprit de corps --

We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --

Yeah. Way north.

At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?

What did you put in all those ammo boxes?

I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens.

No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --

No shit.

... he's an amazing officer.

You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --

Thta's not Charlie's work --

If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.

Looks pretty shallow.

One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.

You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.

Terminate with extreme prejudice.

Yeah, it still runs.

Charlie?

He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.

Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.

Okay, Willard, sit down.

I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.

We took them from the dead.  Now -- I assume you want to rest, to shower. We'll attend to your repairs after dinner.

A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.

I always thought the French came here to get the rubber.

Your daughter.

Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.

It's still pretty hairy, sir.

Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.

Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.

Haiphong.

I met him.

Hairy ?

Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.

Yes, I know.

We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.

No -- no, sir.

You know you're right.

Yes.

You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.

Yeah, I like it...

I'm gonna get you out of here.

It's a feeling you get in the jungle. When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying.

No -- leave it --

Why?

You're Australian?

Why didn't he shoot you?

I'm sorry to hear that.

No. Not really.

The river is beautiful.

Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --

Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?

Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.

Wait 'til I'm across!

150  CONTINUED:

157  CONTINUED:

There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.

168  CONTINUED:

Keep back.

26   CONTINUED:  

28   CONTINUED:

She's dead.

Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.

The radio's on the fritz.

Why?

I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.

Come here...

Wait a second.

Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.

That's my line.

Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.

I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.

My home is here.  With you.

-- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.

You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?

I don't plan on dying.

We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.

It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.

We've got another two hours of daylight.

Forget it.  It would take days.

Yeah?

You don't get it, do you?

An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.

Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.

Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?

Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.

You're wrong.  Everything we do leaves its mark.  You said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.

Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.

Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?

Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --

-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.

You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.

Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.

I'm right fuckin' here with you.

Huh?

Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?

Come on. Why fight when we know how it will come out. This isn't like stocking or a string of pearls. You don't send this one back.

I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.

Uh-huh.

Yes.

No.

Will you please take it?

You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?

Okay.

His name?

Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.

If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.

What are you doing here?

Yes.

Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.

Thank you.

I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.

Is there another way to see it?

Dancing?

You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?

It was a mistake.

To hell with sex.

I can trust my brain.

You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?

Okay. Good-bye.

... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.

Okay.

You know what? I...

No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.

Why? What have you been thinking about?

Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.

Good night.

Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...

I just love her.  How're you doing?

What are you trying to do to me?

Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?

Won't worry about it. You go ahead.

No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.

Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.

Do it.

Wait here.

I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.

Thank you for walking him.

Stupid dog.  I don't get it.

I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.

Absolutely not.

Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.

Oh God, this is like a nightmare.

But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.

What?

What?  You think I'm running you up?

After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.

I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.

What?

Oh, yeah.

You're too late.

Do you want Rath or not?

The contract was stolen.

Robert?  Robert?

Yeah.

I'm part of the game, just like you.

If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.

Another contractor.

He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.

If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.

Rath.  Robert Rath.

This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other?

We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.

How old were you?

They didn't give you a choice, did they?

Ahhhh...

Why?

Several.

Nothing.

Oh.  What do you think about?

No.

Yes.

He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.

Taiwan.

Transmits and receives.

And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.

You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --

He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.

No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.

I didn't notice them.

And you were drilling these holes...?

Did he explain how this happened?

Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?

I didn't want to complicate the situation.

It can be.

No.

Honestly?

Yes.

The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.

Anytime.

Why not?

It's possible.

Average.

Taken.

Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?

Anything.

Like you?

We're only joking.....It is your round though!

No, just crap. I want some picture frames.

This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.

An alternative literary venue!

Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.

These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.

Care to elaborate?

Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.

I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.

I thought that was part of the charm!

Can you do the lock on it?

But how did the wall get here?

I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.

We don't speak Czech!

Why don't we go together?

Both, see you later.

What?

I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.

I fell in love.

Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.

Holly!

It just happened.

You capitalist pig!

You're kidding.

Did you see anything in the files?

I'm not hungry, really.

We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?

What are you talking about?

Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!

That one?

Doug?

That's my mum's.

They didn't look like medical files to me.

Regards to Her Majesty.

No I'm not, I came to Prague looking for something - this could be it!

Don't worry it's okay!

Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.

I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.

No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.

There's nothing there for me.

But I love you!

Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.

Good, great....Dobchay!

Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.

We don't need you.

Thanks.

Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.

Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.

Uh-huh!

Alright!

It's Josh's.

That's right.

A kind of freedom.

Not all of them!

Yeah!

You don't have fifty foot of apartment!

No problem, is it at your place?

Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!

See you brought one of the patients with you too.

Later.

Go to hell!

Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.

Can we talk in your office?

Heart be still.

I'll tell her you were here.

I'm sorry about how we --

Thanks.

I could take after Dad, too.

I didn't know either.

Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.  Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.

Landon, honey. There's nothing more.

No. Hey. We're sorry, man!

Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --

Me.

No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.

-- This your idea of small talk?

Were?

'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'

-- I know you don't suck at acting.

Kinda. Yeah.

I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...

And you have to meet my father.

Don't bother!

Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.

Looking for something -- someone.

In ten words or less?

My relationship with God is my own.

You don't miss a thing.

Belinda's a very jealous person.

It's not.

No.

What are you talking about?

You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.

Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.

Not possible.

Where?

Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.

I was twelve.

Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --

No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.

I don't want to come here anymore.

It's not that simple.  It costs money to do this at home.

Landon. I can't even do for myself.

He wants help with his lines --

Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?

No.

It was a play.

Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --

Lead man.

That won't be possible.

I don't want to see her hurt.

Ever again.

Like what, sir?

Okay. Sure.  My grandfather. When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand.  Made a big impression on him.

In there.

She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.

Yes. You?

Yes.

That's right.  The world is your oyster.

I'd work backstage or something?

Where did you get -- ?

A similar triangle?

Marty. What's for breakfast?

Fine.

Oh yeah.

Uh, hi....

But he didn't ask me.

You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?

Good.

Not now....

Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?

No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.

All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'

Five cents, please.

What year?

Pro! Release the rope!

The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!

Professor, can this thing send Shemp back in time?

Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...

Blast it -- no, I suppose you're right.... You do know the proper chemical formula?

Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?

Well, it was there.

I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.

Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.

Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.

Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.

1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!

The Orpheum.

What? 

I run this place! 

No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.

What did you do to yours?

Not bad.

They come with the house.

Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.

He never bit me.

I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.

Mmmmm.

I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.

For coming onto my property... With a gun.

Yeah? Why not?

Yeah. I can imagine.

No.

Holly.

Nah, I got me a job.

Now what's he know about garbage, huh?

There you go.

Great.

Yeah, but I don't like it.

Just don't... I've got a headache.

I don't care.

Don't ask me.

What?

He was nervous.

Put that down. It's dirty.

How's he doing?

Yeah.

I don't want a steak.

Excuse me.

Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.

Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.

Yeah.

Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?

You wanna take the chance, Casper?

Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.

Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.

There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-

It?  Who does?

New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.

Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.

Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...

Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.

I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.

Who were you really trying to kill last night?

What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.

Any time.

Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!

I wish he was.  He's real enough.

I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...

Go where?  Where're you going?

You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.

A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?

Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.

Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.

Doesn't look anything like her to me.

Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.

She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.

Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.

Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.

You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his  what about before that?

Before Bill came to Hollywood.

What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?

I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!

Bill 

Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 

What DID you mean?

W.P. Mayhew? The writer?

Well... actually, no Bill...

Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...

Are you all right?

I said drown 'em all! Who is that?

Ever act?

Well not much.

You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-

Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?

I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.

Okay... a quick one, sure...

That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies  though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,

Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...

Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York  hopefully our numbers are growing  who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths  not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...

Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...

...Yeah, okay.

Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.

Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started  I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me  my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.

Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.

No!... I'm fine. Thank you.

Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.

You gotta believe me 

Yeah.

Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.

I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.

That's okay, that's okay, that's okay  that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing  although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?

KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!

Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?

You want my partner to kiss your ass?

His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.

Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?

Give you nose bleeds?

...Fred...

How's about it, Bart?

Excellent picture.

This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it!  Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!

Thanks.

It's not gonna take long, Sam.

It's bullshit.  You know it is.

Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.

My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.

No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.

Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.

Why didn't you tell me?

Who's got access to my goddamn file?

Nilsen.

Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.

She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.

Put your hands up!

I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.

About a year and a half.

Yes.

Only when they make interesting reading.

I quit.

No.

You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?

Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?

What if I call you Nicky?

What do you want from me, Catherine?

I'll meet you there.

I don't have a choice.

Did you like her to watch?

No.

I never have before.

Try me.

When?

Why?

Of course I knew.

It won't sell.

Somebody has to die.

We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.

No thank you.

What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?

No.

What was the weapon?

Routine.

Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.

Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.

I got tired of being played with.

Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.

I know what that's like.

I went over last night, too.

You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.

You don't like punk rockers?

In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.

I don't believe it.

He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.

You're looking for Catherine, not me.

She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there.

What about me?

You don't but it, do you?  She knew nobody would but it.  She knew I'd say she did it.  And she knew nobody would buy it.

Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.

She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.

Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.

Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.

Did you check all four years?

Rene's been telling me about your work.

No, I wanted to make a painting of you.

Oh, I didn't know that.

Ignorant art?

Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.

I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.

My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well.

I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.

You name it, I paint there.

How about right now?

How do you know?

I need a dealer.

Yes, but as a black painter 

You're not?

Yup.

We don't hang them at home, y'know  just in the streets..

Who said that?

See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.

Out?

Still not here.

Use your fucking instinct.

Willie Mays.

The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic  writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..

We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist  she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.

I am... On Gina.  Fuck  I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.

So then what?

He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.

Hi Gina.

I ain't John Henry.

Good. What do you have?

Party girls? Can I call you?

C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.

You mean babies with you?

A present I picked up for you.

What's his name?

Sure. I'd be glad to.

You like your dad's paintings?

Stand still.

Thanks

Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.

No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.

Tony Bennett... What do you mean?

I'll make you another one.

I just don't think you're being fair.

I need this?

I will relay the message.

You'll never guess.

Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.

Yes and no ...

Well, I could ... free up some time...

"We"?  You and...

Photojournalist.

Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.

I'm not scared of you, Max.

One way to find out?

Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.

I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.

Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!

PMS.

Silent night, violent night...

My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--

And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?

Oswald:  We need one more thing.

Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...

Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.

Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -

Oh no, those things frighten me.

You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.

Too late for what, dear child?

Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.

Thanks.

Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?

Everyone dies, Master Bruce.  There's no defeat in that.  Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.

Right here, sir.

What seems to be the problem?

That, sir, does not compute.

Specify, please.

Pheromones?

I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-

Alfred and Bruce are like family.

I'm afraid to ask.

We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.

The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.

He'll be here.

Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.

Just the beast.

Maybe he melted.

Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.

I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.

Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.

I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.

I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.

I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.

I wish I knew.

Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?

You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.

I've got to stop him.

What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?

I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.

Ninety-three, including the sauna.

He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?

Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?

Perhaps the fall...

What?

But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?

Enigma.

I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?

Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?

My life's an open book. You read?

We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.

Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...

No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.

Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.

Wait. You can't go.

Just ones this beautiful.

You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.

And now....

Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?

I don't want to remember!

Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.

Yesssssss. I know!

Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.

Never heard of a double-cross?

Let's see if you bleed green.

Here. Get a good seat.

Don't bogart that 'trode.

About what?

Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!

Upstairs. He's quite docile.

Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.

How do I know you won't keep them all?

Better. It's not on the market yet.

I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.

I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.

Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.

Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.

Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.

Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.

I'll take you home if you'd like.

Maybe we should just kiss.

I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.

... Looks like a convention.

Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --

Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.

... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...

You're one man. You can't save everybody.

I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.

WHAT??

Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.

No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.

Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --

I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.

I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'

What?  I improved her a little...

Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?

Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?

Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.

Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.

Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.

Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.

Oh, Bruce...

Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.

... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?

Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.

Allie, he's not.

You okay?

God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...

And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.

Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.

Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.

Tom Jones?

I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.  Stupid thing.

I need some time, David.  A little time.  It's not just you.  It's partly me.

I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.

Your face smells like a foot.

Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?

Meaning?

Honestly David, you're so spineless.

Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.

Yes.  Ahm... think I'11 ...

Well, Ahm....

Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.

I beg your pardon?

Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.

No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:

Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.

Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?

Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?

... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.

VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...

There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...

Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.

No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.

How the hell should I know?

Okay.....

Why thank you sir.

Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...

Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.

Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh. TV.

Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!

Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.

Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die!

Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.

Heh heh. Yeah.

Me first?

Me first! Me first!

Huh huh. We're gonna score now.

Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!

Cool! Huh huh huh.

Cool, huh huh.

Uh, probably like, another five minutes or something.

Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say that again. Boobs. Heh heh.

C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.

Yeah, maybe some chicks too. Heh heh.

Yeah! We're with the bureau of cigarettes and chicks! We're gonna score!

Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.

That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...

You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.

Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.

Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?

He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...

Ah, the witness?

Cut the power!

That's better. Yes?

D.C., Chief.

Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...

Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.

Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.

Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.

Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.

Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.

Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.

So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.

Don't forget the balls, Ernie.

How's your arm?

That's how long you were gone.

They make gypsies look good.

Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.

You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?

Not really...  what's this?

We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.

We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.

Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.

Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>!  Practice, practice, practice.

She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.

Of course I did.

The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?

I didn't --

All right.

We're ghosts.

Really.  I don't know.

D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.

Can you scare them off?

You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen.

Now, let's get rolling!

We have to start simpler, is that it?

<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.

<u>Out</u>.

Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.

Are you Juno, our case worker?

We need help.  We deserve help.

No.  You don't want his help.

You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?

No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?

'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.

Are you a spirit too?

Yes.

Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!

You've <u>got</u> to say it!

How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.

... I will.

Why not?

Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.

... sheets.

Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?

Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.

I cannot believe this.

Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.

Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?

I say let's keep it the way it is.

I thought I saw something.

Attic space.

Maybe Charles does.

Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.

Yes, but I'm going to live at home.

Hold your breath and we'll pull.

My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!

Their wedding clothes.

But not for long...

Oh, fine.

Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.

There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.

Thank you.

Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.

How do I know when it's ten o'clock?

Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?

In a day or two, yes.

We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!

Stay here? Is that necessary?

Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.

Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?

You really care for him, don't you, Eve?

Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?

Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.

Yes.

Yes. I would like to be on that show.

Oh? Certainly...

My name is Chance.

No. I like it here.

Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.

That's good.

Yes, so do we.

Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.

How is Ben feeling?

No, Eve. I don't read the papers.

Yes, Eve. I know that.

No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.

Thank you.

Yes. I like to watch.

That's very interesting, Eve.

Hello, Eve.

I have nothing more to say.

I see.

I certainly do.

Yes. I like that name very much.

... I see.

Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.

Yes, Ben - he is.

I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.

No, Ben.

Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.

Oh, I see.

A flower...

Yes.

Yes.

No.

Yes.

Yes sir. I'll take care of that.

... Good evening, Louise.

I see.

Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.

Yes, I'm very hungry.

Yes.

Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.

I would like to stay and work in my garden.

Come now, Mr. Chance.

I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...

Yes, I will.

... Nothing.

Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?

Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?

Good evening, Wilson.

Yes, ma'am.

No, that won't do any good.

It's not that, I just...

Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...

Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.

No problem, Chief.

No, sir.

A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!

It's that serious, huh?

I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.

This is my fiancee Maxine.

Okay.

Yeah.

Who am I thinking of?

Please, have a seat.

Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.

Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.

We have to make it an early night.

What?

Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.

Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.

You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.

I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?

You've always loved the animals.

Shut up!

What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.

It'll never happen, fuckface.

Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.

He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?

I'm sorry for everything.

I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.

Holy shit, yes!

Holy shit! He said what I said!

I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.

No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.

Yes?

I am a trained performer.

Glooph is not a letter, sir.

Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.

I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?

The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.

That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.

Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.

How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!

You married?

Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?

Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.

Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.

I'll protect you, Dollface.

J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...

It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.

Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what its for.

Can I be anyone I want?

And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.

Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.

Why are you being like this?

Do you?

You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?

Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.

The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.

Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.

Do we get to wear a crown?

Count me in.

No, I didn't know that.

You bastard!

Let her go, Craig. I mean him."

Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.

One hour.

Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.

Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.

Whatever you're having.

Oh sure. It's very rewarding...

I can explain about the portal, darling.

Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.

No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.

Vegas. Can you arrange that?

I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.

Derek Mantini!

There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..

But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.

Then what do I do?

Well what?

Can't say. It's something can't be planned.

Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.

No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door.

I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.

You remember Halle.

YES.

We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.

Thank you.

May I come in?

Oh.

I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.

I miss her.

In case of what?

Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?

Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.

OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.

I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.

DADDY IS COMING FOR US.

Was over to Baby Suggs.

You sure?

He's sleeping in the church.

Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.

Her who?

What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?

I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.

He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.

Just me.

Who is she? Where she come from?

She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?

Yeah. Look bad?

You got to get up from here, girl.

Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?

She left me. She's gone again.

Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.

Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.

Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.

Huh.

Show me what you got.  Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.

Nothing.

That is for the urn.

Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.

Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.

Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.

I am the Walrus.

Walter, how--

I got eighteen dollars, Dude.

Were you listening to the story, Donny?

Were you listening to the Dude's story?

Shut the fuck up, Donny.

Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.

WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!

Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--

Where's your car, Dude?

Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.

You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--

Yes, uh, very impressive.

Lebowski on the right?

Are these.

--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!

And what do you do, sir?

Far from it.

Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.

Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.

On you, maybe.

But she hasn't run off, she's been--

Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?

Does the Pope shit in the woods?

Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!

Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.

He fixes the cable?

If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.

Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.

I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--

The main guy, Dieter--

Well--yeah, I guess--

Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?

Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.

So Dieter has the money?

It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--

Am I wrong!

Okay. That, uh.

You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?

Hey Walter--

Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!

I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.

It's your roll--

Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--

Easy, Dude.

Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.

What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?

What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--

Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--

But Walter--

They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--

Huh?

Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.

Is the car out front yours?

I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.

Yeah?

What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!

Then what's...

Wha. . . Donny--

Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!

Who is this?

So no funny stuff.  Okay?

Right, Dude.

I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?

Are you employed, sir?

You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.

I don't know, sir.

Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.

Help me put him back in his chair.

We'll take 'em in the morning.

Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".

The House of Pain.

I haven't forgotten.

He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.

Minutes.

If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.

You don't have to hunt to do it.

I don't think so.

Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?

I don't understand.

Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.

I don't like it.

Why don't you ask your girlfriend?

Thought you were dead.

Human?

He was here.  Watching us.

You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.

Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.

Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.

The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.

Look, what's your problem?

Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?

You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.

Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.

And that's a good thing?

It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!

Look closer.

He will.

Like me.

If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.

Blade --

For your miracle cure?

It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.

Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.

You're a week early.

I was afraid that might happen.

There's only one alternative to the serum.

What about the chemistry panel?

This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.

What?

Sometimes --

Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --

Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.

A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.

You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.

My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --

What happens if he doesn't take the serum?

He killed them?

I'll take my chances.

I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.

Because it means the tree is older than the house.

I don't...I don't understand them myself.

--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.

Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.

Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.

Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.

Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.

That's a joke?

She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--

You sure?

Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.

You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.

You don't want it though.

You said the name "James."

Yes.

We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.

Get your goddamn--

--you should get back into bed.

Why?

--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!

<u>Before</u> 5:00--

--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--

Yeah.

I can't let you in.

Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?

It's not about witches, goddamnit!

Hey, Mr. Graduate Fucking Thesis here was s'posed to be driving!

Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.

Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?

So where the hell am I going to sleep?

Yeah?

No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.

What're you doing with all this shit?

Too busy eating us?

I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.

Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!

How's she going to know where to--

--who?

--Graduate Thesis--

Fine.

It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.

--now there.

Spite.

--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!

--oh, Jesus--

Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.

Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.

--no.

Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.

That's why she kills children.

That they'll start touching us inside our heads.

I'm sorry.

--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.

I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.

We're not dealing with fucking logic here!

Don't! You're making me lose my grip.

I thought all witches were benign and good.

Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?

I don't....

Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.

I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--

I just gotta see a guy.

What?

I don't know. It's early... I love you.

I don't know. I better get off now.

...What do you mean?

...What was that?

What do you want to know?

Remy.

About ten years.

Tell him the channels, Dusty.

Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.

See, I never knew that.

Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.

I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--

Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.

Got a job for you.

Of course.

I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...

Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.

Has Ray come in yet?

How would I know?

What.

Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.

Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.

You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?

Okay honey.

Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.

EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.

Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.

It must be great.

It's blue. blue velvet.

Only you. and the photo lab.

Yes sir.

Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?

Oh he forced you, huh?

No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.

Pest control. gotta do your apartment.

Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.

Jeffrey nothing.

I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.

No. Come on.

Nothing. Are you alright?

I'll go then.

You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.

Then don't talk about killing.

O.K.

Frank? .can you stand up?

There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.

No.

. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.

Sure I do.

No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.

Does that scare you?

Kiss me.

I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.

Don?. Where is he?

Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?

Go where?

A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.

What?

Nothing.

Yes.

You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?

Yeah. What are you doing now?

I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.

My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.

I don't know.

Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.

Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.

I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?

Pretty clever. Are you game for more?

You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?

I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.

Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.

It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?

I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.

Look. it can wait till Sunday.

Yeah.

Okay, okay. Bye.

He got a little jealous.

It's okay. Don't worry about it.

Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?

Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.

I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?

You like mysteries that much?

Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.

Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.

Okay. great!

Frank!!

No.

Go ahead.

No Jeffrey!!

Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.

.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.

Do you want the car?

Looks like you'd make a good runner.

I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.

Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.

Yeah, I know.

Okay.

I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.

That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?

You'll see for yourself.

Derek!

What is?

You happy, baby?

Are you kidding?

Yeah, I don't feel so well.

Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?

Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.

Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.

No, I cam here out of my own volition.

What?  Yeah, sure.

Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.

Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.

I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's going to blow an O-ring.

Oh hey, one more thing?

Get me a six pack.

You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?

Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.

I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?

We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.

George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah? Are you out?

Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.

Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The water.  The women.  It's better than Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some friends I would like you to meet.

Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.

Try the back bedroom.

I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?

Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!

You fucked me, Diego.

I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.

Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.

Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.

Mom.

It would be my pleasure.

Un sapo?

Power?

Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.

And Diego?

Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?

That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.

Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.

Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.

Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.

That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?

What do you guys want?

What about him?

No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.

Figured what out?

Figured what out?

Hello.

I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.

Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.

Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.

Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.

That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me.

You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?

Yeah, you will.  Of course.

Yeah.

Better than you.

Are we gonna split up?

You can call me Dad if you want.

You mean, like a trip?

California.

I'll be here.

I don't believe you.

Swear on my life.

Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.

Yes, I am.

Very nice.  I'll take it.

All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.

Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.

G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...

Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.

Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.

The strike is a success; but ...

Dien Bien Phu?

And here?

Sid Ahmed.

Second district ...

It's true.

You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!

I don't even know your name yet ...

No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...

Here?

But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.

I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question.

Rue de Thèbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...

A name?

For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.

It could've happened to anyone.

You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.

Right now.  Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?

What good does that do -- it's the old will?

She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.

For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?

What'd he die of?

We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.

It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.

You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.

Sex.

Then she's not as smart as I thought she was.  You've seen her in the depositions.  Tell me you don't have any doubts?

Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.

I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.

Rebecca Lawson.

I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.

Horrible.  He was tired and pale.

Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.

I had bypass surgery.

It didn't.

It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.

It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control.  She always used to tell me it had to be her way.

We had dinner at a restaurant.

And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.

That's all Dr. Paley.

You called him?

No.

Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.

He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.

There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.

He video taped you.

You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?

She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.

Well - I'm a little confused.  This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account.  It's dated the day of the murder.  Is this your signature?

Then you would have gotten your money?

And she left shortly after that?

You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.

You still haven't answered my question.

Yes.

Sure.  Where to?

Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.

I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.

Hi.  It's Frank.

It won't be that hard.

Yeah.

I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.

You can see me now.

Paley could be a problem tomorrow.

I'm glad you have such confidence in me.

Honey.

Tonight we open new doors.

How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?

She allegedly humped him to death?

Yeah.

Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.

How often do you use cocaine?

Attractive.  Bright.  Distant. Charming when she wants to be.

Yes.

You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.

Daddy -- stop it!

We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.

What time did you leave?

Then we should have had lunch at the bank.

It's not that long.

I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?

Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.

Come here a minute.

That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 

I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.

Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!

"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."

Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?

I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.

Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.

You want me to call the doctor?

That's it.

Hmm-mmm.

No.

How long you been married?

Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?

No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.

I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.

And clean.

Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.

It's still a very sensitive memory for me.

I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.

I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.

They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband.

No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.

You want to go back in?

No.

I told you, I love other people.

That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.

I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.

Yes! Hi.

Wonderful. Uh...

It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.

Why?

Nobody's asking you to.

No.

Yes, thanks.

Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.

You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.

Yeah. It could get better.

I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.

I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.

Later. Go back to sleep.

I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.

Frannie.

I'm going to miss you.

What's she like?

What happened?

I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?

Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.

How the hell should I know?

Take who where?  What you smokin'?

Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you.

Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something about it just buzzes me.

That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.

Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.

Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.

Climb out to where?

Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.

Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.

No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.

They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.

Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.

We met.

Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.

Who?  Who is he?  What is he?

But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.

Aren't you gonna do something about it?

I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.

No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.

Anytime.  Be seeing you.

My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.

What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.

I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father?

Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.

My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.

Bill!  Bill?!

Back here.  At the end of the block.

You got the shit?

Let me see it.

Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.

Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.

I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.

Or you didn't know what to do with it.

What building?

I didn't sell it.

You was just doing your job.

Now you.

No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.

Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.

I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.

The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.

I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.

That building?

I think you're fucking crazy!

All part of the business.

What are you, drunk?

No!  They're still on their way.

Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!

But you know he did it.

Caesar, what are we going to do?

No.

This is insane!

Caesar, what are we going to do?

We're going to need some time.

Don't tell him --

Let us go and we'll make a deal.

Good boy.

They were in a car accident.

Where's the fucking money?

Why?

Hey, Mickey.

Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?

I thought I heard someone knocking.

Me?  Why?

The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.

Where in the hell is he?

Oh yeah.  Violet!

Leave your phone on the hook.

Pretty much.  One day at a time.

I knew it.

I don't, really.  I was referred to him.

I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?

A beer.  Of course.

Why?

...  yes.

They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.

Is that what her daddy tells her?

What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?

Sounds like he wanted to get caught.

Do you think you know me like that?

Johnnie?

It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.

...  shit.

Yeah, twice.

Waiting in the apartment next door.

What happened?

It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.

We're almost there, Violet.  just hang on.

You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.

Don't be sorry.  Help me.

Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.

Violet?

I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.

You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.

I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.

Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.

I'm not asking.

What do you want to do?

We're in the shitter, man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!

...which one are you?...

...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...

...it's a problem...

What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?

Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.

So it's time to go home.

<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...



Who?  Who came?

Did you?



Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.

-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- 

No.

-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.

I don't know.

I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.

I can't believe I slept.

You got me pretty fucking curious.

All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.

-- please -- Jason -- omigod --

-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?

-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --

No.

You're wrong.  I didn't know.

-- there's no time --

You could do that?

xxxxxx

xxxxxx

xxxxxx

xxxxxx

If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.

-- here we go -- I found it --

My husband's out looking for him.

That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?

-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --

-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --

I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.

He's tampered with it, Dowser.

...sabotage!

You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -

... ere please.

... get to it.

What? How do you know my name?

Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...

What? You mean you've got ...

What do I have to do.

It's reply paid.

Layton.

Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?

Well ... well, I ...

Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...

You remember Alison?

I'm sure you have

Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?

Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.

Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.

There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.

Shut up!

Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!

Is it stamped?

Oh.

It's you ... it's you ...

I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?

What?

Looking for you.

Really.

Well, all wars do -

Every day?

Stop it ... damn you!

Oh God! What have we done?

Your face ... are you hurt?

It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.

It's not our mistake!

Information Retrieval.

Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer

What a BITCH!

We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!

I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed

27156789/074328/K.

Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.

Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.

I delivered it.

Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver! All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.  That's what I wanted to know. Thank you very much.

She didn't say anything about it to me.

A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?

No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close -

What is it?

This isn't rare!

Mother!

I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.

Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.

Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.

What? Now? It's my lunch hour.

I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?

What? Who is this?

No need, sir

I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.

Numero, trois.

It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right.

Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?

Are you saying this is illegal?

... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.

The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.

No. But I can bypass it with one of these

My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!

Time to go.

Mary said you might be coming.

I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?

Just take it easy.

No!

I can't hold up my head anymore.

You're going to live.

Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.

Yeah?

Oh man, Bucky.

I guess there's always a chance.

At least he's got people around him.

It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.

Yes.

Yes.

Our Lady of Misery.

It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?

You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.

Maybe I should come up with you.

Fifteen minutes.

No, no.

No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.

The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.

He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.

No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.

Crazy fucker.

Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.

You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.

Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.

What do you want to break?

You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.

That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.

You're burned out.

It's not our job to taxi drunks around.

You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.

Used to be my partner.

You sure?

Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.

Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?

What?

No?

Why?  What did they do to you?

Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?

I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.

Are you any closer to a decision?

Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.

Yes.

I don't like the word gay.

Why do you say that?

Eleven and a half.

I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.

Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.

Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?

As good as humanly possible.

You too.

It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?

No.  You know that I'm not.

Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.

Really?

Well -- my wife got this new job...

Wipe me out?

I understand.  I'll go with you.

Move away from me.

We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready.

Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.

I'll speak to you soon

Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.

Nobody else had it.

Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?

No.  I'm doing fine...Look.

Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.

No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.

I don't know.

It's not.

Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?

No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.

Fill for a second.

That actually goes on...

So great -- right?

I trust you.

No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.

I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.

Billion.

Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.

Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.

Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.

Nooo.  Is it your story?

Why, you need me for the story?

Well...

Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.

How can you say that to me?

I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.

Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.

Right back to you.

I'm going home!

I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.

Shh!

Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.

I already told you I'm not.

Um...

You're breaking my concentration!

What!

I'll pose any way you want.

Of course...it's wonderful.

Murdered man.

Oh...

Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.

Walter!  Jeez!

Yes Walter.

Ready?  We've got plenty of time.

I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!

What are you trying to say?

Why not?!

Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.

I admit it.

Why not?

That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.

I know, man.

I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.

I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...

Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?

I didn't buy it I made it.

Well...

What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.

N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...

Yeah, why?

Yeah and what would I say?

Just wait till you see this!

Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?

Turn around!

Did you like it Mister Brock?

Why not?

If you see him.

Well why don't you clean up this dump!

Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.

I had him in my grasp.

The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?

Litter, yeah!

Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?

Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.

Bummer metaphor.

You think?  Split?

No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.

I mean it.

My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.

Yeah, I guess.

I thought we were meeting here.

Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.

I'm out of here.  Jenny.

Hi there.

I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?

I should have known.

You say that like it's a bad thing.

Where?

Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.

Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --

I'm looking for you, actually.

To bring you... your birthright.

In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.

This is it.

Our purposes.

There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.

Do you know what a Vampire-King is?

Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.

Who we gonna beat?

I had to test you.

No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.

Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?

Try to pay attention.

What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'

Five.

It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.

There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.

Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...

As for example, what?

Vampires of the world, beware.

But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?

My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.

I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.

Cassandra, you gotta come, too.

Thank you very much.

I guess.

Thanks.

Sorry.

Hi.

You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.

I don't understand.

Oh, baby!

Jeffrey!

Okay.

Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.

Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.

I gotta bail.  You coming?

You want some punch?

Like we don't have rights too?

Okay.

Right!

I am.

If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.

Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.

Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.

Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!

it's okay..

Oh--won't YOU come in?

Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...

Don't worry.

Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place

What do you believe in?

Oh my...  Don't leave...

So...Wanta make love?

What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,

That's my job too.

You're pulling your hips out.

Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.

Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?

He won't make love to me anymore.

I want you desperately!

Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.

I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...

It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?

Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.

There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.

I can do that, too.

Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.

She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...

Jesus, what kinda broad are you?

C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!

You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!

Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.

I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.

Gimme that.

You been in the Majors?

I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.

What?

Annie's a smart lady.

It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.

You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.

I'm nervous--my old man's here.

Okay, I'll kick your ass there.

What?

And where can I go?

Crash, shut the door.

I ain't hitting a man first.

See ya at the yard, Meat.

We'll be praying for you.

C'mon big 'un, you're okay...

I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down

Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?

Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.

I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.

They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.

But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.

This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.

Good to see ya.  William would you...

Was I at that dinner?

Yes, you were.

But what happens when they do find out?

It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.

The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!

Watch it, partner, watch it!

Wait, hold on a second.

Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?

You fuckin' piece of shit.

Hello.

You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.

What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?

Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.

Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.

I'm sorry about this. Really.

Nope, there's no way.

In so many words, yes.

Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?

Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.

Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?

I don't wanna come along with you.

I'll be honest with you.

Yeah.

You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.

The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.

Hey, she came to talk...

The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too.

No, a...

Why?

I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.

Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.

No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...

Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.

And what'd she want?

No, I'm not okay.

I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.

I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.

And they were usually right.

Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.

What can I do?

I...

I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.

Hey, Mitch.

I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.

It's nice isn't it?

...they didn't know what really moved her.

Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.

You can trust me.

What?

I don't need one.

No, you don't.

What do you mean?

Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.

I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.

With what?

He needed some clothes.

And where'd you go?

You know why I want to do it. Just do it.

I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.

What if he won't stop?

I can back him off.

...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?

I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-

Listen to me.

Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.

You fuckin' whore!

And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house...

You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!

But it was just mine.

In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...

What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.

These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.

Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.

I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.

Green?

I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?

What?

And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?

You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?

Get out of here.

You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?

I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.

Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.

Well, I've been busy. 

What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?

I understand.

Go get a bag, man.

Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where you goin' -

...fuckin' jerk-off.

Hey!

Nicky, I did -

Nicky, I'm sorry.

Why, does it look like it's bothering me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin' Oscar too. All the fuckin' money I've given that prick, he don't even look over here. What's his problem?

I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?

I understand.

Ma che cazzo!

Mm.

No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.

So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.

He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.

Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.

No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.

Bye.

Mm-hm.

Yes, you are.

Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.

What about my money?

Thank you. Very nice.

Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.

Get lost?

Come on! 

Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?

You are.

You're driving me nuts!

They check in alone?

Are they out now?

I think that's it.

God, I'm telling you, they're out!

You know why, right?

Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.

So are we.

Go fuck yourself.

Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?

Yeah, what'd you tell him?

Oh, he ain't nobody.

Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!

Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.

Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?

Ch-Charlie M!

Hey.

You sure?

Yeah.

Denying?

I'm sorry.

...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.

I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.

Then do it the way you want.

Crowd always buys it. What do we got?

Guilty. I am.

I don't know. I can't remember.

I wonder..

There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..

What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.

I'm sure.

I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."

You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..

I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..

It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...

She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?

Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..

I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.

I know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...

Absolutely.

I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...

Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?

I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to "get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed, but really, what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself, anymore.

You can't get away with..

What's the good news?

"Pre-bicentennial babe?"

Stop.

Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.

Uh. "Thanks?"

What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.

Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..

I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...

I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?

What did--?

Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...

Actually, yes.

Not too cool...

Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story, Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life.

What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?

Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.

Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?

Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.

It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.

What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"

Trust me, you won't have to.

I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.

You going to talk all day?

Taking messages.

I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.

I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie.

I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.

I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.

You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.

Can you make him stop!

I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  That's all. <u>OUT</u>!

So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!

Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.

I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.

Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.

Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.

There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.

I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.

They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.

Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.

He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!

They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.

A woman?

And that was the end of it?

Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.

It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.

The City National on San Vincente.

I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.

Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.

The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.

Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.

Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?

Lucky for them they didn't.

Are you okay?

Yes.

She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.

Include me in that.

Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?

It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?

The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.

The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.

259-7881.

Why are we stopping?

Took preparation.

Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.

Take your hand out of there. Slowly.

Pull over!  Pull over someplace.

Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.

Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.

There are no guarantees in this life.

Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.

I still don't see you.

I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?

She's yours.  What are we waiting on?

Don't worry.

Better reassure him.

Call me "Nels."

The fuck I will!

And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!

I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.

Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.

Mind if I have a look?

How?

See what, Dil?

Did he?

She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.

Saw it, Dil.

Take your fucking goldfish, too!

Not in my experience.

Bloody right I do...

Not me.

You can't leave me then, can you?

Where?

What look?

Jesus.

How different?

Didn't think I could.

I am.

He did sometimes.

Yeah.

I have to talk to her, Col --

Give it over, Dil --

Do you care, Jimmy?

Sorry.

Are you pretending yet?

Please, Jimmy.

I miss you, Jimmy.

Not at all, honey.

You following me?

I'm not sure.

It's a secret.

Yes.

For me.

Don't go like that.

Don't you want to kill me?

Okay.

Let me go, Dil

Got to be somewhere.

I like you, Dil --

Yes.

Never.

Don't call me that --

Stop it, Dil --

You know her, Jimmy?

No, what is the thing?

What do you mean?

You may be right.

Do you want a cup of tea?

And anyway, he's seen our faces.

Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.

Peter.

Would make me feel better about it.

I'm sure.

Should blow you away, you know that?

I understand.

A hotel?

Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.

Good. So what do you think?

Can't we take it off?

Do what?

Not in your nature.

I'm talking about your people, not you.

And you know the funny thing?

No.

What the fuck were you doing here?

My pleasure, Jody

Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?

Shut up, would you?

'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.

Doesn't matter where.

We got simple tastes, you and me.

But you fellas never get a break, do you?

What do you believe in?

No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?

Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?

Want you to do something, Fergus.

But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her.

Stop it --

How can I?

A story.

Tell me something, anything.

Stop that talk now --

What you say, faster?

You don't know me, do you?

Who gives a fuck.

Whatever you say, Jude...

First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!

What about it?

How do you think I got here?

No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.

Adam --

Open up.

I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --

I love you, Adam.

Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.

Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!

I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?

I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --

Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 

Then whose is it? His or theirs?

But I don't have it.

I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.

But --

Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.

Were you followed?

By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.

But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?

I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.

Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.

But no one actually saw him die.

None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.

Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.

Next, please.

Yes.

No.

I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?

Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?

That's the idea.

But you know my name -- it's Dyle.

Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?

Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!

Alexander.

Why couldn't you just look at his feet?

Which one are you?

Reggie -- listen to me --

Tuesday.

First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?

No --

I dare you.

Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.

I don't believe it.

How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.

Fiction or non-fiction?

What do you mean?

Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.

No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face --

I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.

The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.

In money.

You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Félix -- are they for sale now?

That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.

No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.

Tell me what?

But his mother --

I'm very cold.

Swiss.

He didn't have one.

Is that all? Can I go now?

What should we give him?

I know. I would bury it in the garden.

A man traded with me -- all those for only four.

I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives?

Why, do you think we're going to?

You give up awfully easy, don't you?

The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?

Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.

Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?

Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?

I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.

I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.

Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.

You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.

Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.

How do you shave in there?

How would you like a spanking?

Good night.

A quarter of a million dollars.

But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.

Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.

What are you talking about?

Don't put yourself out.

I don't understa--

Wha -- what do you want?

Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --

Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?

Because I don't love him.

Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.

I've never seen him before.

I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.

Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.

What?

Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.

Who invited you?

He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.

That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?

I just wanted to check that you were okay?

The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?

Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?

Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.

I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.

Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.

No I wasn't.

Run!

Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.

She just turned off her light.

I can.

No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?

Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.

You know about that too?

You are 'sp fucking' wrong.

Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .

There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.

I can't right now.

Twenty eight years ago.

Everyone's getting ready for the party.

Yeah. I think it's really sick.

Did Sharon say no?

No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.

Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.

This party is sick.

What?

Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.

Yes?

No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.

The word is Mob.

Who were they?

I'm worried about someone.

So are you.

Told you to hide it.

But you don't really mean it.

INT. ANDY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY/ANDY'S OFFICE - DAY.

INT. TUNNEL - DAY.

Art.

Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.

Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 

...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...

Hang on.  Hang on.



...and a shitload of ice.

For cryin' out loud.

And if that Elvis shit...



You'd better coast through...

Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.

No, you gotta go to McGrud-...

To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.

I did not steal this truck!



...-ed.

Okay.

 No...

Hey, take a look at your situation and...

...-cho and a hijack-...

...you.

You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--



You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 

Goddamn!

Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.

Oh, shit.

Come on.

I know the likeli-...

Come on.

You okay?

 Oh...

 

...man!

Taking it down the hill.

Okay.  Okay.

Oh, no!



You're fucked, man.

...overdrawn bank accounts.

Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.

...-er.  It was your friend...

Yeah, baby!



We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!

Okay. 





...-ful?!

Whoo!

 What's it say? 



 

 

We got-...

 Vitelli! Vitelli!

Can we get out on your end of the tunnel?

 There's gotta be...

Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.

Elvis is still in there!  It's gonna go off!

Who drove the ice cream...

...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?

...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.

Thank you.

I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...

But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.

Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.

Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 big balls.

I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...

And it won't be pleasant. 



I did what I could for you...

...help you?

We do need your truck.





Alert seventy-fifth rangers.  Code Blue. Tell them Elvis has left the building.

This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...

I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...

Almost quaint.

...happen if I drop this?

They'll get a break tomorrow.

Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?

Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...

...on this miserable road to nowhere.

Where's Arlo?





...like April.  It gives him gas. And make sure there's  two pots of coffee...

Story of my life.  Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that.

You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene.

He was Major Andrew Bryn-...

Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?

Excellent.

Been trying to figure out your secret.

He's brains without ambition...

...the master of his realm.

Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.

Doctor.

So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.

Forty-seven.

Yeah.

Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...

Take it easy, Jake.

If that's what it says.

I said horseshit.  Horseshit.

What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life.

It doesn't hurt.

Tell me. What do the police say?

Where from?

His girlfriend?

Yeah.

Maybe.

You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?

My daughter.

If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.

Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?

I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.

Yes... I think I can manage...

That you killed Hollis Mulwray.

The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.

Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.

Just bring your checkbook.

What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.

I think I'll kill her.

Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...

Thanks, Mr. Gittes.

No thanks.

Where's that?

I don't know...

Okay, you got yourself a boat.

Jake, listen.

I said okay, Jake.

Sue the shit out of 'em.

Well you own a lot of land.

Since when?

Oh yes.

No?

Didn't you call?

Yeah?

Do me a favor, will you, Lou?

Gee, thanks, Lou.

Do you know where she might be?

Yes.

Yeah. Fine, thank you.

Mrs. Mulwray?

What do you mean?

It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?

Looks like you went quite a distance.

A check?

Well, how much would you like?

Why?

You mean you don't know where you were?

You were seeing someone, too.

No, not for that one.

Oh.

Of course I'm sure.

What dam?

No, I think I'd remember.

What? What is it?

Is that unusual?

What were you doing there?

Your eye.

You didn't tell me.

What about?

Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?

I don't know. I mean yes, probably.

...no...

She's my sister.

To Mexico...

With us.

Okay...

He didn't wear bifocals.

He's in the dark room.

Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?

Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.

Perhaps if we could meet your father.

Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?

Maybe he takes it very seriously.

Help yourself.

I cut myself shaving.

Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.

Yes...

Well, no.

What about the water?

Yeah.

Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.

He's not in, Mr.?

May I ask what this is regarding?

He was expecting you?

Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.

I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.

Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.

They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.

I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing  apple core.

Yeah.

All she needed for that was the phone book!

I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.

Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.

Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.

Mortgage Department, First National Bank.

I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?

Well, you never know, do you?

We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?

Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?

Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 

Too bad!

Why? What do you mean?

For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.

I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...

Hi. Why are you running?

Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.

We'll talk about that later.

Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.

All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...

Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!

No...

It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!

Where is he?

I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -

We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?

Please, Mr. Bernstein.

Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.

That's a long story.

Well, well - isn't that nice?

Well, I went down to Atlantic City -

You know why?  She was so -

I'm going back there.

Who said anything about brooms?

Certainly not.

Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.

September the ninth?

That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!

We've got a nice plant here.

It isn't finished?

Of course.

The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.

I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him.  But I'd be better off that way -  - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.

Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.

It may not be about anything at all.

You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -

Too late for what?  Too late for you and this -  this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?  Well, you won't do it, I tell you.  You won't do it!

Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected.  To start with, I'll break your neck.

I'm sorry.  They live here, too?

No.  But you're close.

I was only joking!  This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.

Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.

You're my wife, Susan, and -

Susan, it seems to me -

I'm not sorry.

I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -

Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.

It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -

If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 

You can't.

Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -

Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.

Yes, sir. 

Good.

Charlie -

What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"

I've got to think of Emily -

Why is she leaving me?

Nothing - if she dosen't love me -

What do you mean by that?

You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.

It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.

You won't be lonely, Charles...

Rawlston is my boss.

Was he in love?

Sure.

Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.

We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.

Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.

All we saw on that screen was a big American -

We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -

Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -

Are you serious?

You're shittin' me.

This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?

No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.

Okay. I'm sorry about that.

Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?

Can I join in?

He went home to change for the big date.

Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.

Awww. That was so cute.

Dante. You've got a customer.

Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?

And you came here to what? To comfort me?

But you were.

What?

Sang? His name is a past tense?

So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.

But can we date?

What about Sing?

So what are you saying?

I left like an hour ago.

I can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. That's when the girl found him.  Something smells like shoe polish.

We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.

Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!

Bunch of savages in this town.

Shocking abuse of authority.

No, thanks.

Did you tell Veronica?

What do you two fight about?

She called you Brad?

Your mother.

Oh shit, I've got to place an order.

What about Veronica?

Caitlin's on the same wave-length?

Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.

All right, Vader's boss...

And the second time around...?

Wait.

I told him that and he yelled at me.

Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.

How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?

Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!

You've got a customer.

At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.

Gatorade.

Exactly. They drank it all.

I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.

She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.

No, you're not.

True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.

I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.

If you go, I go.

You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!

How'd he die?

Yeah sure. You're so repressed.

My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.

Reach what?

Listen to you.

Let me borrow your car.

If you must.

Not yet. 

What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?

And this is what you rented?

Because I'm here.

I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.

Because I'm happy.

I'm happy.

I'm not. She just left.

She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.

No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.

I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.

I'll read the book.

Fuck you.

Could be.

WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?

As if it's that easy.

Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?

You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.

Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.

Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.

Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.

Helluva day.

What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.

Yeah?

All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.

Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.

The difference is you exploit a weakness.

A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.

If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.

I'm trying.

I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.

Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?

No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.

Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!

Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.

I'm not even supposed to be here today!

Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!

I don't know-like two-thirty, three.

Hunhh? Nothing.

She called you, didn't she?

Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.

Why do you say that?

These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.

Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?

Three including you.

After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.

It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.

Why do you say that?

I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.

Dante...

Something like thirty-six.

Um. Thirty-seven.

WHAT?

You said you were here all day?

No way.

I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.

Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing... 

I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer?  Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?

He's got his own band in Moscow. It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans" or something like that.

I don't know. I can't really tell from here.

My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.

Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.

Because he's out of shape.

Yeah!

Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...

Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.

You're gonna be at John K's party?

He didn't ask me to...

Fuck you.

So, what do you see?

It can't fly in this weather.

A bad climb, no, just another challenge.  What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.

Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.

Hey, fuck you.

No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!

I was with Jessie, she filled me in.

I did what I thought was right.

Hi, Gabe.

Fine, I guess...

That's it, you look like a professional.

Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?

After the funeral I just had to leave.

Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.

No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.

If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.

He doesn't want my help.

Can't do it.

Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.

Yeah?

Breathtaking.

If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.

This rope is sixty years old!

I've never weighed 135 lbs.!

If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.

Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.

Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.

Right, all the bullets we can eat.

There is.

When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.

What are you talking about?

Tucker and Walker.

There.  You blind?

The monitor! I never ask twice.

Primed to go off right over his head, officer.

Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.

We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.

I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.

Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.

Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.

Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.

Good evening.

And you, sir?

Thank you, sir.

She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The doctors said it was Pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I knew what it was. A victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. Suddenly his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex.

I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.

Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.

A cup of the old chai, sir?

Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.

Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.

That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.

Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.

Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.

Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.

I did, sir.

No, sir, I feel really great.

I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h

Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.

Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.

Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.

Blue eyes, yes, sir.

No, sir.

No, sir.

No, sir.

Crabs?

Through there for a bath.

Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.

Vitamins will it be then?

What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?

I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.

Yes!!!

Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?

Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.

I just say what the other person would say?

Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.

You're not cured yet, my boy.

But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.

You have, my son.

Amen. They cross themselves.

Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?

Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?

Now then. Face the wall. Bend over and touch your toes. Chief Guard inspects Alex's anus with a penlight.

Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.

Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son?

Are you feeling better?

No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.

You got a deal.

Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.

No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?

Most of the time.

Just had one.

Max...

Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?

Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.

You're kidding me.

Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.

I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.

Can't say that I do.

Can you finish on schedule?

Very generous.

...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...

Can you fax me his picture?  His license or something?  What do you mean you don't have that there?  Anybody else in the cab?

So?

Take him down.  Save Richard Yip, our witness...

Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.

Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?

Jesus.  Two in one night?

Pick me up in five minutes.

Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.

No harm done, ma'am.

And you came all the way down here to see me?

Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...

What happens if you don't?

I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...

...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...

An apology.

Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?

Me, specifically?

Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.

Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...

No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.

The trunk?

His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!

It's not me.

Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!

The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...

Tonight it is.

Believe it.

Good luck.  You think they got families?

Lenny, my dispatcher.

I need the job.

I'm not catching a melody.

No.

Leave me alone.

Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?

Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?

She's in the hospital.

Don't start.

It's not bullshit.

I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...

I told you I don't like to talk about it.

See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.

In case <u>who</u> checks?

I don't get it.

Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."

Who?

I don't know.

You had to kill Heller?!

What's at Union Station?

One more.

What happened to you?

But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?

Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.

Mississippi?

I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.

Flip was a hero in Vietnam.

Shut the hell up.

So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?

No.

You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.

I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.

<u>Heart attacks happen</u>.

That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.

Do they have a secret handshake?

I have no idea.

Believe you about what?

'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?

Pretty scary, huh?

Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?

I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?

Uh huh.

Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.

What van?

They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.

So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.

Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?

Okay, I will.

I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.

Thanks.

Not today.

Where are we going, Jerry?

Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.

They'll trace it.

Without a love of my own.

I can't promise you anything.

Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.

Could you be a little more specific?

You've never seen her run.

Well, I don't know if --

It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?

You've asked me that one three times.

I'm sorry.  What was the question again?

Fine.  What the hell is going on?

Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.

You do recognize it then?

Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.

Working.

I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.

I don't like it.  Something's wrong.

We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.

What the hell does that mean?

You don't understand --

Go ahead.  We'll be right down.

Yeah, I do.

Nothing.  I was just making sure. So, who are you?

I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.

I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.

All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?

I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.

Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.

So?

You're --

Goddamnit, they are out there, David --

David --

What?  Why?

Actually I'm running late --

I don't understand.

What would you have me say, David?

No primer.

I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?

Put it on speakers.

Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.

This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.

If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --

Is it possible.  Yes.  But --

We thought this might make things a little easier.

Now... you go home.

But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.

But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?

Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --

I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.

The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.

Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.

Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.

Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.

I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.

Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.

I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.

Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.

Any luck on the grant money?

I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.

Ellie --

It's really happening.

I'm -- I'm fine.

Some of my best friends are scientists.

I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.

I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.

I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.

An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?

I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?

I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.

And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.

I do.

Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.

What is it?

Have your department make a full report.

What are you doin' here?

Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.

Sure he's got kings but you still gotta call him.

You steal a car?

I... I... I...

No, Boss! I won't. I won't. I got my mind right. I got it right, Boss. Please don't hit me no more.

She's got him! You hear that?

Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?

I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.

But damn if he don't look like a fat old Dragline.

That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.

Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.

They ain't never seen a bull gang before.

We got it locked in the sock.

Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.

On my own.

Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.

Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.

Call.

Damn.

This is a big day for the guards. They get to remind us who's boss.

What are you talking about?

Give in? That's our Luke out there.

Only kidding!

What did I do?

A little homeopathic cure for the willies.

Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?

Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?

Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.

When was the last time you washed your hair?

Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.

I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.

Then, why don't you just die.  I'm going.  They'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the TV still on.  Make up your mind.  Live or die.  I'll get coffee.

Tell her about <u>what</u>?

Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?

'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.

What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?

When was that?

You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.

You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.

Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.

Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?

You come and visit.

Where are you, Peter?

You know where.

That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...

If he's not out, why are they here?

What calls?  I haven't made any calls.

Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.

Will you go.  Andy, make them go.

For months... last October.

If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.

I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.

Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?

So far nothing they test for comes up positive.

This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.

One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...

What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?

I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?

W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...

Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.

The Boston Strangler, when was that...?

Why don't you shoot off the lock?

I know, baby.  I know.

He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...

Over here.

Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...

Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...

Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>

Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.

Who gives a fuck?  In all the years I never seen you cry.  You loved him.

Just horseshit luck.

My promise.

Look at him, grandstanding...

Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...

I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.

Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.

Yessir.

Yessir.  I have reflected on that, sir.  Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir.

What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"

It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...

Because I think I'm wrong.

Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.

I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...

So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.

"Spokes<u>person</u>."

She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?

In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.

I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen.

You're not envious?

At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.

It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...

That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.

I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.

The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.

Yes. I didn't plan it that way.

I did this already.

Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.

Then, you should call.

I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.

I have a going-away gesture for you, too.

Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?

I ruined your wedding night.

Wow.   Congratulations.

You've only known Jake a few months.

Paul could pop the question at any time.

I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?

We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.

And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?

Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.

Mom, please.

Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.

It's good exercise, Mom.

I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?

Lie?

It's OK.   It's good to let it out.

No.

Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.

You took bets on my diagnosis?

The lady knows this is a dandelion.

Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.

What are the delusions like?

Your family just met me.

Home free.

I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.

Not a one.

I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?

Open up.    I want to see.

Really?

No.

I'll see you tonight.

You got wine. That's great.

Coming.

No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.

When he could get time off from the restaurant business.

Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.

I guess so.

I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

You should go.

Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?

I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.

Yes.

I think we need to talk about some things.

This has been really difficult, this whole thing. 

It's, it's really nice, Paul.

No, no.

He's a patient here.

I heard about your friend.

I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...

If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.

You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.

I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?

A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.

I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.

Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?

I thought you wanted Zammito?

Not today.   Where are your friends?

Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.

I'm good.   Really.

Supernumerary. It means better than expected.

Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.

He missed three weeks.

Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.

Yes.

Half the tapes.

No problem.

We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.

Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.

I'm just setting my boundaries.

Why do I have to pick up the tapes.

Where are you from?

No one? Then why is Zero here?

Cops?

I can't believe you didn't check.

What for?

It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.

No.

I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.

What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?

Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.

I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.

He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.

Man, I can get anything.

Fine.

Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.

Well, I must say you're handling it very well.

Okay boss.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.

I was told to take what we have and go.

Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?

This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.

Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.

What are we going to do, take a taxi?

I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.

And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.

Cool.

Feel free to correct him if you want.

Watch this.

Where is it, Sophie?

We don't know that for sure.

No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.

So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?

Something like that.

Something like that.

It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.

Stick around and find out.

She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.

A car.

How's the arm?  Still sore?

Wait!  I'm a friend!

This Jade Fox is a woman?

Then leave her to me.

I do as I please.

What's it to you?

So what if I don't?

I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?

Don't invite danger into your father's house.

Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.

Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.

Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.

You're too young to understand.

So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?

How so?

You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.

I was just passing by and wondered how you were.

He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.

How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!

Not another lecture!  On guard!

Give it back!

Give me back my comb.

And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.

It has.  How's business?

Yes.

No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.

But your men are watching over Yu's compund?

But Wudan does not accept women.

Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?

To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.

Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?

But don't be too lenient.

A murderer?

We must avenge mother!

Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.

You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?

Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?

You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know.

You don't say.

My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.

How 'bout the morgue?

This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.

Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.

You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.

Out.  Now.  I gotta work.

No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.

I think he's yours, now.

I went to see a friend of mine.

Mom tried to cook.

I'm looking for a good guitar man.

Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.

Magic.

Yes.

Leave me alone -- !

18k.  Crap.

Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,

Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.

You didn't show it to anybody?

Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.

Forever.

Junior.

You did?

That's a first. Most people praised me for it.

I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.

That's a matter of opinion.

Refreshing.

Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.

Without question.

I will.

Oh please.

I do not.

I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.

I'm sorry about that.

Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.

I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.

Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.

He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.

You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.

No.

I don't know.

Well... not exactly.

I don't love him. I love Ronald.

But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?

That's one way of looking at it.

Just taking your photo.

Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.

Of course. I'm not a monster.

You promised to let me kiss you.

Good night Cecile.

I know.

Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.

Yummy.

Really? Care to make a wager on that?

What, nervous I'm going to win?

Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.

Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.

Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.

Who is this?

I told you I don't know.

But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.

Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.

I see your point... though why should I care?

Sounds intriguing.

Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.

Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.

Be more specific.

What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.

I'm working on it.

Blow me.

What's your plan of attack?

Cecile.

What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.

Yeah.

What's your problem?

It was... Fantastic.

Mock, mock, mock.

No, I'm not.

Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.

I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.

You wanted an answer to your question.

Not that it's any of your business but yes.

Will you calm down?

It's Cecile.

I know. She's so young and he's so -

Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.

It's really important.

Yes, you already did.

We played backgammon?

Excuse me?

Nope.

You're a lucky guy.

Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?

You bastard!

That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.

You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.

Oh, lots of times.

Sometimes.

Do you know the people?

Are they nice?

I got my wish anyway.

I wonder if you don't resent that in her?

I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today  let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?

It's early yet.

Times have changed.

But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?

What?

I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.

I suppose so.

That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.

She said something about that, Mrs. Reed  but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.

And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.

You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.

But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.

It was on account of the birthday party.

They ran away.

Voices from an old dark house!

In the garden? Would she be there now?

Where, Amy? Where do you see her?

But...

But there's no one here, darling.

Yes, darling.

No.

Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.

I'm your friend.

Whenever you want.

Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.

A merry Christmas to you, Amy.

You wanted to share this moment with me.

Yes, Amy.

Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.

That's the clever way to do it.

Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.

But it was alive  it was fast and strong!

If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.

The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.

Then I'll tell you a story  a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?

Good.

No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.

My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.

I can't do it! I can't do it!

Anybody could know that song.

Yes...yes, that's true.

I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.

Go on -- out with you.

I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.

Jennifer gave her a make-over.

Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.

No, it was another woman.

It's not just in my head.

Anything's better than Mark.

Maybe he's just shy.

No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.

What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.

There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.

Did I kill him? Of course not!

I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.

And my bra finally fits again.

My vision got worse again.

No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.

He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.

Give him the tampon test.

Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.

It is so hot in here.

I put it down the garbage disposal.

Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!

No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.

It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!

I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.

Why not? There's been a murder.

You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?

You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.

The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.

So what do I do?

Did I kill a guy named Benito?

Well, whattdaya think?

Yes I do have to pee!

So pee? Here?

On your desk.

Very well then. Is that all?

At least let me give you this back. I washed it.

I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.

No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.

No really, I love knowing what people read.

I can forgive you a bestseller.

Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?

Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.

Interesting possibility.

Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.

I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...

They do? Oh no...

Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.

You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?

I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!

Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?

Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.

Oh, I see... interesting theory.

Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?

No, I said it was our first date.

No, take it.

How big?

We're just trying to figure out what happened.

Why would you want to be a cop?

Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?

She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.

Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.

Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.

She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.

You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.

Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.

One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.

Like a vampire or some shit?

Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.

What of?

He tried to kill me!

Just visiting my patient.

I don't know what you're talking about.

I'm afraid so.

Iíll be the judge of that.  Anything else?

Patricia Crenshaw.

Why, yes.

Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?

It sure isn't the fun-fair.

What is going on?

No...  No doctor...

A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, I can't remember.  Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again...  Now, please leave me alone.

Yes.

Wait, this isn't fair...

Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.

Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?

Well...

Right.

I promise.  I won't.

`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'

) Listen, you little...

I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here.

She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.

Bob...

TilT we figure something out.

Like how?

What about her.

Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...

And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.

Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.

Bob...

... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...

I was gonna do something with Joan.

It's fine.

Why would they do that.  They hired me.

I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?

That'd be great.

Oh my gosh...

I'm not sure... I might have.

Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...

It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.

She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.

Fine.

We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.

She knows.

Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?

Oh... Thanks.

Fertility beads.

Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.

All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.

He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.

Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.

What?

Yeah.

No.

That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?

No thanks.  It's not that far.

There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.

You mean when I'm not running the country?

I run a temp agency.

It was inspirational.

Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.

We're doing our best, sir.

What about the intro?

Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.

No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know.  Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.

Quiet!

Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.

gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.

Gasparilla?

I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.

Datura.

We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.

Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.

We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.

Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.

What you wanna do?

The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.

We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...

Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!

You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!

Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?

So don't goddam come!  Please.

Well, no shit, Sherlock

Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.

At Chet Danburry's house.

So you really think she means you're going with her?

And English, and trig

Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!

Why? Nobody knows who we are.

I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.

Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.

I told you, that's a secret.

Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.

I'm not?

But...

Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?

Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!

My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.

Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.

Knox?!

Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.

You are?  She's glad I called!

All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."

Are you going with Chet?

Then come with me.

Dead Poets honor.

My Word

Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."

A barbaric yawp.

I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.

I have something.

Yeah.  He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business.  But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  As long as I keep my grades up.

Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak.

She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.

Nothing.  No mention of it.

Yes sir.  I'm sorry.

Yes sir.

Where is this cave he's talking about?

That's miles.

My brother went here.

Thanks but  I'd better do history.

A play, dummy.

Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!

Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.

Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?

Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.

We're going to die here! We're going to die!

Who asked any?

Dead.

It ain't any better out there!

I don't know...

Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...

With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?

On the side!!

Oh yeah? What kind is that?

A meat locker.

Right...

Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.

You ain't giving the orders here!

So?

...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.

I don't know...you got what we need?

Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...

A little to the left...

A passenger...

Nowhere...

Hey! You hear me? Come out!

Yeah.

I know...

Good... Pass the beer.

Get the boots.

Hey Geraldine, let's eat!

Nick, Vince, Albert and John.

You're full of shit.

Fuckin' A. It's gotta!

I know, but...

In case!!! The gun's in case!!!

She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!

Married?

Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.

You talk to him?

No.

But you must come in.

Yeah.

How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?

Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!

Thanks.

Oh. Fine.

You know a guy named Merle?

Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!

Inside, Vince.

Rough.  We didn't have to do it, John.

No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?

Nick, she won't say why.

Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.

Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.

Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.

Will you marry me?

Fine. I'm fine. How are you?

I... No. You do this for money?

Playing.

We... Three bullets.

Nick.

Yeah.

I don't think about the shot that much.

Yeah... I guess.

You got it.

It's ahead, Vince.

Then lemme have 'em.

I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.

Same. Hey. Same old stuff.

John Wayne... Listen, Nick --

Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.

Merle gave me this?

Aw, it's a long story!

Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!

Naw.  Uh-huh.

Never one.

One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.

They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths.

Yeah.

The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!

Down.

What'cha got, Bennett?

He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.

Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?

No, you're not model material.  Anything else?

Well, you've just been taken off the bench.

I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.

Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?

You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!

I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.

Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.

What the hell are you talking about?

You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.

How do I look?

Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.

Go in the house.

Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.

But Sergeant...

Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.

There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.

Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.

Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.

I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.

Simulated one.

Says here one of our boys brought him down.  You ever heard of a badge named Wade?

They always are.

Yeah.

It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.

I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.

No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --

They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --

No, thank you -- what's your name?

He lied to me again.

Guess there will, if it says so.

Why? It don't hurt.

No! No! I won't.

That's just too bad --

I did not, Grandma.

Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...

Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.

That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.

You are afraid!

-- of what happens after we die!

But what becomes of our souls?

That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.

A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?

I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.

No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.

But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?

Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!

Well, I --

Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.

Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--

Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?

Well -- yes --

He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.

Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?

You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment.

No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.

Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.

It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.

No, no. I don't want to be idle.

What in sugar hill's the matter with him?

Isn't that your own fault?

Oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone!

Mary!

Hard luck -- like me.

That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?

That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...

Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --

My son! Do you really think, Ma....

Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.

Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.

I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.

Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.

Sure, Ma.

Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.

Very well, folks. I accept.

I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!

You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.

No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?

Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.

She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.

If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --

Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?

Pretty good -- that's perfect!

My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.

Why don't you?

Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.

The past six months.

You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?

Mind if I play some tunes?

That is Christmas music.

It's corny, but I could live with it.

Just remember that when you sign for the tip.  They're paying for it, so don't be shy.

No, sir.

Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --

What does he want?

The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?  I can give him to you.

He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.

This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.

Okay.

Who are you, then?

Go fuck yourself.

I'm going to count to three...

Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?

Gennero.  Miss Gennero.

Don't I always?

I'm ahead of you...partner.

In my youth, partner.  In my youth.

You don't want to know.

I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.

Roy?

What's it look like?  We're going in.

Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!

Heidi - why didn't you come down here?

They're not after you, they're after me.

Jackie - what are you talking about?

The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?

I love you.

Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...

Yeah.  So how are you?

I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?

Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.

He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!

Shit...

You don't have a choice?

Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny!

He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.

What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.

Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?

I'm not alone.

One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.

They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.

Oh, no ... Women is all we got.

Come on.  I want you to see something.

I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.

Calm down... look at this, look at him...!

I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out.  I got superiors, unnerstan?  They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.

Can't land ... you'd kill people ...

There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?

What else?

Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!

We're bringing in your wife...

He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back. 

If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!

It's all we got.

They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.

The TV ... they want to talk to you ...

I guess he didn't appreciate your use of language.  They don't speak that way on television.  It's a rule.  Do you realize you've cut off a valuable source of communication?

They look like good kids.

We like you, too.

No.  I had some legal training, but...

What now, Sonny?

Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my language back there.

It was on the TV.

Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.

Yeah.

No, that's all.

Yeah - it's all right... let's go.

Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?

But I want to know what you think.



What kind of a deal?

Yeah ...

I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.

You follow my car. 

Okay.  Which one goes?

We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready?

Sonny - Here's your document.

What'll you do?  Come out.

Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in prison?

<i>Morning.</i>

<i>Choco grew up on the streets of El Salvador. When he was four years old... he stabbed another kid in the eye-ball with a pencil.</i>  <i>There were wires crossed somewhere in his soul.</i>

<i>I'm gonna kill you, Ed.</i>

What?

I'm pulling up right now. Evacuate the fucking van! Plans have changed! <b> EXT. TEXACO STATION -- NEXT

Yes.

He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.

Turn over your weapon, Edna!

Be kind to your sitter.

Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!

Must you use that awful word?

Stop it.

Where the fuck do you think you're going?

I was a musician.

Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.

You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances?

...THEN SHUT THE FUCK UP!

They're gonna edit it together out of sequence so it's more exciting. <b> EXT. BEVERLY HILLS -- LATER ON

Nobody.

Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.

I'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint.  Ya see what I'm saying?

He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?

We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.

Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?

If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.

Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.

Have you noticed something about them?

Did you ask Sal?

Ask Sal.

Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.

Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.

Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?

Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.

Yo, I'm gone.

I didn't stutter.  You heard me.

You are too crude.

One has nuthin' to do with the other.

I got nowhere to go.  We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while.

Sorry, comb got caught.

How are you holding up in this weather?

I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.

I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.

It's a motherfucking shame.

Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.

Run it then.

Depends.

You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.

You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?

Make dat money.  Get paid.

I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.

Gotta go.

I work too, but I still make time.

What took you so long?  Is it hot?

How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.

Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan?

I can run out and get it.

Tina, I'll be right back.

Da Mayor ain't no bum.

People are free to do what they wanna do.

Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?

That's what I think.

He's right.

I was going to buy a slice.

He's nuts.

Sez who?

My friends laugh at me all the time, laugh right in my face, tell me go feed the Moulies.

I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.

Tell Vito.

Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.

Mookie, you're fucking up.

I'm gonna kill somebody today.

Tell 'em, Pop.

Actually we have something for you.

In the new library there.

Depends how you define 'new'...

Heddo Jeth-ica.

MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.

Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.

Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?

Ooh gross.

Yeah, but I'm buying.

Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?

Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.

Okay, what?

Well la de da.

Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...

It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.

Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!

That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.

Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.

Shift to your left.

Can we eat there tomorrow?

What?

Shut Up! Buttlick!

I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!

Now you see why he was elected principal?

Welcome to public school, my friend.

And he invented fire.

HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.

Yea!

Some what?

Yes.

I bet you want your head scratched.

What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?

Who?

Yeah, that's why I asked.

Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.

How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.

But I ate your Mom's pie.

Do you know what this means?

She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.

PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.

Roger that, Wilco.

And with that complete loser

Damn! What are the odds?

That's gross.

Not to expect you tonight.

I'll talk to you later.

This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.

Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.

"My dream date with Principal Collins."

Skateboard.

He passed away three years ago.

So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.

People! Come on. "Parade" float.

So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?

Yes you are. 

Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.

What?

I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.

The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...

The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...

We felt his presence.

Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.

Basically...

Is this what you seek?

Would you really have drawn my blood?

Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.

They said you were dead.  They said...

My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.

Your Reverence.

Where are we do you think?

The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.

I'm ready.

You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.

No one. It... seemed the proper way.

Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world.

Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?

Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...

Pain.

I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...

What can be done has been done.

Did they try and fail?

Stop him, Jessica!

The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. -- THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke!

It's a pleasure...

Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.

Because I'm planning on dying soon.

Thank you.

Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.

The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...

Do you want me to get it for you?

Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."

So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!

Goulash.

"Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."

Mmph?  Where am I?

Really?

Once you're in it, it warms up.

It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.

Formaldehyde.

No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.

Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.

Eddie, how was I?

I don't know.  Where?

I dunno.  Lie on the beach?

Rolling.

Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.

These shoes are itchy.

I guessed.

I made it up.  It's horseshit!

It's that easy?

Isn't he?

You got the job?!!

Better than not getting a job?

You met Basil Rathbone!

Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.

This is my way of telling you --

<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!

Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.

I don't know.  It's so much money...

Ed, it's just one man's opinion!

That's ridiculous.

Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.

That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.

That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.

Hmm.  Those sound kind of small.  Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her.

What other sixty-thousand?

No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!

But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.

Okey-dokey.

Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.

Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.

Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.

I don't think he's a schmuck.

Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?

Why not??

Huh?

Okay?

Uh, atomic energy?

Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.

No.  I think my film is perfect for you.

Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...

The <u>Ghoul's Wife</u>?!  God, I can't believe I'm doing this...

Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  But this'll be great, I promise!

What octopus motor?

So how long have you known Eddie?

Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?

NOOOOO!!!

Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?

No you're not!  This marriage was never consummated.  I'm getting an annulment!

Oh.  Yeah.  You.

Isn't that the same thing?

Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.

Who?

Yeah, so... ?

Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.

I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you...

Al!

Went --

I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.

Ooh, the sister! She is hot.

Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.

We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!

Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.

I'm not sure about the entire concept.

Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...

I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.

Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --

Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.

No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.

Mm.

But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?

Mom?

What's the matter?!

Oh God. What hospital?

Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!

Shari, Ray feels --

What are you talking about?

Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.

Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.

No, I mean...

I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --

Okay ...

Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.

Well, when you put it that way.

Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?

Why?

Somewhere.

...yeah?

The what?

Everybody's someone.

Come on.

It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.

Where were you?

We're excited.

Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.

Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?

Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --

What's the dif --

Great.

Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.

Please!

Cassie...

Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?

Hi.

What...

So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."

What...

What?... Why?

Hi.

Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.

Sure.

That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.

I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.

Dick... Dick,..

Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?

Thanks, Mr. M.

...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...

Hey, that's super

Right

Aren't you supposed to keep them?

I thought you were supposed to keep them.

Sure

Good luck, Tracy.

Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.

Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?

Why are you lecturing me?

I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.

That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.

Hello, Tracy.

My mother's buying me a new car for college.

Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.

My house.

Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.

Oh yeah, you bet.

Okay, Jim. I understand.

Door was open.

Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?

Here?

Okay.  Give me the drill.

Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.

Should we get a what?

Oh.

Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.

I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.

It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.

For what?

It was Tammy I  That's who it was.

Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.

You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time.  She was always super- nice to me.

Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.

Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.

Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.

It's not what you think.

Yeah, plain scotch.

I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.

Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.

When they deserve it.

You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.

He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?

That simple, huh?

Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.

No.  Now.  You fucked him.

He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.

Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.

How'd you get them to retract?

What work?

Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.

I got to write my report first.

What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?

What was that boyfriend's name?

No!  Please leave!

It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.

Which one are you and which one am I?

Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.

At least not anymore.

We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.

I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?

He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?

I got a few Nite Owl questions.

Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.

<u>Ear plugs</u>.

It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...

Nothing.

I never truck with no sissies!

You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.

Man, what're you saying?

Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.

Gone.  Not a trace.

But you were business associates?

And?

He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.

Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?

She may still be alive, whoever she is.

You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?

Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.

What about you?

<u>Shit</u>.  Someone beat us here.

What?

I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.

Bud White's been here?

Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?

The silver screen's loss is your gain.

You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?

You're the first person to ever call me tough.

You, me and White, huh?

Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?

Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.

The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.

Yeah, it's subtle.

Sid, it's Vincennes.

What's wrong, Trash?

Please hold, Sergeant...

You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.

And no one'll know about this?

Oh Jesus.

Yes.

Nothing.

I'm telling you, I--

Yeah.

It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.

Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.

Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.

And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--

I called my wife!

You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--

Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!

How'd you have the manpower to--

They come after you?

It really is.  Did you find anything?

Who?

Where?

Why?

They shouldn't have come without calling first.

You sure?

That wasn't so hard.

Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?

So what do we do now?

<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.

No.

C'mon.

Is Jerry Delsano in?

The thing is...it really can't wait.

Well then who can?

Law enforcement?

Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--

Yes. I have her permission.

Is that good?

Pardon?

Eight.  Size eight.

<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.

Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--

I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.

Somebody took my blender.

No.

Not that I could see.

Something bad happened tonight.

I saw a man die.

What do you mean?

I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.

I see her for business.

It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.

Was that doctored-up, too?

Yes.

That's okay.

You're as bad as Eric. I've got an entire family of people who root through--

It's over.

A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.

That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--

You didn't squeeze DePinto?

Oh.

I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.

That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.

Eat your fish.

The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.

You don't work there anymore, Bobby.

Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--

--otherwise we may have to--

We'd rather not--

You're firing me.

Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.

Fuck off.

The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.

Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?

Did you take <u>anything</u>--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.

Usually they take clothes.

The blender?

Into what?

Christ!

Calm down.

Go fuck yourself.

Bobby--

Yeah.

I need help.

How can I reach you?

Are you still in Crystal City?

He got hit by a bus.

He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.

Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!

And if it wasn't?

Puffed cheese?

No.

Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?

Excuse me?

He said - be careful.

Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almásy nods.

You bastard, I was believing you!

This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.

You will.  You will.

Would you let me pass?

I can't move.  I can't get out.

Don't talk.

I know.

Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.

You too.  Good luck!

What?

I haven't, no.  Sorry.

I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.

No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!

Her hands and feet were tied.

Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.

What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.

Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.

Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.

We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.

I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.

You were in Africa?

Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.

Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?

You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.

Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.

And you've forgotten yours.

I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.

I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.

Me?

The rest meant nothing to me.

Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't I couldn't even do that properly.

Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.

Yes?

Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.

Really?  That's sudden.

Why?  Is he staying?

Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.

No!

There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.

I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.

I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.

I try not to expect you.

Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?

I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.

I'll always go back to that church.

No.  He's - no.

Hello miss.

A bit of one.

I'm feeling old.

Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 

Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.

How awful.  What will you do?

I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.

I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.

Why?  Are you German?

How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?

There are times when you don't answer the phone.

I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?

Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.

Why didn't I think of that?

He's on to something bigger.

How about if you try disappearing.

Uh, yes.

Well, no...but...

It's not for sale.

You can't.

Possibly.

Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.

Certainly not mine. Come on.

I'm a thief. Sue me.

My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.

As I recall, you've robbed it before.

We're doing this together. We're partners.

You don't get the Mask code unless I go.

I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.

No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.

No. It's a down payment.

Without the Mask it doesn't matter.

Let's just see how we do.

We are...for the tools.

Charged?

Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.

To our...partnership.

My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.

Bookshelf. Sensors--

You're not on the beat.

Shut up.

No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.

Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?

Hold the record. Alone.

Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.

You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.

Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?

Transfer.

Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.

Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.

Feeling old?

Like a woman of mystery.

Can't be too careful.

Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there.

Surgically attached.

Call it a new tradition.

Have really held you under?

I'm not leaving without you.

What about you?

We're supposed to.

I'm waiting for the tell part.

It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?

Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.

Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.

I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.

In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.

Who?

All of 'em?

It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.

Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...

I'll say.  Holy moley.

Wow.  Why would they do that?

Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.

It was right up on the PG&E property over there.

I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.

Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.

Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.

Five million dollars.

Yeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my kids.

I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.

Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.

I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.

It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.

Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense.

And I realized, he's taking a chance too.

-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.

Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.

Kinda like David and what's-his-name?

We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.

Show me the document that proves that.

Really?  It makes me sick.

You didn't care about my case?

They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.

I don't know.  Big.  Dark.

It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.

It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.

Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.

He's got a reputation for doing all his --

Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --

<u>Not personal</u>?  That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is.

I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.

Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.

Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.

Erin --

Say you were wrong.

Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.

Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...

Yesterday.

Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all of 'em.

Corey.

Did he say why?

That's right.

Have you been to the water board?

I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".

So did I.

Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.

What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?

How?

I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.

I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.

Better safe than sorry.

What do you mean?

Fixing a leak under your sink.

It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.

One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.

I didn't say that.

Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.

Thinking.

I can't leave my job, George.

I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.

Mm-hm.

Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.

It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're the only one I trust them with.

Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.

That's okay.  I understand.

Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.

What's going on?

Uh-huh?

Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --

Right, I guess those are the kids --

You did?

Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.

Yes, Admiral .... soon.

Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!

You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.

Ben ... Ben ...

You won't.

Okay, okay.

Barks his Òright on!Ó

Howls.

Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.

Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.

Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?

We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.

You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.

Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.

The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.

Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.

Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?

I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.

No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.

This baby's got a few surprises left in her.

Or you ran into something ....

Would you please stop calling me that?

Here ... near the Anoat system.

It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.

Chewie, do you think you can repair him?

Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.

I always said you were a gentleman.

Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?

Don't ask me, but he's on his way.

You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.

I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.

I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.

You may call me Leia.

You're part of the mining guild then?

We have no use for your kind.

What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...

Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.

Are the coordinates set?

Is there any chance of them surviving out there?

What is it?

We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.

I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.

No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.

No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.

They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.

But I feel The Force flowing!

You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.

Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.

This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.

Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!

Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...

Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.

No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.

I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.

Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.

Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.

You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.

He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.

Where?

Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.

You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.

You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?

And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.

Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.

You don't understand. It's already in you.

Let's just say it's what's best for the country.

A medical team will be standing by.

No.

Lock fuel rods.

I'm here.

It's history. I gotta go.

Does he know how to activate it?

You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.

I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.

We'll see.

Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.

Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.

Sewers. Come on.

I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.

I know that. There are people in some of these cars.

I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?

I sought only not to harm you, sir.

I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.

Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.

Of Merlin?

I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.

Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.

In the great book.

What's this, what's this?!

There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it.

Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?

Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?

Never where you expect it, that's all I know.

I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...

I recognize you only as my son, no more.

Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.

I'm going.

If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.

Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.

There is one.

Twenty days!? The world is that big?

Can it truly be used for magic?

Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.

The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...

People make you laugh?

Why?

I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.

What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.

You didn't ask!

You strike me with words as hard as steel.

Fuck it.

I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.

Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!

Oh great, anything else?

No kidding.

Maybe the circuit is busy?

Of course I didn't.

Storage.

We still don't know.

No. Not at all,

Want to ask him?

Please.

Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.

Karl!!

No thanks Karl.

Yes, I think so.

And those lies she's been telling?

No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?

It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.

Pretty close.

Sure did.

No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.

Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.

What else?

No.

Not at all. Why d'you ask?

Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.

Oh............

I found it.

You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.

Well, maybe he's sleeping.

Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?

You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.

You like him.

Your not gonna marry him are you?

I don't know, I just thought.

How do you know?

Why does God let us get tired?

Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!

There was nothing you could do. Lye down. C'mon.

Stealing is a sin.

I came to say goodbye.

How's the girl?

Sure.

Who's in it?

And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!

You and us.

La plume de ma tante.

Uoy era ohw.

But deliver us from the evil one.

Who places her trust in thee, my God.

Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.

Amen

... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.

Don't listen.

I've seen him.

That's to bad.

Come on!

The Dominicans. Go pick on them.

Are you tired?

Bastards! Stop!

You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!

Yes.

Twelve.

Your pay.

Take it now.

So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.

Suit yourself.

Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?

Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.

Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.

Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack.

My pleasure.

Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.

It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...

You got weird kids, Frank.

Why the interest?

I don't gotta go.

Says who?

What do you mean?

We don't get a gig.

Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.

I don't know what you mean.

I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.

No.

Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.

We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?

I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead.  The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.

It was a somewhat extraordinary day.

Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.

It's early.

She's here.

You wanna get a drink?

So what do you think?

We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.

Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.

Good idea.

Right.

I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?

I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --

Because I can hear it.

No. Why?

She's a big girl.

No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.

Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.

You always threw up.

I don't know.

We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!

I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.

Who's weak now, big brother?

There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...

No.

Yeah, I know.  Me, too.

Spur of the moment.

Just call me a cab.

All right.

Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.

I'm sorry?

Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.

When we know.

What's he talking about?

You can buy new ones tomorrow.

I said I was sorry.

I was gonna split it with you guys.

The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.

We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.

So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.

For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.

First times. Hey, look at this.

Smells like fish.

People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.

Huh?

Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack.

I just saw a man walk out of your room.

I'll call you.

We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.

Gotta go.

So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?

Baker.  Jack Baker.

Regular hours are eight to five.

The name's Baker --

The Stratford.

Every year.

Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.

Hey, business is business.

Guess I got a little scattered.

Better than that.

It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.

Let's make a deal.  You shut up.

How do you know?

Ed? How many people live here?

Huh?

No kidding?

Nervous?

You don't pick your brother.

I've given it up.

Thanks.  For letting me in last night.

What happened to the donut king?

I guess it's getting serious.

He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.

Okay.  How'd yours go?

Yeah?

Merry Christmas.

They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.

You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.

Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."

... Thanks.

Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.

Drive.

Should be.  It's yours.

Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.

We need to talk.

Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.

Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.

No life signs at all. He's a turnip.

Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...

He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.

She doesn't know -- and she never will.

Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.

Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.

You said it, Jon, not me.

Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --

Not if I kill you first ...

Walton, you have to let me see the warden --

Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.

Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?

What?

You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.

Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.

What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.

I'm not going anywhere.

I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.

So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...

Call me spontaneous.

The world can wait, Jon. You're going.

Great.

Good.  Because I'm fed up.

You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.

Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.

Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?

Really. So youre projecting what, a tad over two million?

What about me?

Seven.  Really.

I dont think youre hearing me.

So what are we gonna do, Jack?

Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?

On a case by case basis...

I think I could figure it out.

Thats where you work.

Like what?

Mary Had A Little Lamb.

Great room...

Pretty much.

It wouldnt really be cheating...  Its complicated.

Yes...Jack Campbell...

Yes, thats it...yes, we went to high school together.

The Caddy?  Why dont you take your own damn car!

Hey...

Everyone needs something.

Me?

Thats my car!  You stole my car!

Give me my goddamn life back!

Look, I just want my life back.  Now whats it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Lets talk turkey!  How much money...?

Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.

Uh huh...

You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?

Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...

Because youll be here.

Uh huh...

That is the general idea, yes...

Do you have any idea what my life is like?

If you want to look at it that way...

Thats my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.

I want it...

Its good, right?

Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...

Oh yeah, youre a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...Im gonna take you to that special place...

Are you sure?

Worse, you mean...

And now...?

Thats a big one for me, too.

I guess...some of them are probably faking.

Its wonderful...

Ill just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart.

Im out of the doghouse?

I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...

What are you talking about, Jack?

I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  Well put Annie and Josh in private schools...

Dont worry about it, Jack...

Jesus, Jack...

Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, Ill be fine...

That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...

Where is he?

You suddenly having trouble getting dates?

Do I know you?

But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...

Thats easy. Youve seen my car.

Okay, Ill take them...

Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!

Hey, are you okay?

Is there anything I can do for you?

Of course I did.

So we'll get egg nog.

I've got plenty of places to go.

If it's something you feel strongly about.

Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.

Congratulations. The La Guardia flights canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?

"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."

You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.

I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?

Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --

Five times.

He's made a few changes.

Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?

Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.

Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --

If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.

Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --

This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.

Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?

'Course not.  Strictly business.

Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.

They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.

I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --

Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.

Deb, it's me.  It's still me.

I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.

Is it safe?

Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?

It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.

Oh, it is.

Stay right.  Left is trouble.

Okay, "mom."

Blockhead started it!

Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --

Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.

And if he's not...?

Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --

The number's <u>seventy-five</u>.  And it's applications <u>and</u> patents.

Hilarious.

So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.

Ben did this.

Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.

Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.

That's what we're here to find out.

I'm sure I can come up with something.

What in the world would give me that idea?

With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...

You <u>need</u> a doctor.

Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --

Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...

Raising the shields.

I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...

No...

In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.

It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!

If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...

<Me>?

Here's the Surgeon.

Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.

We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.

Come along, they'll be operating shortly.  See you later, Mike.

Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --

Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.

I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --

And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?

We'll know -- in the next breath...

No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.

He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.

Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --

I have no idea.

No, it requires such absolute precision --

I can't till the hatch is flooded!

As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?

Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.

I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!

I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.

Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!

Yes...

Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?

You mean Inner Space is endless?

"Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man..."

It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.

Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.

They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.

Send the following message...

His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.

That line was tampered with...

I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.

Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.

Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!

Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.

They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.

It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.

Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.

Uh -- what?

Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!

Look at those Walls up ahead!

The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it.  Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage --  -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System --  -- until we reach the base of the neck --  -- where we'll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic.

On the Repeater.

I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.

We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.

It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.

I don't think so. It's nice.

I don't know. Few munce.

What?

Whoa, Daddy.

Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.

I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.

Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -

What the heck d'ya mean?

The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?

Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!

GOT IT?

Yah, but this TruCoat -

This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.

What'd this guy look like anyways?

Can you be any more specific?

Was he funny-looking apart from that?

And what about the other fella?

Uh-huh.

Yah, that can happen.

Uh-huh.

Uhn.

Yah, right -

Yah!

You bet.

Huh? Yah?

...Brainerd?

...Babe the Blue Ox?

Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.

We run a pretty tight ship here.

Sir? Right now?

Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.

I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -

No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -

Jerome Lundegaard?

Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.

It's okay, Scotty.

Yah.

Whatcha watchin' there?

...Who they playin'?

A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?

Jean and Scotty never have to worry.

What's goin' on there?

2:30.

What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?

Yah.

No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?

No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -

No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here, Wade! Jean is my wife here!

Well, I don't vouch for him.

Well - it's cold, Margie.

Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.

Oh, yah?

I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it!

Yah?

Well, yah, I was married. I was married to - You mind if I sit over here?

So?

Uh-huh.

Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.

Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.

Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.

Yah?

They're real good.

Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?

No, no.

Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?

Yah.

Yah.

Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!

I love you, Norm.

Congratulations, Jerry.

Well... Why don't we...

Where's Tyler?

He was killed in action.

Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.

It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.

Does this sound strange to you?

I'd like to thank the academy...

Practicing what?

It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.

-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.

Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.

You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --

You can't have the whole brain!

Really?

This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.

Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.

It was the smart move on her part.

Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?

... A person.

Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!

What is wrong with you?

The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.

I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized

Yes.

My suitcase was vibrating?

Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...

That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.

Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.

Being clever.

The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.

Do what you like.

He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...

Call what off?

My dad.  No question.

"I get cancer, and I kill Joe."

Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.

Any historical figure.

Yeah, I'm sure.

Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.

She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.

Uh... nah...

No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.

No, I'm not...

Fucking sweet.

Newcastle?  Did you start that one?

Homework assignment.

What should I have told you?

Look...

I want to know --

You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.

Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?

What?

You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...

Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.

Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.

I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.

Yes.

Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. 

Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.

Why what?

What have you left for me?

Not my mouth.  Our mouth.

What?

Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.

What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...

No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...

No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.

Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you...

Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---

No, please, no, God, no!

Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.

How you doing in there, hero?

No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.

I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?

Should we knock?

If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...

What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?

Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.

Maybe.  What's this about?

Yeah, so what happened?

There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.

Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!

Clean up?  I don't...

Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.

Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?

That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.

There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!

I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.

I...I don't know.

I know, honey.  I just --

I know, Dad.

I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.

Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.

Nice try, kiddo.

Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.

I'm... really sorry.

Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?

As in flannels and plaids?

No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.

Easy, Billy, just open it.

I don't.

Look, there's something you should all know.

Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?

That's a plan.

Oh, you've noticed it, too?

No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.

In Death...

You saying Tod did kill himself?

Design?

'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!

They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.

You have a responsibility to tell me.

WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!

Huh?

Put it in the guard's barracks.  Man they got pissed.  They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run around.

Really?  How come he didn't take me?

Star Wars?

Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...

Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.

Read you.

AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.

Where's your stuff?

No.

How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?

American?

Nothing we can do, man.

It means "virgin."  My mother was comedian.

Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.

I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.

Oh.  They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.

Nguyen is good boy.

Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.

Let's get that tent down!

Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.

Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.

We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?

We just take pictures?

Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.

Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.

Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.

POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?

Have fun.

Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.

It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.

That's a crock.  We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way.

Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.

I could take it or leave it.

Five.  I never wanted that stuff.

It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say,  "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".

That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.

This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.

Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!

I smell gas... Do you smell gas...

Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...

Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.

You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.

Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?

...<u>Forget it</u>... <u>Goodbye</u>!

Well, what the hell does that mean?

And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....

Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner.  Say!....Anybody up for Chinese?  Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?

My agent.  I called my agent.

He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!

... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...

I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.

All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.

How have you been?

I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.

Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?

Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.

I... I was just leaving.

You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.

Fine.  I'll say no.

No, I have to work.

All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.

Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?

Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?

How much?

What girl?  I didn't notice.

"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!

They're --  -- What?

The Little People?

I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes...

They work for Him.

Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.

Funny -- you look married.

Parry!

Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.

I don't know.

Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...

What are you doing?  Give that back!

Well what am I gonna do with it?

You really want to help me?

No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.

WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!

Who?

Who are you talking to Jack?

Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...

I know!

BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!

I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.

There isn't any more to tell.

You're married.

Divorced.

Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!

It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!

Well, lemme play the other side then.

I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.

You're playing the other side.

What the hell is that?

Is what you?

Okay...

What?

Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?

Washington.

Where are you going?

Alaska? Are you on vacation?

It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...

I didn't get it, did I?

No. How much do I owe you?

But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?

Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.

Are you talking to us?

Am I on TV?

Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.

That's good.

Tita, I've got to go...

A couple of months.

Uhm hmm. Some range.

Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.

You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...

You know, he was formerly a sailor.

I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.

Bye, Robert.

Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.

Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.

Of course I do. It's music. You know...

It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.

Just give me a chance, will you?

Thanks, Carl...

Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.

That's what I mean...

All right, let's have a rematch.

It's a Borzoi.

What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?

I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...

That's an old maid's tale.

Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...

In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...

Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?

Oh, for pity's sake...

Aaron, how you doin'?

Why you have an attitude for?

Wussup.

Hi.

Of course.

You got a boyfriend?

I did.

I can't, I'm gonna get punished more!

Eddie from Baruch, the one who was sittin' wit' dat little girl;

Pitt.

Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?

Yeah, he got a bad attitude.

She didn't say she had no man.

Your friend must be misinformed.

Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.

Jus' from around the way.

By the way: what kind of name is Poon?

You're kidding.

Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.

He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?

I ought to get some sleep.

Nineteen.

They didn't do anything.

Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?

That's Babar.

But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.

Your aunt?

Well, which one?

I'll bet. Shame about Ed.

Oh, he was dying for years.

He was in intensive care for eight weeks.

Just relax.

No idea.

Gum thought Brazil.

Yes, right away.

That's it?

She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.

It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.

This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.

Pretty hefty. Keep reading.

How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.

Check.

Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?

No problem.

Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?

What's that?

I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.

Yeah. Maybe.

Nugent. Ted Nugent.

I'm all ears.

I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.

Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.

You sure got the hard part.

No problem, boss.

You doing a story on this guy?

That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while.

Cute thing.

How long have they been married?

Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?

John Ultrarelamensky.

I love the outfits.

None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.

Hi.

I ordered lunch.

God...

I saved his life during the war.

Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.

I think you should call me Gail, now.

So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.

Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?

I'll take you to a game.

But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.

Bastard.

Don't tell me I can't --

I recommend it.

Lock's busted.

Moved out.

This morning.

You broke it? You know the source?

He's not the story! There's a source behind him.

Well, there we're in a gray area.

It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.

You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.

But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.

My secretary.

Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.

In a minute!

I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...

Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...

So you...

Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...

What did these Vancouver factories do?

Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...

I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...

I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.

Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...

I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?

Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.

Go on, 'they're stahting.'

Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.

You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...

Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.

I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...

I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s

Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.

You gave it to the girls for one.

Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...

As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'

Ye-ah.

Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!

There's that question...

Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.

Why am I what?  Excuse me?  I catch you saying the F-word again.  I'll kill you.  That's a fucking promise.  Now get the fuck out of here.

Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.

Did he just say what I think he said?

Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.

Well, I got some good news and some bad news.

What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?

Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...

Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...

I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'

Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...

Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.

Everything is everything.

Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.

You know I hadda meet some people tonight --

Yeah?

Fuck you, Santa Claus!

Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?

Yes --

Non!

He is not wrong.

What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.

Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.

He got off on six.

What's he do?

You want some eggs.

Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?

Where the hell is it?

Morning.  Sometime.

Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.

Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.

A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.

There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.

Suspicion of what?

I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.

This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.

I can't.

Pour it in your ear.

We put him to bed for the night.

This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.

Hiya, Jesus.

What was it?

I been damn careful up to now.

You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?

Nicky Moore.  Patty Ryan.  Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you, asshole?  Julia Sullivan!  She mean anything?  She means something to me!

There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.

You alright?

The usual.

One in each ear.  What would you do without me?

Wish you weren't.

Frank...

Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?

He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...

Frank, please...

No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW.  Come get me.

Next time lets put some money on it.

I know.  Sorry, Dad.

I'll be up soon, Little Chief.

Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.

Wait...

I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!

WB2YKXB, who've I got?

I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.

I got fed up with all the bullshit.

Hello?

Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...

Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.

W...B...2...YXB.

Nothing...I just spilled something.

What?

Yeah...I think so.

I never knew you, Dad.

Fire.

No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.

Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.

I don't know...  What about the other women?

No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.

What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?

Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.

You really wanna know?

It's not your fault, Dad.

John, he's got my driver's license.

In my pocket.

How the hell am I gonna do that?

Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.

I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my Dad.

Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.

Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.

That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.

This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...

Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.

She's pretty special.

I try to be.

No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.

You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...

It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.

Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?

We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?

Where's Shelly?

You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.

Yes, man!

Your bed.

Somebody was in here.

Are you all right, Shelly?

Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.

The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.

I'm trying.  I'm really trying.

My whole world.

Destroy the evidence, Pronto!

Everything's gonna be fine.

Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.

Maybe.

Damn you, Shelly!

Who's Horace?

That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.

Happy Friday the 13th.

Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.

Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.

It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.

What's it to ya?

No.

Nancy.

No more.

Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.

Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."

Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.

Please don't do anything crazy.

Yeah...They should've paid their bill.

How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?

Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?

Do you have to ask?

Why don't you blow me, Chief.  After your girlfriend gets through.

That's what I'd like to know.

Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.

I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around?

Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?

I'm now begging you.

Until I hear the truth.

About what?

She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!

Really?

He bought you that?

My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.

Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...

Never mind, you don't want to know about it.

I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?

So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?

No.

Rennie's not coming.

Don't be ridiculous!

Nothing.

They're out of town.

I packed it. Just for us.

But I haven't even shown you my biology project...

Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.

Where is she?

She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?

What are you talking about?

Perfect for a swim, isn't it?

She didn't push me into coming.

But Sean said...

I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.

What about not-so-great writers?

Just felt a little chill.

I don't know what to say...

Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...

We changed our minds.

What do you mean???

Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.

Very big.

Very bad today.

Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.

I don't want to hear about it.

Asbestos lining.

I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.

I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.

It's your best play, Nicky.

There are things that speak to us from the past.

About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.

She was very evasive.

I hear Alan's sick.

She's dying.

The Red Sox

Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.

In and out of bed.

I go to college. I thought you knew.

Why do you need a radio?

And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?

You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.

Take it yourself. Take a date.

It's only our first date.

Packs an emotional wallop.

All right. What's been going on?

I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.

I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.

I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.

This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.

Life is good.

Pop, will you let me in?

Right here. At the door.

It's me. Nicky.

The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.

I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.

Show him who we are.

This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.

What am I doing?

That's my cousin, Angelo.

It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.

Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?

It's a simple subject.

Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.

I want to believe.

Because faith is rewarded.

You're out of bullets.

Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.

To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.

Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.

I was educated by nuns.

Burnt sienna.

I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.

I think I remember.

Engaging.

He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.

Is what true?

Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.

Our Steven not only disguises himself.

The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.

Mr. Khan said they called you brave.

Everyone takes his turn.

Eleven.

Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.

No. That is what you get for distracting me.

I'm sorry.

Well, we shall try.

Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.

Did they take your clothes?

Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.

A -- a week.

Panditji -- please, help me.

You will respect the law.

Even as a boy I thought so.

I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.

You should ride the pony. It is not necessary to walk to prove the point.

No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.

An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.

That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.

I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.

That was England.

Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?

I dined at the prison.

Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.

I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.

Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of "Free India." Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt.

...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.

I like football.

Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.

A man's dead, Detective.

So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.

With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.

None of the ID photos match the enhancement.

No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.

Thank you, no.

No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.

This time I will supervise each test personally.

What's wrong with him?

At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.

The place is crawling with Hoovers.

You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.

I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.

You know I'm scared of heights.

What are you talking about?

I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.

Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.

She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.

You may as well invite her here.

How long?

I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.

How would you like to be yourself for the day?

German, is that you?

I've found him too.

They found an eyelash.

In the South Wing.

What exactly is wrong?

I guess somebody beat me to it.

It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.

Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.

There's a problem, Lamar.

I'm not doing it.

This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...

Stay clean.

They may nail me into this now, McCoy.

I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.

Yeah.

What do you mean? You've never been there.

Just the way I remembered.

It's all right.

Suit yourself.

I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.

Want to cry now?

My mind's not on guessing games.

I've never "been there... When we met it was in his office.

You sent me to him.

She's on TV.

It isn't another boyfriend, is it?

Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.

When are you going to learn?

Let's do it.

I don't want to hear it.

You want to try with me?

Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.

Where do we go from here?

Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.

We walk.

No, I'm afraid not.

Thanks. Hope you do too.

Tell her you robbed a bank...

Two boxes of double-ought buck.

You were with him?

What about you?

I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.

Whatever you need.

Suit yourself.

Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.

How about twenty thousand?

Just... tell us what you want.

I'll tell you when.

When did you find out?

Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.

Nothing. What could I do?

Was the steering faulty?

What?

Yes.

Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?

Fine...  I want to talk to you.

What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.

I can't.

Yes. I can't help the way I am.

What?

Really?

While he was here. You went about together?

So where are we going, Princess?

We're there now.

Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Your brother? What you talking about?

The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.

Nice of you to come.

Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.

No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.

They said he was drunk.

No.

At me friend's house.

Wilton Estate.

Yes.

Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.

No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.

Oh yes? How?

I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.

I see.

It never is.

No. Really, I am.

What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?

What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?

Not much.

How could I stay away?

It would be. If they were still living.

A bereavement. A death in the family.

Can't say I do.

Still got your sense of humour.

No? Funny that. Neither did I.

I have to. Things to see to.

Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?

Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.

That's right, Harry.

Three hundred altogether, Harry.

Ha.

That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.

Shut up.

...Polacks...

...they hold on to their money...

Mmm...

I...I don't know.

You get a bad month, all of a...

All of, they got you on this "board..."

I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.

Eh...?

Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."

...cower in his boots...

Yes, it is.  And you know who's responsible?

Himself?

The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.

Men come work for you...

What?

Graff?  Because I worked for him.

No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?

As a robbery.

That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.

No.

...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.

Absolutely.

Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.

Then tough luck, George, because you are.

Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?

Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?

Well, they're old.  I saw the shit that they were giving you.

Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.

You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.

They stole the...

What?

No.

Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."

No.

When I talk to the police, I get nervous.

You think so?

Where did Moss...?  I...

We had a robbery. 

Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.

'Cause, you know, 'cause they weren't, I know that Mitch and Murray uh...

Go to lunch, George.

...did they...

Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.

Levene!!

I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.

I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.

...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?

It isn't me...

...let me...are you listening to me...?

Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...

The leads are assigned randomly...

I can't do it, Shel.

What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.

And fifty bucks a lead.

No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.

I saw the board.  You've got four...

I have to go... 

I can't split them.

It's better than a good sale.  It's a...

All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.

You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?

You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.

What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.

You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...

What are you talking about?

Well, hadn't it?

I don't know what you are saying.

I'm sorry.

Eighty-two thousand dollars.

"Bruce, Harriet...Fuck me, believe in yourself..."

Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...

Fuck is that supposed to mean?

You sold eight Mountain View?

They took the phones...

Like you taught me...

Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...

He's right, Williamson.

I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...

Beautiful.  Beautiful rolling land. I was telling Jim and Jinny, Ray, I want to tell you something.  You, Ray, you eat in a lot of restaurants.  I know you do... 

Which...

Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...

Kenilworth.

I'm coming, Ray...what a day!  I'll call you this evening, Jim.  I'm sorry you had to come in...Monday, lunch.

It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...

Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.

You tell me again.

We're going to speak to her.

Yeah.  He closed a deal.

You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...?

Who said "Fuck the Machine"?

The...

Yes.

You did?

To the restaura...what do you fucking...?

'Cause I don't have to eat this month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to me...  Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all...

It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...

John...

To do business.

We have no money for a rug.

If you like, why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I guarantee he will accept that amount from me.

Connie.

Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?

Because I need MONEY!

Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.

I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?

It's not talk; I'm doing it.

You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...

We're making an investment in Havana.

Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.

It was Frankie tried to have me hit.

...Who?

But, you told me yourself...

It's the way Pop wanted it.

In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.

Chi?

I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.

Am I a prisoner?

Kay... Kay...

When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.

I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.

Yes.

I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.

Wait... there's something else.

Mike, at three and a half...

Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.

I know he's in Israel.

I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.

Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.

Twenty-five this time.

Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.

He's going to try Panama...

Did my brother go back?

Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.

You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.

Do you gamble?

Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.

This meeting is adjourned.

Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.

Sleeping inside me.

Yes, Michael, it does.

I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.

I'm not going to stay long; I can't.

You would have killed his brother?

I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.

I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?

You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.

I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.

Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.

Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.

Let him gamble.

I do not.

It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?

Turnbull is a good man.

I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.

The same assurance we got from you.

How much more a month?

What's to be jealous of?

Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.

You mean us?

I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.

The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.

Tea is fine.

That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?

Long enough.  Fifteen years.

No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?

Of course.  I am married still.

Well...no, not really --

But I didn't do this!

Mornin'.

Yeah.  I better get on with my work.

What?  Oh yes.

This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.

Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?

What was wrong?

Huh?

You mean -- you really want to draw me?

And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?

Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.

You don't say?  Which picture?

I'm not wearing an undershirt.

Sounds like something you feed the dog.

Did you now?

Did anyone laugh?

Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.

I don't like to talk about that.

Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years.

I'm not, you know.

You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.

No.  I --

I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.

The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone.

You've done a helluva lot more than most people.

How long were you...?

You first.

I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.

There's no people like you in my crowd.

You're talking through your hat now.

No, my dear.  The Crimean War. What do you think?  The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had --

You're the one who started it.

You asked me to model.  Remember?

You don't want me to sit for you anymore?

I'm game.  Sure.

Clayton is fine.

Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.

I thought you'd given up on my picture.

But you said --

I'm very sorry.

"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."

You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.

What won't do?

Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.

Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.

Oh Clayton.

Pray you, undo this button.

You ever hear of this Whale fellow?

Then who did?

Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?

Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.

Just go.  We can manage without you.

Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.

I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.

Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.

You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?

I guess.

Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.

Righto.  Let me see.

Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.

I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.

Is there someplace we can talk?

About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --

A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?

I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...

I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?

I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...

Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...

I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...

I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...

You got no choice. It's over.

How is he?

Let them go. And I'll leave ...

I don't think so, Detective ...

Needs brightening ...

Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...

That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...

It's all microchips and shit ...

Hey, Donny --

Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business

How you doing, man?

That's right. Only 10 exotics ...

I know. Weird, huh -- ?

There's no one left ...

one minute -- !

It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"

You, too, Ma...

I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?

What time of year?

You remember that, Kip?

We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all

I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.

NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.

You guys are through...

Yeah... You want a ride...

You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?

Don't go there, Toby --

Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...

Yeah --

What do you got ... ?

You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail.

Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...

I'm cool.

Sure, man --

Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like

What for -- ?

Run it...

Yeah. He's knows of one all right.

Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -

Where we going -- ?

The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...

On account of me.

Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.

Hey -

What's wrong with her -- ?

Oh, yeah.

I think so... They're just... So ...

They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...

Wrong preposition...

And Tracy's on the move ...

What's that?

And the moral of that story is -- ?

His criminal career has officially come to a close ...

She left...

Not really -

The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.

Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.

Oh I Him.

Wha?  Me?

Me? Why would I get into that shit?

Paulie. Why would I? I swear.

Nods.

Nods again.

But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...

Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.

Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.

Jezuz Christ!

Let her carry this shit inside.

I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.

But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.

You know. The stuff I left.

Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?

I got scared.

Paulie was just talking about him.

There are cops all over the place.

He heard.

I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.

He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.

Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.

He's okay. They sobered him up.

Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.

He's with his friends.

Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.

I got dry cleaning.

Please?

No, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home. Fuckin' lights and everything!

That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.

--or a tail--

Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.

Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude. I'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em. You know how many people try to whip Morgan's ass every week? Fuckin' kid won't back down.

You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.

This is your house, right?

She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...

I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.  Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--

Yeah, it is.

Yah, all right...

Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?

What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!

The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.

I'm Irish.

Shut the fuck up.

Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.

History.

Good, it was all right.

Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.

Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.

Seven.

Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!

Which one's your building?

Well, he didn't show up for work today...

An integer.

I don't know what it's called.

I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.

I appreciate that.

Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.

It's Saturday.

Pleasure to meet you.

No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.

Since Nancy died.

This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.

--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.

He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--

Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!

--And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!

--I don't have any anger at you--

He's not you!

Come in.

Me too.

I don't know. India maybe.

I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.

I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.

He was my roommate in college.

Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.

Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.

Like what, Will?

What places?

I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.

If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau."

You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free.

This is a real piece of shit.

You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.

You've never been out of Boston.

You've never been on a plane.

Fine.

I don't know.

Haven't called her.

I gave that up when my wife got sick.

What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?

Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.

I was havin' a drink with my future wife.

"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?

Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.

What?

I didn't want the job.

It's not your fault.

Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?

I kind of got that impression.

What?

You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?

In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?

No.

Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?

You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

Bullshit.

I'm sorry, I been real busy.

No.

All right, all right. We'll go.

Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance.

Not tonight.

I guess so.

I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.

No.

Yeah, but how do you know?

And you're sure about that?

One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--

What am I scared of?

What the fuck am I afraid of?!

Joe!

I'll get Rosasharn.

Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?

Watch me pass that Chevvy.

Don't hold me so tight.

You're *ticklin' me!*

Now I can't breathe.

People done it. If they could, we could.

Well, we ain't out a it yet.

I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.

Gallon or two?

Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?

Two.

Which way is House 25?

Joad. Tom Joad.

We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?

An' you say no cops?

Say, who runs this place?

Anything like work aroun' here?

Have a little snort?

Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.

I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.

He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.

I ain't no preacher anymore.

I ain't gonna run.

You're right!

Thought you was in jail.

I dunno. Payin' five now.

We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?

Want to work, do you?

Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?

It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 

Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?

All but me! I'm a-stayin'.

Ain't a-goin', thas all...

'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.

I'll walk back.

You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.

Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--

Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?

Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 

That's right. And douse some in it.

Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.

Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 

No.

On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.

He was a good man.

Good-by, Tommy.

Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.

Well, give me two then, ma'am.

I know that! But *where* they gone?

They come. They come and pushed me off.

Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.

But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.

Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.

I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.

Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?

Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!

Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?

I won't--  --if you won't tell what *I* done!

We can pick anything.

Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.

In the corporate offices.

I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--

I'm Martin Blank.

Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?

Overflowing with love.

It's nice to see you again.

Not much else.

I'm a professional killer.

No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?

Yep.

Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?

As long as I get the laugh.

I'll just help myself to a cocktail.

--She's not dead---

You're a government spook?

Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....

Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!

I'm staying here.

You don't understand...

It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?

Shouldn't you be taking notes?

Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.

We're both professionals, Oatman.

Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.

Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.

Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.

I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!

It was the PLO.

That's going to cost.

He didn't.

See you next week.

Paul?

You too.

Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?

He gave me a great deal.

Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.

To shoot you. Correct.

So what are you doing with your life now, son?

That's good.

Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.

Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?

You ever just stand still for a minute?

Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?

Does Chicago count?

When I was first married.

Well, I, uh... you didn't...

No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.

You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?

That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.

How did you find out all that?

I can't do this. I can't leave you...

The point was to love each other.

Okay.

Is that your version of a pep talk?

Fine!

Maybe they should put me down too.

I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?

-- enough time tomorrow. I know.

I don't care.

You were never thirteen, Mom.

What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!

Then why do you want to leave?

I think they call it a pasture.

You already did.

Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?

I'll take care of it.

... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?

I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.

Yeah, well, you've done a great job.

My period.

So do you.

Good.

Who's there?

If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?

All right. Speak to you then.

That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?

Yeah. Bye.

She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...

No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.

No, let me go.

Doing what?

All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.

Yeah.

I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.

He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.

Why?!

Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!

No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.

Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.

Everything all right.

You're allergic to hay.

You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.

No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.

Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?

What do you mean?

Oh, I don't know...

Either fight the way things are or accept it.

Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.

I was there for that shot, actually.

Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.

Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...

You!

Diane!

Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.

Sure. As long as she don't mind.

Yeah.

He thought it was a ghost.

I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?

I don't know if I can with my leg.

Sure.

You want to go to a movie tonight?

So?

No, I'm just not that hungry.

NO!

You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!

I understand...

I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.

You ever miss it?

Yeah, cool.

It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.

Hackers of the World, Unite!

Yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!

What is it with this guy?

Yo, brain dead, the manual!

Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.

Go fix the phones.

No, don't know who he is.  Do you?

Dead?

I'm taking over a TV network.

No. No one special.

Nah. I don't play well with others.

Never heard of you. Done anything?

What's going on?

Burn!

And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...

Think you can do better?

You're the moron that's been invading my turf?

It's cool, I'm just looking.

The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.

Razor and Blade! They're flakes!

It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.

Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.

What?

I think we've got something.

We caught 'em.

As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?

You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.

Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?

Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.

I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.

I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.

Sh, sh sh sh sh.

Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.

Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.

A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.

I don't know Brady.

Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.

Its too late.

I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.

Drive Carefully.

No way. No how.

Al here lost his boy 10 years back.

You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers.

Like a sister?

Like a real sister?

I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.

Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.

I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.

But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.

Coming.

This is great Rachel. Come on.

Oh Rachel!

Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.

Dad, what's going on?

All right.

Hi.

Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.

Isn't this all a little paranoid?

Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...

He's here, Sheriff.

10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.

Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.

Be here in a minute.

Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?

Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?

Don't touch him Jamie!

We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.

Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.

I have a place for that.

The guys think I'm too smart.

Okay. Bye.

Why did you hang up on me?

Of course.

Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.

Bye.

I wasn't spooked.

I can't.

Come with me.

Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.

Will you call me tomorrow?

Lee Brackett.

May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...

He isn't a man.

You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.

I think you have too much to do tomorrow.

I don't think so...

Sure.

I don't like that story.

I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...

There was no one outside.

No! Do as I say.

Will you get her for me?

I'm wasting time.

He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.

Are there any special instructions?

Only minimum security.

He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."

I can't believe it!

I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.

Are you really interested?

Look at this.

A lot of works.

Oh, is that what it is?

Yeah.

Uh...

Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.

Right.

Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.

We're actresses.

Really?  Is the food that bad?

I'm an architect.

It's terrific!

And it ruins everything else.

Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?

Oh, okay.

Let's take a look.

When did you first notice this?

Uh-huh.

'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 

I don't know exactly.

Ohhhh!

Oh.  Well, I live--

Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.

Oh, God.

No, I don't have time.

You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?

Yes?

Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.

Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.

Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...

Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one. 

Yes, he's just adorable.

Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.

I have been in love with you for so long.

Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.

Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.

Aren't they great?

Let's go have dinner, shall we?

Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.

I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.

I don't know.

Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?

Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.

Always.

We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...

Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.

No, nothing.

Yeah.

They're in the basement.

Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.

I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.

No.

Stop accusing me!

Jesus...Jesus!

You know... 

No--

Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...

I think they're fantastic.

Okay.

Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.

You are, Holly.  Stop it.

Here, you guys.  Open them up.

Yeah.

H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...

Football!

Could you have ruined yourself somehow?

W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.

No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.

No, no, we decided!

Yeah.

Uh-oh.

Here.  Be careful with those.

Well, how about this?

Singing?

You know.

What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?

Look, everything's going your way.

You got it.

I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer."  I mean--

Hmm!

Uh, losers!  All losers!

I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.

No!

Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.

We didn't hit it off.

How are you?

...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.

Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.

Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?

Oh.  Oh.

Oh, well.

I am.  You-you made my day.

I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I-- 

Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.

I don't know how you're gonna top that.

Oh...

Take our literature...

...read it over, and think about it.

They're offering... 

...I was <u>working</u>...

I have not read you your rights.

Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?

...what <u>hindered</u> you...?

Orderly.

I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.

He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.

He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?

Say it in English.

Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?

All y'got to do is <u>ask</u>... 

Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...

Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?

He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...

Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.

Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>? 

Seen what, sir..?

Waal, Nobody's <u>Perfect</u>... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?

Have the child taken to bed.

Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.

....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...

Mmm...

Starling...?

...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?

Well, you know, that happens, on the street.

That could be.

Said what?

How's your <u>child</u>?

'bout time you <u>learned</u>...

Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...

Hey, you know, I never thought of that...

A wonderful country...

You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.

Why did you look at me that way?

I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?

Enchante.

...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.

They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...

I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...

Thanks to <u>you</u>...

It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.

I want the <u>same</u> drink.  Cause it did me <u>good</u>... but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like another.

That's what I should do.  Tell me why?

You're going to <u>do</u> that?

...something about my <u>father</u>...?

Every suicide kills two.

You got a lot of people love you, Starling.

...<u>what</u>...?

...and that is what you need to expand.

Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...

I'm sure I don't know who you mean.

What shape is the scar?

Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.

I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 

No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.

Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin <u>home</u>, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to <u>take</u> her there...

I know it well.

It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence.

Dottore Fanelli...

And what does <u>that</u> mean?

...no...

No, I don't <u>think</u> so...

How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 

Welcome to the human race.  Do you know, there are people who admire you?  Reasonable people.  Why don't you <u>find</u> them...?

That's right.

What is your point?

When?

Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere....

Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.

And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.

Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...

Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?

I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.

You are the prince of the darkness.

Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am...

It's about time. Isn't Fun great?

What are you gonna do about it?

You guys have been so colossal...

Your Secret admirer?

Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.

Thanks a lot. Seriously though, by winning this bet, you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything.  Isn't the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life enough?

Don't get cocky, girl.

That's bullshit. Just shoot.

No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.

Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.

In my heart, Heather's still alive.

Uh-huh.

Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.

Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.

Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.

I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?

We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.

You goddamn bitch!

King David.

Is she dead?

You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.

Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.

People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...

Give me the clipboard.

Suicide is a private thing.

Sure.

No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.

Maybe it's time for a vacation.

Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...

My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.

I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.

Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?

I was just making it more special.

She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.

Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?

Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.

Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....

What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?

You didn't say Simon Says.

Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?

May<u>be</u>. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.

This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.

Where is he? Where's J.D.?

But my name's not...

We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?

Come on through.

Look who I've found!

She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .

pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.

leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.

comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.

I'm not hungry.

Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?

She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.

I don't wanna be in bloody school!

That's enough, Yvonne!

Thank you so much!

I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!

turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.

I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.

Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!

No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!

You mean travel by ourselves?

Hurry up! I'm freezing!

I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.

Your insight is enlightening.

Okay so... what's the safest place?

You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.

Well?

Did I ever talk about Kirsty?

What was it?

No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.

What?

Really? Do tell.

What's the occasion?

I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 

I've been in here before.

Where's Allison?

I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.

How many zeros was your wife worth?

What's that?

Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.

Really? Why?

There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 

For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.

Where's my wife?

Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-

Wow you are out of it.  

What things do you think you've done?

I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.

Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.

Hey even if it is more power to ya.  Alrighty then. Have a good time.

YOU!

I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...

One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?

I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.

Right.

Huh?  Whadda you mean?

I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.

He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.

We can hope.  You still have your job, right?

And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.

I understand.  How often do you see your son?

Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.

I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..

Mister LaPlante...

'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why.  I'm broke, plus I got legal problems... Nobody was asking for me, huh?

Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.

The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.

You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?

I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.

You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --

Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...

Me!

If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...

He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...

A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...

You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.

Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.

"The Nomm"?  What's that?

I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?

Bodybuilding!

No, John, you're too hard on yourself.  I've got the creep here, the guy who's...

Yeah, I got it.  Sports training. You learn to follow the ball.  How about you do a wrap-up from up here?  I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.

"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."

Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?

You said all the passengers were accounted for...

No, Deak, not a great story.  We backed this guy, he's our boy!  We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars.

What?

You didn't?

Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!

Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.

Who?

Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?

It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.

Yeah, that was easy.

Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...

"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"

'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'

Uh huh.

Why are you mad at each other?

I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.

Mom, I heard someone downstairs!

You wanted furniture too, didn't you?

You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.

Paul Newman in "The Hustler."

Damn.

What?

Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.

Oh baby.

Oh, honey.

This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!

There's always an excuse, isn't there?

We'll talk in the morning.

Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.

Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?

What about cable?

And I can't help having a cold.

Thank you -- how efficient of you.

Promise.

Really.

Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.

What?  Who are you?  What do you want?

We don't have any proof of that.

Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.

Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.

Central Park.

Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.

There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.

That's all?

And what do you think you will find in another land?

No -- I will.

She's a treasure she is.

I would like to say goodbye.

Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?

And what would'st I gain from this bargain?

I lied.

Where do you go when your mind drifts?

What are you hoping to find inside?

No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..

Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?

It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.

Because it's my name.

Jennifer.

You remind me of someone I used to know.

About what?

You look like you have.

I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.

I know.

No.

I've seen it.

Get out.

Why?

What's that next to him?

I know, Paul.

It will not end tonight.

It's not for me to decide.

I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.

You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.

I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.

Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?

Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.

The best.

Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.

<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.

He knows better than that.

Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.

Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!

Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?

I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.

I'm not going to die for this!

How about the cop?

I'm here.

That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.

We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.

My father.

Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?

Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.

You can't run with suitcases.

Dennis.

Keeps to himself, more like.

It won't be a problem.

Give me an ETA.

Yeah.

Where is it?

You'd better be kidding.

You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.

I don't drink beer.

What I want is to help my father.

Stop it.

I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.

Whatever.

Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.

Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.

Chief Talley is the one who got you out.

York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.

We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.

Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?

Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.

Go, Chief.

Go.

They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.

Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.

Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile.

Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.

Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?

Then I think we should wait.  Do you agree?

You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call.

Goddamned small town bullshit.

What?

They've been in there all day.

The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?

I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.

Try Al.  See if you can open Al.

Who is it?

Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.

We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.

I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!

We, who is we?

Let me see your identity card.

Yes, it is a calamity for us all.

Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.

Let me explain.

There is nothing to it.

You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.

No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.

Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.

Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.

We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.

What's happening?

Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?

And what will they do with these satellites?

Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.

You said you had no whiskey.

Whiskey?

Get in.

I am on a list! What list?

I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.

I saw the sign.

I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.

Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.

I need a great favor.

How do you know?

They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.

I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.

He wants your wisdom.

Homework?

He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?

Jean Baptiste!

Dawn. Then they go.

Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.

What for Paul.

What?

I want to know.

A Volkswagen!

Please do not talk like this.

What's wrong?

Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.

There is one thing I need right away.

What's wrong?

It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.

Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.

The lieutenant wants the register.

Many beers.

When?

The staff, the guests.

Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.

Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?

Go downstairs, I will help you.

If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --

So what stopped her?

So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --

Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...

Not at all!

Yeah...something.

Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.

Is she alright?

Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.

-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!

Yeah, me too.

You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!

I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.

-- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.

Nothing.

Yes.

The...Fourth of July.

Poor Mr. Price --

Yeah. But, hey, anybody who's not "comfortable" with the rules, you're free to walk, anytime. Seven digits poorer, goes without saying.

-- yeah, we did that --

No...not air --

-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.

-- listen to the man --

Let's try down here...

Better living through electricity.

That's crazy!

He's dead...?

Jesus!

Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.

Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.

Asking the wrong person again.

You didn't think to ask?

I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.

What?

You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.

-- confirming everything we already know --

It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!

-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.

Why not?

You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.

Blackburn's dead.

Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?

It might have been her mother.

The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?

Yes.  It was.

No!

Yes.

We'll get it later.

Go to your room!  Now!

Where is she?

He's blessing the house.

That's great, honey.

It's dark!  I can't breathe!

Good night daddy.

Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal -

I just, I don't know...

To our family.

Ok.

It was in the cellar.  Weird.

Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.

Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.

I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.

What about keeping an open mind?

Are you ok?

What's happening!

Maura.

Yes, I am.

Why?

So what should we do, father?

Come back to us honey!

How can I help you?

Thank you.

So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!

It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...

Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -

Yes, they are.

It was nailed to the cellar wall.

What?

Jesus Christ ...

OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.

And what is ... this frozen moment?

Then tell me what to do.

The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.

It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.

Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...

Sorry.

Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?

Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.

Who's that?

And he still sits there?

Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.

What else came with it?  Anything still here?

Can we see?

You're JP Monroe, right?

And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.

The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?

Unh-unh.

Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.

What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.

Hey, that's what makes the world go round.

But how in God's name ...

Really?

I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.

Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?

Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.

It was so beautiful!  When the blanks went off, they...

It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.

Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.

Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this.

Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have to change them.  "Witchcraft." What's the running time?

No need.  Guards' station's right there.

"Every day you meet quite a few."

Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...

Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...

You sound disappointed.

"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"

Anna, I think you better stay....

Let's just forget it, I mean...

Too-do-loo, babe.

It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.

George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...

Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....

I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.

He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around...

God go with you, sister.

Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.

That's what you theenk.

Never, why do you ask?

Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.

Oh, I'm so sorry...

Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...

Oh.  Well, what's this?

It's that kind of selfish attitude that...

This is too bad to be false.

Trust Leonardo....

Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.

When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...

Actually he never told us what it was.

Baseball, why?

But you're going to tell us anyway...

The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.

Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?

You certainly do.

You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me?"  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!

And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.

When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.

You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.

Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...

We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.

Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --

Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...

Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!

Not at all. You're light as a feather.

Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --

No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --

Why yes, do you know it?

Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --

Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.

...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?

Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.

I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --

I know that, Amy.

That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...

Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.

Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --

Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --

Consider this my resignation --

Norville!

Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!

I don't know...

What the heck they doin'?

It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.

Well, I --

Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --

Yeah, but, buddy --

Get up!

But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!

Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --

Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.

Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.

-- tough titty toenails!

'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'

I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!

I --

There's one in every story.

She sits down.

Maybe he's wise.

Plan two: Here come the waterworks.

Thank you for waking me.

Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.

But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?

Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.

You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.

Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.

I've never heard of a cure.

Thank you.

It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.

Yes.

Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.

No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.

I like her already.

It's my day off.

I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?

By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.

That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.

I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.

Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.

You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.

No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.

A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.

Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --

I'm sorry...

And charming?

Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.

I'm afraid it's not very frightening.  They have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as I understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people.

Why did you come in here?

She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.

And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.

You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?

What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --

I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.

How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.

No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.

The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.

I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.

I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.

Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.

Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?

Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?

So maybe you'll come too?

You want to go?

Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.

So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?

Elena, what are you're talking about?

Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --

Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?

Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?

Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.

I know, I know. I had no idea --

Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you.

Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should...

Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.

Ben--

Birth control.

I just can't believe you could be so --

What do you think we're doing, dad?

C'mon.

Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.

Thanks for the advice Dave.

Don't fret, Benjie, it's --

I suppose we'll make an appearance.

You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.

Nah, that wasn't in the contract.

I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.

Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.

Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.

It's not a bother.

Educated guess.

Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--

Yes, it was -- I ended up --

I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --

Forget how to ride a bike.

All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?

That's right.

I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.

But not too ashamed.

I gotta get to English class.

Do what?

Aha! I could sense the vibe.

Hey, it's a sellable skill.

That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.

They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?

Who said so?

Sure.  Twinkie?

What time is it?

What are you doing at home on a Friday night?

Hey Sandy.

Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.

The ones you built?

I have to go to the bathroom.

Are you his girlfriend?

One more shot?

Huh?

Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.

Too bad...

Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!

But they're so boring.  All small stuff.

But there wasn't any...

The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.

Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.

It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.

Worth pursuing?

Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.

I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.

I told her to come.

Seven years.

I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force."  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night.

Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...

You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...

We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.

Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?

After that she left the party to go to him.

You're not missing much.

You're going to be brought in for questioning.

He.  Well, he...

Told you I could write an ending.

This an accident, Walter?

They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.

You fell too much. So much you make me feel...

If you say so. You are innocent.

Yes... My God...

No.

What you are? You would be something other than you are?

I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.

Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.

Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.

Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.

Sit still. It's not finished -

Tell me why...you've got to tell me...

And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.

He'll never let us go.

The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.

Don't mock, Claudia...

And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.

Not yet.

Yes...

You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --

Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.

Be still!

Yes...

But if she dies...

What do you mean?

They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...

Dying?

You have fed. You were made for this...

It can't be...

Do you think so?

I don't pretend to know.

I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!

Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.

Lestat, what do you mean?

I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!

That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -

Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?

I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.

He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.

It's over, I'm telling you...

Au contraire, monsieur, I have.

My daughter...

Yes!

Checking in...Karla Wilson.

And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.

What about a radio?

What the hell would you call this?

Who? Who is here?

That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.

Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.

No.

Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...

No, I'm the King of the World.

Karla! You promised.

Yes.

The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.

We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.

I've got to see.

No, you're not.

Why are you being like this?

What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.

This weekend?

Will you try...for me, please?

Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.

You know me to well.

Who?

I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.

It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.

To get out of Southport?

What?

It beets being on the mainland.

Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.

It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...

It's in my room!

Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.

Did you get help?

Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!

Rio, baby!

Why?

We gotta get out of here. Now.

Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...

No. I shot him.

Must have missed the sign.

So why are you still here?

She's in her room.

Good winds and bad winds!

Very well. I'll wager a dinner.

My friend -- what can one say --

We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.

No.  She shall not be left here.

I think not.

Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.

In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then - I'll not die  I'll watch - they shall not hurt you.

They shall not hurt you

Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.

That should decide it or you --

It was, the plague

That your father and I 

If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.

Her name is Thea?

Her family name?

Miss Wollsten - my secretary, she'd know.

This girl -- Thea - is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.

Maybe you've got the wrong crypt  after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.

You are my friend.

Come - you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.

Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.

The General threatened me.

Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --

For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --

So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.

How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?

Who?

All right  all right.

I'm hurrying.

Bert! Thank heaven you're here!

Carter  bank examiner.

Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.

Yeah, very funny.

Well, who are you, then?

I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?

Our clothes are dry.

No, of course not.

Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.

Well, naturally. Of course.

If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.

That's the kid.

Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.

Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.

That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.

Of course it's the place.

Give the flower a drink.

I know  I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.

Hee-haw!

Oh . . .

Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.

Kind that will help you find the answers, George.

Hmmm?

Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.

Yes, sir.

No, sir.

No.

Yes  charge.

Oh, George.

No. No.

He's pretty young for that job.

Oh, wait. Wait . . . Wait a minute.

Hello, Vi.

Nothing.

Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?

Yeah  yeah . . . sure I will.

Right down here.

Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.

And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .

Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .

I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.

You like it? I'll send you a box.

I'll take chocolate.

I don't like coconuts.

Neither am I.

Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.

You may kiss my hand.

Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?

I'm going to scream!

Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?

Have you made up your mind?

Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.

Would you rather leave?

Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.

George, darling! Where have you been?

Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!

What plates?

Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?

Oh, shucks . . .

With the right wind, 15-20 knots.

You going to the lighthouse?

What the hell.  For you....

How fast is enough?

I could give you a dozen good reasons.

We better go back in.

That's awful.

There's a shark....

Gangway, Turkies!

Can you get us a line?

No!  It's still there!

Aren't you off-duty?

Happy to do it.

Hendricks.  I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.

You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.

Right.

Got it.

You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.

You'll have to make up your own mind about that.

Okay, okay.

Not till next year.

Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.

Did you get any pictures?

Me neither.

Come on, let's check the bite radius.

I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....

Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.

So there's one around here.

Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....

And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.

Home it is.

What're you guys doing today?

Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?

Damn.

Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?

Oh.  Want to talk about it?

Terrific.

Are you going to be able to sleep?

Ooohh, nothing.  I just got fired, that's all.

What'd I say?

Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.

Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....

I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....

Two of them are still missing!

Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.

That's what he said.

What's daddy doing?

Great.

Waiting for Andy.

You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.

Just like this.

And second?

Mike?  Our Mike?

What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  Which way are we going?

Power line.

I'm not sure I can.

I love it.

Might as well.

When are we going out?  You and me?

Yeah.

Quiet!  Shhh!

I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?

He thought he had a good reason.

Forget it, he won't listen.

No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.

No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.

Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.

It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.

No.

How many sharks have you killed?

What is it, 97 days?

See you later.

No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.

Get out of here!

Just put your mask on.

Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you.

God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?

I know I can capture it.

What's that?

No.

How's your patient?

Me, too.

You don't.

Sure.  Let's go.

Well, that's why you got it.

Hydrophobia...

I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!

It's a shark's tooth!

That's just it, Michael.  We don't!

You two go!  I'll call Calvin!

... Okay.

Yes, aren't we all.

Make this quick!

I thought they were clever.

No, no.  That won't do.

Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.

I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.

Because I don't trust you, that's why.

So do I.  But for different reasons.

We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.

Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?

How'd it get in here?!

He's missing.

Sure.  No problem.

I don't know, it depends.

Well, wait till you see the rest.

I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?

What, hon?

Hold still, damn it!

Now what?

Don't you dare.

What?

Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?

Precisely.

Oh...

No way.

Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.

It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.

Nowhere....

Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....

We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?

No....

What's wrong?  What happened?

It went away....

I don't know....

I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.

It's beginning....

I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....

We'll be there....

You have something to say about everything....

I'm hungry, Mom....

Adds flavor....

Who's coming?

I'll miss you....

I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....

Good.  So will I....

Good.

I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....

I'm fine....

I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....

I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.

Why'd you come out here?

Promise me....

First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.

Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?

I always listen to my feelings....

Doesn't matter....

Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....

Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....

A big one....

What?

There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....

The whole idea is preposterous....

Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....

I do....

You're the man who drives the plane.

Yes I can....

We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....

You sure you know how to do this.

Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....

Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?

Still chasing fish?

She's a tough lady....

She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....

I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....

Stop busting my hump....

I made them, man....

Put me down....

Where the hell's the beer...?

As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....

We got it together, Jake....

So did I....

What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?

As long as he's been here....

You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.

I am...You must know something about him....

Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....

I'm going down, Jake....

You don't like my voice...?

Screw you, Jake....

I've got to get to her....

It'll work....

The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....

No way....

I'm the one who wanted to study it....

Oh, Jake... 

I'm training to....

When he has a pillow over his head....

Yes.

What?

Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...

I hope I'm not intruding?

You heard. Look for the knife.

I think you're here all day.

The <u>dogs</u>?

A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..

O.K.

Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.

O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.

Listen to me saying what?

No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.

I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?

You don't really believe this?

No .. You didn't know that ..

Screw Citrine. He can fire me.

Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?

I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..

I'm going up to the institute.

Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.

No, Sir.

Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.

I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..

What are you looking for?

<u>You</u> put it in there.

He ain't offerin me shit.

As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?

No.

.. sorry your father, mother sis- ter, whatever .. I couldn't take another day of it .. Come on, I'm gonna rob you of a cup of coffee ..

How d'you know what I'm like?

Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..

I'm going back to the institute.

Why does he want to kill me?

I'm blind because my father drank.

I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.

C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..

Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.

Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..

I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.

No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.

No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.

He has? .. What's he doing here?

His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.

Don't annoy me, Travis.

Whatta you mean, "horrible?"

Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.

Jerry, this is what intimacy is!

I know about the bachelor party.

I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.

Could you just stop moving?

There is something missing here.

You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.

"Something in the way.  Yeah."

Just be friendly and say "no comment."

They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.

No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called "my twenties." See you later.

My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.

Absolutely.

I just got goosebumps.

Well, I'm happy for you.

Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.

Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.

Yeah, thanks.

Sure.

Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.

No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.

Happy. He said "happy?"

You don't have to explain.

Oh good.

Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.

What?

Fine, I just --

Well, when you wonder, ask me.

What --

Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?

If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.

Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.

Thank you.

Good.

-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.

It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.

I'll give it everything.

Denver got very silent about a day ago.  San Diego's got a fever for Cush.  This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  People get crazy.  And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight.  Million.

Mmm.  Hmm.

Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.

I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."

Well, boo-fucking-hoo.

That's your word?

But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.

Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --

Fine.

You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.

No, I don't know.

Shame on you.  SHAME on you.

No.

What's that supposed to mean?

Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"

Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.

Go.  Flee.

--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...

A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.

Don't be silly.

"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...

Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.

I know.  It sucks.  I suck.

I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.

A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.

I'm scared.  What is it?

And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.

We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.

We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.

What?

What's a bad idea?

Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.

Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...

Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.

Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.

I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...

How low?

He's not a kill, he's still alive.

I thought you were an expert.

Sure.

We'll be broke in four weeks.

No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!

It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.

Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.

I don't remember that on InGen's list.

We should take it with us to signal any planes.

It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.

Goodbye, Alan.

Any weapons, radios?

Yeah.

A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.

Are you sure?

Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.

Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...

Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.

It doesn't matter what I think.

When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.

Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?

Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.

After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.

I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.

That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.

I don't even know this woman.

Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.

You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.

Operations building.  Far end of the street.

It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--

She's nuts.

Oh, my God.

Our chance to do what?

No!  Get in the car before they hear us!

No.

DAMN IT, BE SURE!!

Look!  Sarah!

Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.

Why did you come here?

So the truth is more important to you than your life?

It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-

That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.

Funded by whom?

What?!

Birdshit?

I believe in him.

That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.

I'm trying!

No.

JUMP!

Stop the program!  Stop the program!

Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.

So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.

What now?

Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.

The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.

Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?

Oh my God.

A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 

But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.

They died together?

Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?

They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.

Small versions of adults, honey.

What kind of park is it?

The - - agility.  You're right!

Say again?

Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!

And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.

Alan!

The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.

I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!

When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -

It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -

- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -

Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?

That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 

He sends his apologies.

Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.

Tim, are you okay?

No.

I doubt it.

Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -

It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?

Nope.

Why?

Machines hate you?

Kids get scared.

You're sure?!

- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -

The brachiosaur?  Thirty.

We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.

Who?

Please!

Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!

John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.

I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.

I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.

There's no sign of him anywhere.

They don't bother me.

We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.

Fuck you.

Who's chest?

It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.

This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns, Comedies, Film Noire, Science Fiction...

One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.

So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?

Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.

Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.

Me too. I'm drunk.

He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.

Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.

Yeah, what is it?

So what do we do?

It was Krueger, wasn't it?

And if he's not?

My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.

Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?

You have been hearing the sordid side then.

You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.

The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.

-- Small.

Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.

Did you?

There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.

What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?

An empty tomb?

Another one?

No, I left it in his office.

I'll commit that to memory.

Yes.

I do.

Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.

Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.

Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.

The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.

They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.

I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.

Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?

Why were you given notice?

Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.

He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.

Usually.

I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.

No -- not this time.

I don't know.

-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.

That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.

A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?

Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.

On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one.

Yes.  Isn't it there?

Orlac is an account?

We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.

Oskar.

You look tired.

They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.

It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.

Amerika for us!

It's ... lovely.

Father ... Father!

You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!

Value? ... Value?

No!

There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.

I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?

Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!

We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!

A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb

Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake

It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?

Look -- could I use your phone?

Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?

Yes -- all right --

Yes.

I said yes, I see.

Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.

I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.

You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.

Mm.

No, I'm look --

I go on rounds.

It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --

You said you wanted these.

I don't see anything, do you?

And I don't think that was Tom.

When?

Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.

I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?

Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?

Why?

You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!

I don't like getting splashed.

Yup.

What am I supposed to say?

Don't touch anything.

My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.

Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.

Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.

I don't think so.

No. I'm sore.

It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.

I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.

How is it back there?

Yeah, two things Pete, that --

Yeah. It wasn't Tom.

Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.

Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.

Someone's been doing all these things.

Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.

Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.

It's not so bad.

No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --

Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?

I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.

I think she's trying that.

Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --

I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.

I looked it up.

Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.

Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.

I see you have people there. What are their names?

Playing.

In real life when does he hit you?

On earth.

The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?

That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.

Oh, for God's sake...Here.

Some of the brown stuff is still there.

You're no bargain either, pal.

That's okay, pal.  Go back to sleep.  It's very late.

Uh huh?

It's okay, son...I'm here... Just a little more to go... Don't worry, son...I'm here...

See you in the morning light...

You like it?

I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.

Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you.

Uh, huh?

Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.

Yeah, there was apple juice.

Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.

Like a principal?

Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?

Overruled.  The witness will answer, please.

Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?

Yes, your honor.

The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.

Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.

How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?

Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question.  Does she have a lover?

Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.

While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred.

Yes.

No.

Do you have a lover now?

Yes.

What about Billy?

I don't know...

You want what?!

Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--

Ted, do you love him?

Ted, do you love him?

Oh, God...Oh, my God...

Beautiful.

Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--

I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.

Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.

He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.

Murray.

Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.

Kramer--

Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.

I'm going to take it.

But it's not a year from now, is it?

I can't tell you how sorry I am.

Ted?  Are you there?

She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.

No, but--

Ted, all I wanted to know was where--

What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.

Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.

Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.

No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.

I told her you're doing a

A moment.

Yes, Holiness.

Again?

I know.

It is alright, Father.

But, I am in charge.

And you have horses? You love horses.

Will you buy the sheep for me?

Can I free the prisoners?

No!

Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.

General Chiang.

Thank you. Please sit.

The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.

I miss my brother.

Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.

I accept it. What is suffering?

I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?

Answer. 

It is an island. American territory.

And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?

The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.

Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.

Good day.

For me, I think such a mix is crucial.

Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"

You decide.

Pretend.

The Chinese.

Ahh.

Ahh.

Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.

And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.

They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.

Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.

It is possible, Holiness.

Too young?

We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.

You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.

Thank you.

<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!

They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.

Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend.

No!!  Out!

And you like me.

What the hell are you doing?!!

You're crawling around like a--

No crocodile has ever--

Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.

He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.

Then do it!!

I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.

Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--

You ready on shore?

'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.

U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.

Are you sure?

I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--

No.

Could we have intercourse?

You're not okay, your leg's a mess.

Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.

Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...

Hank <u>says</u> he's sure.

What?

<u>Something's</u> in that water.

Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.

I'm sorry but you're...

In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.

Excuse me?

But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?

Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.

It's okay.

Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.

Night.

We seem to say goodnight a lot.

You're mushing it a little around the--

You calm down!

Look.

Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?

Let's go.

Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.

Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?

So does he.

Other than to eat us?

I'm fine, thank you.

Yes.

What kind of backup do we have?

Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.

I asked you to be nice to him.

And that's why he thinks they're Godly?

Hector thinks you like him.

<u>That</u> was a bust.

Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?

Wait.

Absolutely.

You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...

I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--

Part of our research--

<u>Kelly</u>--

Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.

It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--

Liar?

Never cock. Just squeeze.

The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...

He's here, Ardelia.

'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.

I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.

Sometimes.

Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.

Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?

Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.

Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.

Good morning, Mr. Crawford.

Yes sir.

It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.

Murdered...? How?

There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?

I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?

Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.

He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?

I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.

Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.

He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it...

Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -

Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.

They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.

Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?

Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.

May I see your credentials?

How many women has he used, our Bill?

And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.

A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.

What's that, Dr. Lecter?

How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.

Why? Do you know something about him?

Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.

I don't know. Is it?

Was it a butterfly?

Killed outright?

Why so briefly?

How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?

And - one morning I just - ran away...

Early. Still dark.

What was it?

Yes...! They were screaming.

I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...

Yes...

Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.

Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.

Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...

Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.

I'm sorry.

Why, I am looking at you, Miss.

I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.

Maybe...

When? How?

There was no letter.

Aversion?  No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"...

Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?

Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.

You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...

We were headed...

No.

This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.

: Only one or two loads.

Tradin' your skins in Castleton?

...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...

By your leave, sir.

Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...

Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.

You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis. 

General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.

Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready! 

Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!

Atten-hut!

Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."

Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.

This interview's over! The militia stays!

When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.

Yes.

That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.

Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--

Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.

No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...

Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around?

Uh, oh...I see where this is going...

There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...

Fuck your orders!

I got hung up!  Try this!

What?

There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...

You screw around like that again and--

Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.

Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.

You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.

Roger.

Ahhhh!

Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.

Beautiful.

Do it.

Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.

I realize you must have gone through hell--

Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...

Itches like hell.

I'm going to kill it!

Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...

Probably the plumbing.  You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?

What are you going to do to him?

I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.

Like a leech.

No fuckin' lie...

Oh man, that's just great...

The good doctor signed our death warrant.

Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?

Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?

Seven hundred for the pair.

Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.

They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?

I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.

Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.

I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.

That inspires confidence, that does.

A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.

Yeah, Bazza, what?

Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?

It looks like ít, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.

No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?

Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?

That's no way to answer the phone.

I got the money to pay for 'em.

All right, Kenny.

This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.

Furry muff, let's go.

There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.

I didn't touch him, he just passed out.

Just give me the keys.

How about you? All right?

You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?

It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.

Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.

He means they're thieving dogs.

Right as rain.

Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.

For half a million?

It's Ed, if that's what you mean.

I want your bar.

I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.

You know it doesn't include the amp.

Doesn't sound very good to me.

I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.

I'll only be a minute.

So?

Get your fingers out of my soup!

Nick the Greek.

Six.

That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.

We need fertilizer, Winston.

I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--

You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.

So?

Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.

They stole our land--

It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.

No, sir. Not at all.

Yes, sir.

He'll live.

We were just dancing--

I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.

Sergeant?

Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--

That badge--

Yeah.

He swore by it.  What?

You little pissant--

Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--

Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?

--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.

You look awful good in that uniform, though.

Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?

The Trail of Tears.

They fought against the Indians?

Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?

No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--

Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--

He does.

I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.

You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--

I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.

You know who it was they dug up?

That ring--

Good deal you were born down here, then.

Substance abuse?

That's where he fell.

If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.

I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.

No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]

This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?

Protection?

Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]

We was crossin' the river--

We have a daughter.

Seems like we have another one every week.

Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--

Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.

You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?

No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?

There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.

Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--

And the ten thousand?

You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"--

The Perdido thing?

Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.

Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.

Steve?

If you spent a little more time training them--

He was killed.

Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?

Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.

I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.

Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.

Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.

Okay? He's not here?

That was the night he disappeared?

He ever accept cash for a favor?

Yeah?

For a while.

It's Saturday.

I only went for my last two years.

Hey, Pete. How's it going?

You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?

So I've heard--

Well, you were working there--

Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--

So she tells me three times a week.

They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.

Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--

You've got your mother, your kids--

You know the other day, you asked why I came back?

More, I hope.

Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.

Pilar--

I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--

The shooter local?

No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.

Just doing my job.

That the problem, son?  You Slow?

I haven't seen anybody come by.

They go together.

Who is he?

You heard right.

doorway) And who's that?

About?

You'll do more.than that.

It's him... it's him.

Why did you wait so long?

And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?

Yes...

He's with us... He's with us...

Yes.

Does that mean...?

No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,

When do you want me to start?

Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.

Swann said he could do stuff, yes.

He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.

Some or it.

No it isn't.  You can't help me.

Nothing?

And they all came...

It's all right.  It's not hurting...

Harry...

I'm okay.  I'm okay.

Harry-?

Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.

Yeah.  Remember Quaid?

I just saw him.

--vanished.

I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...

What about Swann's miracles?

I heard he was the best.

Fuck you.

Mr. D'Amour?

It's one in the afternoon.

I don't think the dead much care.

You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.

A ticket home,

Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.

Yeah, I know.

Shut up!

Yes.

Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.

What's her problem?

And what does Jennifer think's real?

I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...

You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.

And you're not?

Looks that way.

You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.

You didn't try hard enough.

Yes?

No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.

There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.

No.

He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.

I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.

Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...

Philosophy.

Ok.

Do you want to have some breakfast?

I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?

Yeah, you don't remember?

No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.

Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...

But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.

Fuck off.

We should get you to the doctor.

Yeah.

Tomorrow.

Yes.

I'll miss you.

Yes?

It's just carpet.

What are you talking about?

Is there anything I can do?

Fine.

Do you want to- 

Tomorrow.

What?

I gotta go to work.

Bye.

Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to...

Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.

Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?

I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?

Sushi.

No, I wasn't, actually.

Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.

You know I'm not comfortable with this.

I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.

And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?

You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.

You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.

It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.

I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.

Miette, come here and relax.

...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...

You just call?

I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.

You're right.  I must've made a mistake.

I had to.

At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.

So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.

Townsend, he had some of Father's books.

That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.

Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.

What are these?

What did he say to you in French?

Not a lot.

It's me.  Put the gun down.  Maya...

Look, John, I'm facing it.

You are the younger of two...

Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?

I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.

It's Detective Smythe.

Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.

No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.

Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.

I'll quit, maybe you should start.

I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.

Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?

I can't eat before a game.

Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.

How is he?

His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.

So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?

She's alright.

The blue.

Thanks, sweetheart.

Really?  Well, come on, then.

You love to pose so much, let's see it again.

Uh-huh.

Shh.  It's okay.

It's okay.

What?

Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.

Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...

Found?  I'm not some charity case.

Oh, great.

That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.

Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?

Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.

But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.

I wouldn't know.

Lucky.

My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.

I don't care.

For how long?

I know this.  What do you want?

Guess "please" would be a stretch.

Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.

I'm warning you, don't tempt me.

Yeah.

I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.

Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.

Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.

Quit.

I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.

What?

My court, I go first.

She understands.

You're not stupid.

Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.

What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?

I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.

I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?

I'm alright.  But you can sit.

A rest?

Then why are you so upset?

C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?

What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."

Business folks.

Happy.  And he won't want to see you.

What are you doing in my room?

Yup.

Sorry.  You okay?

This is just about money, you know that.

Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.

I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.

I don't wanna hurt your feelings.

We need to talk.

Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.

Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.

In my sleep, Burt.

What's wrong?

I'm really only equipped to take orders --

I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --

Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --

baby, please, please --

-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?

Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.

I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?

Was it a boyfriend of yours?

You just move in here?

I'm a bit of a slob myself.

You and your boyfriend have a party last night?

-- do you wanna cup?

Okey-doke.

If you're not here for a 422 --

Bye.

ok.

I've got troubles.

What?

You mind if I come in, check things?

yeah, yes, hi, hello.

It doesn't matter.

How much time do we have?

I don't know.

Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.

No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...

-- no.

Put the gun down, please, boy.

We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --

No Can Do.

Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.

What's up?

Stay that way.

You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.

Gently, son --

PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!

Phil's one of the nurses from the service?

She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.

I've seen it before.

There's no asshole like you.

How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"

I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --

Who are you gonna call?

It's ok.

No.

What?  Say it again...walking in the car?

Alright.  Thank you.

Are we gonna tape some stuff now?

Is that still lingering?

So boring, so useless --

Yes.

-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --

I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.

I'm quietly judging you.

So you sat it out, that's what you did?

Well I guess it doesn't.

He passed away.

people die.

From '84 to '89.

What name?  My name?

"Frank" was my mother's father.

Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --

I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --

Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.

You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?

I went out last night.

THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!

Fuck no.

I need you to get me Paula --

Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --

Yeah.

I'll answer anything.

No one else that I know?

How long with Ellen?

How long with Paula?

Well maybe.

Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?

Maybe...I don't...

I think that she thinks I may have molested her.

You're her boyfriend?

Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --

Not as much as I used to.  Ever since we started, I haven't really gone in to school that much because I've been getting more and more auditions --

No.  But I probably will get a call back.

Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --

Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --

...I don't....

-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --

I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.

Cigarettes. Camel Lights.

That's it.

Thank you.

That's pretty cool.

-- the fuck are you talking about?

I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school.

Love you too.

I can take you to get money.  I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.

It's raining frogs from the sky.

And you were not hurt?

I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.

We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.

I wish to discuss your brother.

Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?

Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both.  He has already picked the Pope.  Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way.

Making the key to the throne.

Soon enough.  Here we are.

Come, we have a boat waiting.

Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.

Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --

In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --

You grow fond of him.  That's good.

But -- what is Porthos doing?

But -- what is he doing?

The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?

Hold your goblet with two fingers.

You're a fool!

So what has changed?

Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.

We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.

I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.

Everyone back.

There are more important things than tits.

Forgiveness?

Catacombs.  Very holy.

Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.

Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.

Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.

Why didn't you say so?

Who does?

It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out!

Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.

We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.

She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.

Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.

It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.

Raoul --

Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?

I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.

I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.

I know.

Get out of my way.

The King killed my son!

No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.

I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.

I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.

It is something I have done -- or did not do.

Whose rooms are those?

How did you --

If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.

Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --

Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!

You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.

No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son.

... Two-thirty-seven.

What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!

It's lovely.  It's just...

I... we are humble people...

Oh Louis, Louis...

Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --

Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?

Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.

Alright, stay on the phone.

It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!

Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--

He must have got the keys... off Stanton.

But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?

These crowds are going to make it a bitch!

Did you start out area six?

Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.

She stole my car!!

That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.

I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!

They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.

Yeah?

Seattle.

No.

What happened with the tape?

So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.

Please...

Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?

I knew I could count on you.

How about Marvosa and the others?

I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess.

Hop in.

Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.

Screw him!

Not with this...

Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?

Then what did you do, play canasta?

Why aren't you ever alone with him?

Could he handle a direct contact?

He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.

How are Molly and the boy?

That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.

Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...

Read it.

Because it's his bad luck to be special.

I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.

No.

What do you want to do?

Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.

What's one way?

We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?

Why?

I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.

No.

What's it narrow down to?

That's narrow?

VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?

There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.

Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...

He had to.

What?

How far away's the back-up?

Let's get to the physical.

Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.

The activities of nocturnal animals.

It'll do fine.

They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.

You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...

Uh-huh.

It's a surprise.

No.

Shut up. Stop. Stop it.

No. I don't want to see you.

Yes.

Dr. Chilton.

Uh... sure...

Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....

How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?

No. I can help you.

Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.

Goodbye.

Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?

Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?

Hey, baby! Where are you?

I have to see somebody.

Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...

I remember.

Yes. I said this is too good to live...

It's what Kevin called her when he was little...

You got a deal...

Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?

Are you George Sherman?

No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.

No.

I got it. Thank you.

You've read the transcript. It's all there.

Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.

Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?

I want your opinion.

When you do have one I'd like to hear it.

Do you know how you caught me, Will?

It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.

And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!

I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.

Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.

What's up?

Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"

But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.

Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.

Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.

Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.

Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!

Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.

Deal.

These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...

I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.

No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!

Don't worry!  The kids will love it --

I said I didn't want to do the sketch.

You're a wimp.

Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!

No!  Andy, don't do it --

Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!

It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.

Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...

Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.

The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.

Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.

I'll take my chances!!

He said he's coming back!

They're gonna lynch him!

Why isn't he MOVING??

"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?

Know what?

Two grand.

Hear what?

Morpheus will take him when he's ready.

Cypher?  Where's Tank?

My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.

The Matrix?  Yeah.

Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?

Any time.

Go.

Yes.

I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.

How do you know all this?

What does that mean?

A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?

For what?

Your mind makes it real.

Yeah.

No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.

What's going on?

She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.

Why?

Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.

I need the main wet-wall.

Shit, I'm sorry.

How did you know...?

Who?

What?

Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.

What do you mean, without him?

Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.

From you.

Easy, Neo.  Easy.

Are you worried?

Yeah?

No.

Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.

Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?

Because I believe in something.

Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!

Duck!

Kick it in!  Kick it in!

I'll be all right.

I can't!

Look fella...this is private...

Let go of her.

Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.

Well the guy over there said...

Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?

Uh...can we give you a check?

Anybody wanna have a game?

No.

Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.

The number was 235 - I bet it combination.

I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...

C'mon Tony, waddaya say?

Didn't show up.

What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?

Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.

That's not going to help.

It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?

Don't be smart.

No you're not...

No, I just want to help myself, that's all.

No.

I don't understand, where's Groppi?

I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...

$20.

Fine.

That's nice.

Hostess?

Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?

Wha?

Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.

Here.

You're intolerable today.

Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?

I know...I know.

Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.

Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!

But...

For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?

Count it.

Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.

You what?

Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.

Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.

Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.

And you could care less --

Annie made them.

It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?

But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"

No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.

How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?

Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.

What side of the industry did you say you were on?

Why yes, thank you.

What an odd pairing.

Then why did you bring it up?

'Yes' to the deal?

Did you just hear something?

No no, not you.

Do you think I need a haircut?

What do you mean?

Uh -- he's from out of town --

Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.

Bontecou wants a quick response and --

So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?

No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.

Joe, you do get around.

-- But he was concerned about the timing?

'It's up to Joe'?

No, no.  I on holiday.

Make it go 'way.

Make it time.

Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?

Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.

Are you?

And you're a nice man, Quince.

'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?

What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?

Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.

No.

You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.

I haven't.

Watch me do what?

Gay?

To bed.

Yes.  I'm tired.

It was everything.

How beautiful.

Nowhere?  I'm...here.

Oh, I hope a long, long time.

We know all that we need to know --

Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.

Good morning, Bill.

It is a deal?

You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.

That's what everybody says.

That's what everybody says.

I don't understand.

Of course.

I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?

Are you going to fire me, Bill?

I'm sorry to hear that.

Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --

What are you saying, that it's time to go?

Not at all.

With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?

I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.

An indictable offense.

What the hell is this?  Who are you?

Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --

The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.

You're only six-five once.

Probably.

You're not listening --

'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --

He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.

We've met.

Will it?...

Raise away.

It's something.

Joe?

Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?

What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard, whether you like or not.

Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.

What's the way?

Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?

You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?

But we've got time.

I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.

Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.

It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.

No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably...

Then why is this my handwriting?

Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.

Yeah?

* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *

Don't be too hard on yourself.

Interested in buying one?

I don't want blood on them.

Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?

I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.

Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.

No!

I have this condition -

Don't protect him.

Kill him. I'll pay you.

That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!

Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!

Sweet.

Well, that's me.

Who's your boyfriend?

Are you Teddy?

You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?

We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.

Then why are you here?

I enjoy it.

That's who you were, you don't know who you are.

I don't remember.

The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?

Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.

Fucking hope not.

Shut it, Teddy.

Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.

I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.

Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?

Why not?  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99

The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.

I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.

There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!

Yes, I will.

No. You took them out.						  *

Quit it!							 * 					   * You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why			 * you're so good at it.						   *

You can't just take it!

Doing...?

Grieve elsewhere.

It's a rip and a hit.

You said Nazi Low-riders...?

...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...

Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.

Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...

No.

Do I need it?

When?

He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.

Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...

Something's wrong.

Who knows...

On my way back...

Verdado.

No.

And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?

And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.

As in...?

This is Agent James Fujima.

From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.

Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.

How will it stand up?

...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!

But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.

He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...

Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...

Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.

Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?

But what does your intuition tell you...?

What would you do...?

Meaning...?

Do we need this...?

Alonzo...

They lied.

Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.

My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...

I mean, dammit, where you live?

Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?

I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.

Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.

And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.

Can he smell the difference, eh?

Don't say nothing about you either.

Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.

What of?

Who?

I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.

I'm wet.

What?

Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.

I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.

No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.

Ready for anything.

No. You got it.

Where?

The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.

There's two ways out I figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. The other way is Under.

And what do you do when you in the catacombs?

Everything.

Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.

I'll pay extra

Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?

I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.

Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.

I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.

Where is it?

Cut his fucking throat.

I want to cut his throat.

Maybe he's changing jobs.

My passport!

That's a great philosophy.

Mr. Yesil.

It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.

Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!

Shit.

H-how do I get...?

I think so. One right, two lefts...

Just do it!

Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...

Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?

Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.

I pull.

Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!

Across both tracks!!

No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!

"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."

I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.

Okay. So you lost a great specimen-

Maybe they lied to you.

How?!

Try not to sweat?

We can do it!

No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.

I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...

What?

Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?

I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.

Following me?

I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.

It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 

Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.

I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.

I guess that means it's okay.

Misery?

I know how that can be.

I'm...

Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--

Perfect.

No big deal.

You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.

Great.

If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.

That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.

You just expect me to whip something off, that it?

You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.

I want my pills NOW!

The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.

It is.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?

Be my guest.

But the time is now. Soon others will come.

You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.

Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.

Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.

It's good you found it.

Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?

I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.

So do I...

We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.

You're still a writer.

I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.

Did they win?

Well that depends.

How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?

Ahh..

In other words, you're calling her a flake.

It's that time.  Go.

More like two-two point two million.

A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?

We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..

He's heading down the stairs, now..

Far right.

Do what?

Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.

Five, six-hundred thousand.

I don't.

Affirmative.

Oh Ethan!..

I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.

No.  You just looked as if you did.

In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.

Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.

We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.

Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.

Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?

Well, Hunt, what are your plans?

Yep.

Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.  There's an enveloped inside --

You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..

All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.

She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.

By asking me.

You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.

You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.

Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.

S.O.P..

Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!

What about him...?

Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..

All ten million.

Roger that.

No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.

What happened to Jim?

What happened to Jim?

Take off your God damn coat!

I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.

Who is "they?"

We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.

What about you?

Bastard!

He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.

You are my eyes.  Stay with him.

Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me.

One hour.

The arms dealer.

How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.

Information.

Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.

Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?

Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?

Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.

I wouldn't dream of it.

Bank?

My contact is extremely shy.

What's the matter, you don't know this trick?

I didn't touch it.

Give me a break, Pops.

Jim we canít.

Why?

A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.

Can you lose him?

About two hundred yards from the bridge.

You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.

I remember..

Youíre probably right.

And get a doctor.

Keep counting Claire.

Loud and clear.

I think I might just take that look.

Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.

I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.

We will both have the Salad Ticino.

No. You were there.

I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.

Maybe.

They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess.

I like your dress.  It's very bright.

You have too many dogs.

I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.

Yes. Do you want...

Bus hit him.

Yesterday.

Seven years ago.

No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.

What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?

I am looking where I should to become a bride!

What?

Take it easy.

You're trying to make me feel guilty.

I can't do that!

Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.

I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.

Hi.

I thought I'd try it.  You look good.

I think that's it.

How can you ask me that?

You are guilty. I'm guilty.

Why?

I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.

No.

No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?

Loretta, what are you talking about?

Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?

No?

Maybe you're right.

She was too young for him.

I don't understand.

A month from today?

Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.

I must ask for that back.

In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.

I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.

Where you been?

Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.

Everything's different.

Oh.

You gotta date?

Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?

Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.

Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say.

If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.

Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.

She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.

I don't know.

It was a miracle!

I'm not disturbed. By you.

Will you join me for dinner?

I think it's because they fear death.

Yes.

No.

Good night.

I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?

Is who down there?

You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.

Oh. Right.

I knew she had it.

Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.

So how can we tell if she is made of wood?

Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?

NI!   NI!

We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.

You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!

One that looks nice.

Now - go!

We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!

I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!

No, no ... not "is"!

Come on then.

Course I have.

Come, Patsy.

This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.

I am Arthur, King of the Britons.

Bedevere, my Liege.

That's it.  Ni!  Ni!

I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.

Quite.

Well ... I AM king.

And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?

Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of

I'm not dead!

You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?

What is your quest?

That's all right.  See you on Thursday.

Thank you, sir, most kind ...

I think I could pull through, sir.

Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...

Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.

You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!

Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?

What - the curtains?

But, Father, I don't really want any of that.

But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...

Listen, Alice ...

Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...

Well ... I'll tell you ...

Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.

Leaving the room.

Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.

No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...

The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!

What is your name, handsome knight?

They're doctors?

Please ... we are doctors.

Back to your bed!  At once!

He's come to rescue me, father.

That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!

So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.

You know what I mean.

You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.

But I'm the only one she trusts.

They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?

I can't let her down now, Archie.

It's a diary.

I can't move to tidy.

I hope to go up next year.

Kitchen and lower house.

Yeah.

Whom you address.

Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.

Who'll bring it to me?

Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!

There are important papers from --

In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.

To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.

Quite.

I don't think about it.

Why do you think I keep her here?

The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.

See what?

Yes, ma'am.

Yes, ma'am.

It's a fine spot, ma'am.

Yes?

For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!

Then why send me back to them?!

Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.

The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?

I hope he got his mother's permission.

Excellent!

Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.

I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....

Why?

We were expecting you to return by six.

Your Majesty --

Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...

Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.

There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...

What the hell does that mean?

We are talking...

Funny.

Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.

Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.

It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.

She thought Benz was at school.

It doesn't necessarily mean she's...

What?

Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...

I don't know.

What?

And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!

I already have a boyfriend, Nick.

We're actually inside, aren't we?

What?!  There's nothing here!

Screamer.

One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?

You have no time.  What is your question?

I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...

Not yet, honey...

That's impossible.

It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.

The game will guide you.

Who fired everyone?

You're broke!

There is no problem.

Yeah.

Whatever.

Sure.

You're an understandin' fella.

Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.

Well, I ...

You got it! See you later honey.

I was afraid of that.

Right. See ya.

I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.

Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.

Very pleased to meet you.

Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?

Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?

I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.

Before what?

But it said #12.

Oh...

You don't remember anything else?

Unh, unh.

Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.

"I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."

"I can call them... I can call my dad... "

"Then they'd put you in jail."

C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.

It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.

Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?

Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.

No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.

Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.

Go ahead.

No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.

Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.

Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.

A brunette? ... maybe beat up?

Yeah, I'd say that's it.

I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....

Why should I ?

We wait. This is an elevator.

We have to climb up that.

You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.

What ?

I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.

Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.

What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?

Okay.

Fine...

Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?

I told him not to sit down in there.....

Because of my charming personality ?

Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations. We're heading a little higher up now.

That's cute asshole.

In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.

Don't have to tell me twice.

Yes, sir Mom. 

Got it.

You've got it boss. One more mangled body to the East River, coming up !

Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.

And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?

That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.

He probably has a history of this shit.

Checking........

Fire the whole division.

Son, let's watch the tape.

Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.

What do you mean sir ?

What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?

Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?

What did you hear ?

No I am not.

You're paying the bills.

I think I'll see hat action.

How can this happen ?

Thank you.

Yes.

If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?

Yahoo !!!!!

Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.

Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.

I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.

Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.

I would do it again in a minute.

What about giving the other guy a break.

His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?

Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.

Okay thanks, atta girl.

She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.

Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.

Seriously?

Hi Dad.

Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.

Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.

If I eat it I'll throw up.

Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.

You're being narrow-minded.

Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...

Oh.  Ohhh?

Ummmmm, look, I...I...

Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.

Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.

More than anything in the world.

Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?

It's just a corpse.

Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.

Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.

Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.

Hi.

The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.

My mother.

I won't.

TAXI!!!

And you're gonna solve the mystery?

May I use the phone please.

He is one of the great poets.

And I thought I was weird.

Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.

Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.

ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.

Oh no?!?!?!

What do you think?

I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...

Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.

I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.

Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.

That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?

Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.

How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....

Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.

This is it I guess.

Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.

Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.

I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?

No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.

You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?

All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.

Not exactly.

I was commenting on your hair.

Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.

Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.

All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.

Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.

Oh, sure okay.

Is there milk in them already?

You're telling me.

No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.

What do you mean?

Hey! Oh look.

O.K.

Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.

Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.

No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.

How do I know you were gonna show us one?

Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.

I'm sure she will.

I haven't been to the movies in AGES.

What's that?

In ages, I know, me neither.

Want to what?

Really?

Okay.

You can get the general idea...

Perfect.

O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.

Vada, just put 'em on the stool.

Then who's it for?

Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.

Ahh, maybe next summer.

Sorry.

Soon honey, soon.

In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.

Yes.

Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.

Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!

Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?

I wrote a poem too.

Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.

Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.

Yes it is.

Oh.

It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.

Uh huh.

No, I'm divorced.

You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.

A girl's always gotta look her best.

Hi.

Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.

I will I promise.

I'm allergic to it.

Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.

It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.

I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?

It'll bleed.

A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.

Hey, where does it say that?

I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.

It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.

I stopped that!

We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.

Bye Mrs. Sennett.

I wanna live with them too.

I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.

I don't like her.

Then go home, baby.

Hi Vada, can you come out?

Not true.

But, I don't know how.

Well, then, I'll take it up with her.

I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.

... weeks.

The wandering sportswriter.

No, he's ruining yours.

I can see why.

You've been working on this, huh?

Someday she'll thank you.

I can't even say it.

What do you suggest?

Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.

You need a few dollars.

... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.

... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...

A trademark move, don't touch it.

Ju...

... whatever is manly and independent.

They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?

I love him.

WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?

I think you're making a mistake, sir.

Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?

It doesn't say th...

He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.

I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?

Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...

You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!

Actually, it all starts tomorrow. It's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from Madagascar such.

Endearingly absent-minded.

She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.

Firenze.

Till the gas ran out.

What, leaving school...

I got the point.

If you like.

Have you.

It's more than that.

You've been the man in mine.

I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.

We danced to it.  Just like this.

Well.

It means a lot.

... maybe it's congratulations.

Well, it happens.

Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.

Shhh.

I came here, looking for her.

This is where I proposed.

That is so romantic.

That's little egotistical.

If you find her...

To him.

Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!

MICHAEL!!

This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef.  With no notice- able competition, present company excepted...

An so it is.

Grand Old Opera --

I see.

Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.

You get her those Vitamin E right away.

Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.

Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?

Well, I just thought I'd call.

Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.

Third party?

You know better than that.

Yes. She's pretty rested up.

Hi. Come on in. Mary!

D.C.

Sure thing.

When is it?

The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.

She's in Paris.

Your brother?

How in the world did he get shot?

Your wire Ester - she passed away.

A little. What do you need?

I'1l get your bag.

Maybe you can look after me a little.

Replacement party.

I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.

I've been so worried, dear. where are you?

Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.

Bye.

When I was little, in church.

About three years.

No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.

He's a member of our congregation.

I can't.

I'm not sure.

Oh.

Older.

Oh.

What...?  0h, yes.

You sound different. Is that really you?

Eight-thirty in the chapel.

Hundreds of times.

He's pretty well known down here.

Out.

Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?

Do you study at all?

Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?

You do?

You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?

I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.

I see.

Yes you are.

The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.

Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.

Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style.

That's what Tim said.

Yes, they were.

Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.

We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --

Don't stop!

We still got a few tricks up our sleeves.

Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.

The prison board and the doctors who examined them.

Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.

Lobotomy Bay?

By all means.

Okay, Wayne, step forward.

Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.

How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?

Have you talked to Mallory about this?

All right, Mickey.

Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?

Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?

You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?

It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.

Okay, let's cut it.

Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.

No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!

No fuckin' way!

You made every day like kindergarten.

And a snake-eye glare.

He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.

Yes.

That's the way of the world.

Survival of the fittest.

They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'

Where do the air ducts lead?

I'll say enough to destroy this wing.

This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.

Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.

They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?

Okay.

Perfecto!

Why?

But you'll never be whole again.

That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.

Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.

Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.

Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.

Wayne, if it was anybody else---

Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?

Everybody givin' it away free, huh?

All right, you get out of here, man!

That's right.

I don't know what you're talkin' about.

No. You got the wrong idea.

Don't start no trouble, boy!

What did you say your name is?

Where's Wilma?

'That right? I thought he was up North.

Thanks.

I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.

No. Just me.  Me an' her.

Oh yeah? That's good.

Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?

Yeah. On the section gang.

You work around town?

No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?

You don't think much of yourself, do you?

You keep asking me why I'm here.

What is it?

Well, I don't get on so well most places.

Don't Duff--

It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.

I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.

Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.

What d'you mean?

Are you married?

Yeah, it's just a coincidence.

What?

How about it?

Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?

Well, what d'you think?

He could live with us.

Yeah, that's so.

Uh-huh. Why?

Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!

I don't want to hurt you.

You jivin' me?

What about your boy?

Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?

Yeah!

Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.

Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.

There's nothing to say.

Why don't you relax, Frankie?

Like what?

Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.

That's right.

Yeah, sure. Good luck.

That's right.

No, they won't.

Okay.

Hell, I'm just like him.

How are you?

How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?

I guess I ain't.

I guess I'll rob a bank.

It's for your own good.

Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?

What's the matter?! You mad at me?

Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.

Anything you say, baby.

Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?

Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...

I'm still on my honeymoon.

I'm fine.

She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.

Of course...

Why not?

I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.

You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.

My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.

First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.

Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.

The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.

This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.

Are you even really alive?

Yeah. That was me.

As far as they know, that's absolutely true.

Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?

I an' I, man. I an' I.

The girl 3Jane. We need her.

Can you walk?

How are we doing?

How long, Dixie?

Less than thirty minutes.

I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.

Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.

I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.

Why would you want me to kill you?

Why should I want to meet him.

For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.

You're not ready yet. They said two days.

Too late?

Won't that mean you're dead?

Okay fine. Let's get this over with.

I don't sleep much. You packed?

Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.

What?

What are you talking about?

I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.

College?

Yes, it's lame.

Right. 7:30.

Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.

Nope.

No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!

Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.

That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?

It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.

Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.

But I don't want it straightened out.

And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!

Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!

Have you been there?

There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.

You already pitched this to Rigfort?!

I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.

You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.

Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?

Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.

Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.

No it's not. Guys name their penises.

Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!

You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!

Don't you remember what they called you?

I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.

No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.

Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?

Is that true?

With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.

And a gymnast!

wasn't even thinking about-

I-

Sorry. Forgetful.

College. Haven't really thought about it.

Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.

That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.

I don't have to say that.

Why do you do that?

That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--

I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.

Nah uh.

Who are you guys?

Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!

And heavy...

I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.

Good.  I'm hungry.

Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?

No.

<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>

Maybe he doesn't know...

What are you talking about?

Ken!

Where's Jesse?

Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!

He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.

She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.

You got a problem with me, Grady?

My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.

Only the wet ones.

Shut up, Grady.

Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...

Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.

It's happening again.

Look at this car.  Are you kidding?

That's okay, I wanted to.

Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.

I know.

Traumas of a ten-year old.

What do you mean?

About what?

Whoa!

I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.

My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.

What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.

'Morning, honey.

Huh?

Okay, I guess.

No.  I'm okay.

Thanks, Mom.

I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.

It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.

Mom?

Wait and see.

I gotta stay up, Max.

Deal.  Thanks.

To old friends.

So?

A little basic, but nice.

Why is that?

She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.

Thanks, Max.

It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?

Thank you.

Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.

That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.

Nancy...

Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.

Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.

With Hypnocyl?

So do I.

Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?

I can do that.

Everybody take five.

This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?

There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.

Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.

And what are they?

How do we get in?

You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.

Don't worry, it won't come to that.

For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.

This is stupid.

In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.

Yeah?  What did we ever do?

I'm delighted.

We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.

I'm not listening.

Well, they can be.

Fifteen million dollars.

Really?

Here, let me help.

No thanks.

You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.

Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.

Thanks.  Well...

Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.

Oh -- Okay.

Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.

Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.

I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.

I thought you were leaving.

Step aside.

No, you were brilliant

There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.

I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.

Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?

Oh no no -- no.

'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.

Well, get a message through to him too.

You think I should do Henry James instead?

No.  What's that?

The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?

You and every person in this country.

Who was Gilda?

Don't ask.

Undressed like this, yes.

I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.

Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.

... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.

That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.

Who is it?

Is that right?

And this is William.

... get fired.

It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.

Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.

Me?

Still, not sparkling.

What's your name?

Yes?

Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.

Is it someone we know?

I believe I have.

And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...

Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?

Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...

Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...

Point taken.

Two?  That's it?

And she's in your house.

Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?

Yes.

What?

What book?

Yes, that's perfectly correct.

I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...

Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...

Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?

I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.

I was in luh-love with her.

You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!

Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...

Will you come with me, please.

Yes, ma'am.

Yes, Mister McMurphy?

That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.

Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.

I wanna report a robbery!

Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!

Go on...

Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?

Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.

I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.

But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.

Thank you, ma'am.

Why, thank you, ma'am...  Whew. Man, I tell you, that place up there is somethin' else!  Well, ya boys been practicin' up for the big game?  I figured as much...

H-H-Hearts.

'K-k-kay, Mack!

W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?

W-W-Where we g-g-going?

Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...

Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?

Thank you.

Ca-na-da...

Wow! They're so quiet.

Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.

Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.

Atta boy, Cheswick!

They went that way.

Does that mean we have to cut him loose?

Me too...

My feet hurt...

What?

Did to you and all the rest of you guys.

I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?

Just warmin' up.

I don't trust you!

No!

Just wait till you hear...

Gary Blinker...

Hit me.

He's not!

In what way?

Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?

Good. Good.

It is worth considering... Miss Ratched?

Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.

Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!

What's the horse pill for, honey?

I'm the next one.

Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!

How much ya wanna bet?

I don't believe it...

Okay. Who else?

Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...

No...

How's your ass been holdin' up, honey?

Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?

P.A. What the hell is that?

On what?

Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!

This way, Mister McMurphy.

Now you talkin'.

Yes, ma'am...

Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...

It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.

Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?

Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.

My friend has lost her fucking mind...

What for?

Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.

You're sure...

Yes.  We did.

My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.

Exactly.

That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.

No.

But, Faith--

Non.  Please.

My name's 

You said whatever it was you would understand.

Yes.

Who says I don't love him?...

Please.  I need to know.

Hi.

You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.

Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.

Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.

No.  I just came by to apologize.

I know the feeling.

A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?

That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?

Beautiful place...

Well, not exactly...

You would?  Really?

Really?

Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...

Yeah.  He's around somewhere.

You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.

Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--

It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.

No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.

He's a podiatrist or something.

No.  He's never asked me.

Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.

Larry brought me flowers last night.

No...  I can just tell.

You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?

Maybe.

The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?

Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.

What is it?

The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.

I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.

'Course he does.

Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?

Is he looking at us?

Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--

I meant about my idea.

Hi.  Where've you been?

So you're just quitting?  Just like that?

I know, but...

I'll be back before you leave.

Yes.  Isn't that amazing?

Is Damon Bradley here?

I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.

Yup.

So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.

Uh huh.

I'd love to.

Right.

You used to love it when I called you doll.

Mania.

He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.

Talk louder. I can't hear you.

When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, "Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say  Talk with your mouth wide open," so if I'm loud don't blame me it's the fault of the nuns!

I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out we take our cut.

So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this a deal I sweated and bled for on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?

Why should he forget it?

I'm not thirsty.

So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.

Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.

I just fnished work. I counted the bags.

I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.

You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.

They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.

Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .

I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.

Okay I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.

Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.

Tommy, what happened?

Give it to me my Pop's job

Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.

The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?

I don't know.

I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested in pigeons.

I am?

How do you like it?

What a fruitcake you are!

Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.

I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not I'm just all mixed up... .

Why should I come hollering to you at all?

I can't let myself fall in love with you.

I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt What more do you want?

I know... I know... .

You?

How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.

Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.

He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .

He wanted to see me again.

You are like

A question of who rides who.

How much is your soul worth if you don't?

Good luck.

A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom with the truth as you know it  Truth is the gun Drop that thing and tell the truth a more dangerous weapon than this little   cap pistol.

Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.

Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!

Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but

What about it?

We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.

What?

You know what you're askin'? You're askin'

I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.

's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.

Yeah, yeah, I was awake anyway so I figured  They got it made. Eat all they want fly around like crazy sleep side by side and raise gobs of squabs.

Take it easy now, Terry.

First things first.

Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 

Forty-five bills.

So-so, Johnny.

Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.

Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should've been told if

Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I

Thanks, Johnny... .

Aw, Johnny... .

You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.

Listen, Johnny

Go on, beat it!

Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.

What are you down here for to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?

Okay.

I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.

It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!

You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.

I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.

Nothing is worth your life.

My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.

Of course I do.

Ahh, there is yet time.

Well then let us proceed.

You mean...!

Is there time?

You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.

I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!

Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!

Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?

Yes, it is.

Tell me, how do you do that?

They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.

I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.

Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met?

His assistant.

Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.

Why you want to do that, to a frien'?

Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.

The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...

Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move.

You're right.

You better come see this.

We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.

She just sat there, looking right at me.

Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.

They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.

Two hours.

Forty-five minutes.

Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.

Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.

Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?

Yeah, I did.

I don't know.

I get that feeling, yeah.

They sure do.

That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.

In the trunk, yeah?

Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.

You have to know what you're talking about.

What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.

But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.

Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?

Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel.

Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.

I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.

No, I didn't know that.

Detroit, you must be pretty busy.

Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.

It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?

Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.

That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.

You're right.  So why take a chance--

Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.

Buddy.  That's his given name?

I thought so, too.

Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?

They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.

Uh-huh.  Well, but if --

I can go to the bar.

I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.

I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.

No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?

Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.

That's not what you were about to say.

Yeah, but in a nice way.

To warn her about Chino.

Why are you mad?

What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?

You're in civilization now, man, ease up.

In the trunk?

These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.

How many?

When?

Oh, uh, right, thanks...

Any time.

Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.

I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.

Five point two.

The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.

The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.

Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.

Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.

Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.

I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.

Really?

Uh-huh.

Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.

I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.

Me?

Why'd he have to do that to that girl?

No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.

Great.  We got one of 'em.

Oh...

What do you want?

You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.

Something better.  Open it.

He's still married though, huh?

Then they're not separated, are they?

You used to like it.

You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.

The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.

He's pretty laid back, confident.

The combination is three-ten-forty-four.

No.  Course not.

I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.

Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.

Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.

Well, I need that...

Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.

Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.

He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming?

You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.

But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?

Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!

If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.

Yes Sir.

You liked that?

You guys know her?!  I gotta have an intro!  Man, I'd like to --

You guys are new?

You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!

Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.

Home of the brave!

The Colonel helped me work it out.

Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.

I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.

Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.

I was grieving too.

You left her.  How's that for a fact?

How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?

They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?

Little less.

Longer?  It's getting shorter.

Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?

You were more like brothers.

He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.

Well...sure.

I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It means "I am an American."  In Chinese.

We can explain, Colonel.

Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.

I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.

It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --

There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --

Brilliant, Admiral.

Learn English, then!

Crank her!

That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.

This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.

Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.

It's that jerk Walter.

Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.

Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.

I mailed it to you on Wednesday.

I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.

I know. Put Scott through college.

Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.

Oh yeah?

You're pretty charming when you want to be.

You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.

Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?

You know I never could stand your sarcasm.

That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!

I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.

You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?

How could you possibly know what I've been going through?

What?

I've got to go now.

You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.

What about Janet?

Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.

Of course.

Take a long walk on a short pier.

That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.

I wish she hadn't.

He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.

Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.

Don't you get along with your parents?

Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?

I can't do that.

That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.

Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.

What?

Just a little. I've had a tough day.

Evelyn, put her to bed.

Mom, is there any coffee left?

I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.

I think they're going to deregulate it.

Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.

It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.

That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.

You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.

Please don't shout.

The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.

How do you feel?

Why don't you go lie down for a while.

Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.

Oh. I forgot.

Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.

I had a dream that Grandma died.

She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?

I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.

I went for a drive. Up in the hills.

We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.

What does Charlie think about that?

What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.

I'm just happy to see you.

I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.

You have an incredible memory.

I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.

Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.

Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.

You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.

All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it fourthirty. I have a rocket club meeting.

Are you doing some kind of science project?

Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!

That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.

Come on, Richard, I'm serious.

I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.

Come on. You can't be serious.

We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...

No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.

I couldn't help it  I loved him.

Did you break up with Charlie?

--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?

God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!

I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...

Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.

Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young.

I'm going out, Dad!

Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.

He pissed me off.

Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?

Yeah...

Go later...

All the time.

Right here, Mom...

In a word, Bob...

K-R-O-one.

What's that on your forehead, pal?

There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.

Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.

Close the law book.

Ready for what, baby?

Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.

No sweat, buddy.

Defined by Webster's as harmless.

Funny.

Little baby girl.

Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?

You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?

How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?

They sabotaged me.

Thank you.

Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.

Not bad.

Let's find you a drink.

Sure. It's fine.

Want to hear my favorite aria?

It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.  Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?

In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.

Yes.

Thank you.

Hi, Mom. It's me.

Are you on one of those conference calls? I hate when you put me on hold.

Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...

I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?

I'll withdraw.  You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?

I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?

Right.

Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?

You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!

Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...

Get real.

Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.

Give me the camera, Joe.

How many do you know?

Okay, Joe...

Fine, Joe.

That's perfectly clear.

Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.

My lettuce is wilting.

Yes, we did.

Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.

Dr. J.!

Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"

Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.

... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...

... It's time to get this society back on track!

It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....

The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.

Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.

Think about what?

Riddick? How close?

Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.

Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.

You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.

No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....

I would try for them.

It's starting....

Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.

Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.

Big Evil?

Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --

Only around humans.

So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.

What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?

Shut up.

<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.

You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.

How many?

25 kilos each, huh?

May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --

-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.

He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.

And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?

You coulda helped. And you didn't.

79 kilos.

We're just burnin' light here.

So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?

What, you're goin' off, too?

70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!

Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.

For now.

Riddick?

And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?

There is no "safe."

The child heard you before any of us could even....

Listen to her? <u>Her</u>? When she was willing to sacrifice us all?

Say that again.

If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?

Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?

They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.

Not if I'm the one.

Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.

Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.

Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.

You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?

That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.

Do you have any weapons?

What are you doing there?

No.

Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.

Let's find them all.

The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.

Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.

Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.

Sustained.

Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.

I admit, I know nothing of your culture.

We're here to stay.

We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.

You don't seem very cut up about it.

Don't bother

So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --

Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.

Yes, I can do that.

At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.

My name is Taylor.

Dr. Zira! Silence that man!

Read it yourself.

Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?

Okay.Up to the cave.

Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.

The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.

Shhhh!

No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.

Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.

Maybe not.

Why not?

Yes, Sir.

Like you, I find it difficult.

Yeah, what is it?

I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.

Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.

What?

Out there man - behind the log.

Yeah.

Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.

She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.

Yeah, just stole me some from the Top's supply but he's stealing it from us anyway.  Chucks are coming. You better 'didi' man.

Fuck it, don't mean nothing, no such thing here as a coward, done your best man, next time y'do better.

Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.

Sounds like it.

...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.

Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.

He dugged his own grave.

That's what he is... Baaaa!

I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.

Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.

Very nice Mitchell turns.

Not tonight.

I see.

You don't sound as if you liked him very much.

No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?

No thank you.

What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.

Sure... but somebody always does..

I don't.

He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.

You didn't have to tell him that.

Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.

Absolutely sure.

Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?

Nothing matters.

I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--

Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.

That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?

But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?

Killaine...

You leave it.

That's right.

Including Killaine.

I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.

That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?

Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.

Magruder does.

I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.

I'm sorry, that's all there is.

You were there when I last saw him.

They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.

I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.

This way.

Got the information on you?

In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.

How's life treating you?

Hardly. Who's the girl?

She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.

On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.

That must hurt.

Would that make me a heel?

Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?

I don't think you locked your door.

See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.

And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.

No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.

I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.

I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.

Would you?

How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.

Talk English.  How do I know you're you?

You get it's brother.

Open it and count it.

I've met her.

Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there.

Should be over there.

Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.

Such as?

Do I know who lives down there?

Did we ever really think it was suicide?

I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.

Oh nothing.

It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.

Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.

I'm interested in who handled it.

The card says so, doesn't it?

A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.

Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.

Yes, sir.

Two.

Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.

What are my orders, sir?

I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.

That's not very kind.

Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--

It's fine, thank you.

To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.

Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?

Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions.  I can't talk about it.

Exactly that.

Of course.

It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.

...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...

Thank you.

Thank you.  We met last week, at the Wajda film.  You won't remember. We didn't actually speak.

No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.

I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.

And I didn't like that man.

No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.

I haven't really thought about it.

No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.

Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.

No jokes.  James is in love.

Oh yes.

You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?

On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--

Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?

Are you up to something?

Fuck off.

You're a piece of shit

Take a look at these.

Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.

Dad.

Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming...

That's good.

Yes, you said.

I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.

Now listen...

And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?

Voila!

Tom . .. bed!  Go on.

Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.

The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.

I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.

Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.

My man!

She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.

Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.

Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?

There's nobody else here...

The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.

What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?

That's the point, isn't it?

Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?

Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--

Well, what're your ideas on these guys?

Got it...

It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.

No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.

Thanks, buddy.

Angelo, we gotta talk.

Yeah, or cashing a check.

Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.

No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--

Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?

I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.

Tyler, put the gun down.

Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!

Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.

Something... in the trees...

Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.

This gets better by the minute.

You never were all that smart... let's go!!!

Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?

This isn't your style, Dillon.

... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...

We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.

What's that, General?

You're not getting any navy contracts.

I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.

I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.

Please, we hardly know each other.

No.

Storage, I think.

Who indeed...

To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.

How are you, Mr. Kross.

Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.

You're not from L.A., huh?

What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.

You mean they don't have hookers.

Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.

They should be.  They're both good at it.

Just a romantic, that's you.

If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.

You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.

I'd say you give a good dollar value.

"Occupational hazard".

I sell them.

Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.

I got a dress, yeah.

Any good?

You're forgiven.

Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.

Thank you.  I would.  Nice.

He died a long time ago.

I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.

He's good at what he does.

Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.

Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.

I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...

Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?

I more than liked it.

It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?

Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --

Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.

Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.

Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!

But, Edward...

Yes...

Vivian's in sales.

Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?

I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?

Have a good day, gentlemen.

And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!

Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.

I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?

Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.

Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --

Was that you?

What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.

Dummy.

School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.

Do I!?  Momma!

And leave all this?  Not in a million.

Kit give me nothin'.

I leave extras, miss.

You're a guest here?

But I always eat like this.

But what if they serve soup?

Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.

Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.

Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.

'Scume me.

I was in here yesterday.

Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?

Then I'm here till I die?

So it's to be torture.

You're a silly girl.

I do not marry tonight.

They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.

"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.

I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.

Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?

And what am I?

You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!

As you wish.

As you wish.

Hear this now: I will come for you.

Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.

But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?

Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.

Gently!!

It never happened.

Anybody want a peanut?

What do I do?

Yes, some of the time. 

-- where?

Right, right, sorry.

What is it?

Someday, you may not mind so much.

All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.

Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.

As you wish...

Sire.

Of course.

In that case --

-- offer me money --

-- offer me everything I ask for --

Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?

Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?

Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.

No good. I've known too many Spaniards.

My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.

Then why are you smiling?

That would be inconceivable.

Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.

For the Princess?

It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.

I will. And I choose --

You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.

Nobody's hearing nothing!

It would take a miracle. Bye!

A little bit.

What?

How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...

I'll wait in the hall ...

Well, sir, it seems ...

Where?  What?

I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?

Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.

It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!

All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.

You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.

You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?

What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.

Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!

Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.

They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.

You found a flop!

Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.

Only if we ask him.

It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.

The majority.  The majority.  Yes. Let's hear from the majority.

Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.

Mr. Liebkind, wait ...

Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.

No kidding?

That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 

We swear it!

Yes.  We would!

It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.

Come on.  Let's get going.

I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.

Hey, Blum, have a cigar.

No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.

Here I come, ready or not.

Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?

I shall count the minutes.

By the sacred memory...

Hindenburg...

The Graf Spee...

Heil you know who!

Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light.

I'm not the police.

Of which morning?

Cash or check? For the cabin...

No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...

Money.

Not even a hunch. Just hope.

What?

How much?

But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?

You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!

Buzz me the minute she comes in.

How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?

She ain't missing so much as she's run away.

A lot?

And the police haven't been able to...

With the forty thousand dollars?

Lila.

Don't you know?

Huh?

How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...

You've led a charmed life.

Where could he have gone?

This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary...

I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...

Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.

The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!

Bates never denied Mary was here.

What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?

Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.

This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.

Can you?

I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.

I'll lick the stamps.

I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.

Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

No.

It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.

Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?

What are you running away from?

Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.

Crane.

Then I'm free to go...?

Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...

Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.

Arbogast.

I didn't think so.

I don't know what you've been saying.

Leave me alone!

Mother, please...

Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?

He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...

Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.

You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!

Did she talk?

You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.

Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.

[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.

Who are you? What is your name?

He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.

Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.

Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.

I'm going to call the police.

It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.

The wound is bleeding!

I'm losing my blood!

Yes, the child ...

But ... the dogs...

Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.

I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.

In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...

Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.

Well, thank goodness, that's settled.

I'd call it stupid at any time.

So that's the way it is?

Thank you.

I'd love to, at any time.

At any time. You will always be welcome.

And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?

It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.

The body of Joan Gale!

Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?

That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.

What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!

No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.

Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.

All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.

Now don't that call for an extra!

About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?

I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!

Don't remember what day that was, do you?

How's every little thing?

I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.

It's all yours.

Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.

Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.

Cry-baby?

My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--

I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.

No, really -- I'm crazy about you.

Good night, sir.

Yes, there's our way out. A fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds.

And you think I will permit this, my friend?

That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?

To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.

Yes.

Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.

You did.

Yes....

What universe are you in, Paul?

Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...

This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.

Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.

Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.

But Rose...

Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...

I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.

Yeah.

Rose, you are too uncritical of people.

Yeah, I'd believe it.

I don't want to know...

Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.

Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.

I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.

In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.

This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.

She's getting herself up to go out.

No.

What are they doing?

What are they doing, Doll?

Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.

She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.

She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.

That's all I want to know.  Lets get out of here before I get the epizootics myself. Thank you, Doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt.

I think we both know her.

And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.

Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.

I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.

Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.

You're not having lunch?

No reason at all, darlin'.

Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.

Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.

Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.

And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!

Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.

Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?

What did you forget?

Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.

If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.

There are more on the other side.

Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.

Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.

Yes, sir.

Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!

Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!

Yes, sir.

What?

Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer.

Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.

Galley proof.

She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!

What do you want me to tell her, Dave?

You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.

Let me be the judge of that, Madam.

No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.

I am thinking particularly of the other ovary. As a rule I don't believe in removing it. The woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished, especially in a girl or young woman. For these reasons I am opposed to removing the other ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?

Illusions, Madam?

Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.

I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...

What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?

Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.

I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.

Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...

Really?  Is that a fact... ?

I need the "when" and the "where."

I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.

Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.

I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.

I can not even begin to imagine how much that must have hurt.

I got him.

Yeah.

Clench your teeth.

Same day as before.  I think.

Feeling great.

It's not gonna happen.

It's go time, Billy-B.

This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?

Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.

There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.

You can't be serious.

We've been chasing this deal six months, and now you're gonna chuck it out the window?

Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.

Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.

You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?

Murderer?  Really?

I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.

It's our job.

You are such a disappointment, Benny.

You know... you could say thank you.

I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.

Dead.

Seatbelts fastened, please.

There's not even enough places to stash it in a car.

Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out soon enough.

It's one of a kind.

That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.

They're... around.

The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.

Yoda will always be with you.

Yoda spoke of another.

Leia! Leia's my sister.

Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.

Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.

A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.

I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.

Hi, Han... Chewie.

I don't know.

Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.

He wasn't. I can feel it.

Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.

Good, I hate long waits.

I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.

We shall double our efforts.

Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.

Quiet.

I see them. Wait, Leia!

She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?

Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?

Never-r-r!

Certainly not!

I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?

Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.

Janet.

Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.

For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.

I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.

We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.

You know this earth - this person.

Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.

Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.

Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.

Cross my heart and hope to die.

Makes you cry

From Transexual Transylvania.

So come up to the Lab.

Now I

Like I'm outside in the rain

Free to try and find a game

Sha la la la That ain't no crime.

Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.

Oh no no no no.

No no no no.

Sha la la la That ain't no crime.

You're too kind.

Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...

...I don't know.

...Goodnight, Rocky.

I think it's closed.

...I suppose.

It doesn't bother me either.

I don't think you're a bum.

Morning after?

'Cause you can't sing or dance?

It's not that --

...I've never been in a man's apartment before.

I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.

Could ya take off that hat.

Yes.

No... Sharp -- You look great.

Ya right --  Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know.

Yeah...

...What?

I gotta go out for a while.

Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.

Why?

Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?

Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!

I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.

Very high an' very fast.

Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?

No wine.

Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.

Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.

I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'

Charge it.

The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --

Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.

That's it, I'm broke.

Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?

Gonna try.

I'm gonna do somethin with it.

...Thanks.

Rocky.

Sparrin'?

I like 'em. If you don't you can f --

'Night, Marie.

I said, how ya feelin'?

Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.

How do you mean?

Ya got heart.

I never had good footwork.

...I'm doin' it for a friend.

I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.

Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.

Real good.

Damn! How's it look?

It ain't your locker no more.

Bullmastiff.

What?

Let's get outta this stink.

I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.

Keep this job, ya eat better.

Sure I like her.

Maybe --

I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.

You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.

What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.

I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.

Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?

If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.

Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.

Maroon, right?

What the hell would they want with a gag factory?

I'll bet.

Surprised?

Earl... it's me, Valiant.

No...

Not much.  It's hard to talk.

Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.

Toons aren't given imperfections.

Why didn't you tell me?

Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?

I don't work in Toontown.

The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.

Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.

No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.

No, I don't.

Take it easy.

Divorce?  Never!

You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.

Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.

Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.

A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.

If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?

We can't do anything till it's dark.

Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?

Safe?

Get away from there.

No, it's not.

Yeah?

I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.

Good idea.

I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?

Uh? Uh?

Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.

Then I'll leave thee.

Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.

Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.

Good-morrow, cousin.

Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

No, cuz, I rather weep.

Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

He shall be endured

The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.

Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.

Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?

Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.

And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.

Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.

Romeo, I drink to thee.

Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!

Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,

Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife

Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.

With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.

I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?

I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.

More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.

Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.

Right.

Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,

What wouldst thou have with me?

As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.

Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.

When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.

So where do you go from here?

I'm up for that...

And who are you?

I thought I did.

Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.

I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.

Not so fast.  Who's that?

Bad company...

In here...

Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.

You'll die if you leave here.

Much to your disappointment, no doubt.

Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.

Yes, Sam's tough alright.

No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control.  Alright, let's do it.

Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

But first you have something to take care of?

Call it a reckoning of character.

Is that right?

My way is better.

Did he bring that with him?

Eat shit and die slowly...

I know cops -- and you're no cop.

To see a man about a thing.

That's what I thought.

And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?

It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.

So is the woman.

Know what?

Gregor's cell phone...

No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.

You don't have to do this.

The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.

I don't know...

Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?

Business keeps you on the road?

If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.

Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.

Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.

Finish the job...

You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.

Gone.  Destroyed.

Gonna be tough.

Seamus Reilly.

How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?

I get the picture.

None of them had any --

I want to get some hounds down here.

Dwayne listen to me -

Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.

Cash and what?

I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.

Why?

It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?

What makes you so sure?

Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?

Maybe.  Who cares?

I don't know.

What's that?

That's not what I mean.

That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.

We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.

Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.

Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!

Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.

He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.

Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!

Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.

That's right.

I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in.

Just take it in stride.

No.  It's not.

OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!

Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.

Nothing.

I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?

He's not, he's...

Booth.  Don't.  It's nothing. It's not worth it.  Remember what happened the last time?

Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.

I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.

What did he buy?

What?

Am I speaking English here?  How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?

We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.

This just might be our ticket!

We appreciate that.

Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.

Lingerie...

Anything...specific?

Hmmm...

No, I can't say that I have.

I can't hear a word you're saying!

Dwayne put the gun down --

Calm down --

We're gonna talk.

At least around here it does.

Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.

Absolutely positively.

Give me the bad news.

There was more than that.

That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?

How much is that?

Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?

I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?

This is your ship?

El Capitan?

The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."

What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?

It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.

I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.

That's right.

Oh yes, she's very nice.

Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.

Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!

Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?

You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.

Try to land on your feet.

How you doin'?

Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.

This is a very dangerous man.

I'm calling for back up!

Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.

You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?

And you ain't black!

Detective Yu?  Never met him.

Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.

Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.

Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!

Ask me if I give a shit.

Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.

Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.

He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.

How do you know?

She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.

Take it!

It's a bomb.

For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.

Fine by me.

No.

Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.

They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.

Who's Benjamin?

A Chinese man discovered electricity.

End of the line.

Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.

No.  I'm going to find out.

I did!

No problem.

She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.

Yes.

This money is evidence.

Some Kung-Pao?

What "revenge" is he talking about?

Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.

Excuse me?

I need your help.

Why don't you go get them?

Baby Duck?

Any leads?

The police can protect you.

Tell me why they killed the customs agents.

Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.

Yes, Master.

I know, Master, but...

Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --

The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.

In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.

OK. Say what it is.

Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.

This is pathetic.

Tell me about it.

Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.

I know a shortcut.

Stooly.

Stool pigeon.

Thank you. I learn a great deal.

Who does not know War?  ³War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.²

Yee-aww.

Going into the restaurant.

I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.

Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.

Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.

What's wrong with that?

No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.

Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?

What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.

You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.

Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...

Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.

That's what you were supposed to be!

And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.

Shut up!

Nobody touches me.

Ambassador Han.

Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.

Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.

I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...

Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got em.

Don't worry, he's with Carter.

How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?

Maintain eye contact.

What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?

What did he ask?

Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--

Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.

He's here!... He's here!

Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?

No.  No, you didn't.

I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.

Since when does Ellie need moral supp--

What are you trying to say to me, Fish?

The real story on Miss Carpenter.

It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.

"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.

Then come for dinner.

Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?

She's a cacophony of contradictions.

And you defending her?

Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.

No, she's talking about your hair.

That must have made you proud.

Betty Trout.  Five dollars.

Bye, Betty.  Thanks.

Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.

Yes.

Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.

We'll see.

A pre-wedding luau?

He is not!

I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?

Really.

Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.

Seven-fifty.

He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.

Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?

Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.

I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.

Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.

I'd rather not.

A little longer for me.

Well, you do have the dress.

I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.

I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.

Where?

No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.

No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".

Not eight...

Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.

No.  It's my life.

So you're angry.  Big deal.

It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.

They're going to love you.

My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.

Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.

How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.

Go for a walk in Central Park --

What is it?

So what happened?

About what?

Not.

They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...

"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --

I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.

I always wondered about that too.

Turn on your radio!

Becky?

M.F.E.O.?

We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.

You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --

This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --

Walter and I are engaged!

We'll move them --

Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.

Magic.

Like... clockwork.

It's a sign.

Sure you do --

Magic.

It's me?

Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --

I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.

And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling. 

It's not for me.  It's for my dad.  I think he needs a new wife.

I don't know --

Seventy... eight.

I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.

What's tira misu?

What is it?

This is going to be tougher than I thought.

I don't get it.

What is it?

It's never happening again. Right?

They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."

Dad, you're not taking this seriously.

Go to sleep.

Is that what she used to sing?

Good.

Sleepless and Son.  Baltimore.

There she is.

She's going to cook something for us?

No.

If she knew, she'd never forgive me.  It would be hopeless for the two of you.

Who is Annie?

It might be in the kitchen.

This is the one I like.

I can't know what I said, but we're not going.

Goddammit, I am sick of this --

Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --

Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?

Thanks, but... we've got plans.

What do you mean?

Hi.

You look good yourself.

I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --

No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.

That's none of their affair.

How's it going?

It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.

It never ends.

He will if he wants us to go on blasting.

You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.

Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?

I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.

What?

What's more important than sanitation?

I'm a fool.

It's nothing. Just a little catch ...

He'll have it good. Some day.

What makes you so sure?

But it's yours. I won't let them ...

I'm going back tomorrow.

Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.

Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.

Be still ...

We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.

Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.

Like what?

What are you saying?

Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.

Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?

Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?

Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?

Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!

She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.

You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...

Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!

Now that's down-right insulting.

Everything go?

Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises

I understand. Thanks anyway.

I was thinking Alice Cooper.

I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.

Nothing.

Why not?

You get off on abuse or something?

Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.

How?

Don't worry. He's out of town.

Trust me. We're safe.

Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?

Please open the door, Danny.

They would have killed you too.

What?

It's Tom.

I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.

It's not too late to show her you're sorry.

Guess it's our turn.

I know a guy.

10%.  That's ...

You aren't coming with me.

It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?

I don't trust anybody.

Make me an offer.

I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.

Hey, okay.

Why do you say that?

Hey, I was just trying to ...

Pull your motherfucking pants down.

Big Bill.

Just some buddies.

What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?

Bobby, rhymes with hobby.

It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.

Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.

The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.

Question is, what are you doing here?

I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.

This chink have a name?

For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.

We got the 411 on your good old boy.

And what does this have to do with me?

Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.

Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.

They have. But they never found a lab.

What if he caps me before you can make a move?

You mean the menacing red car?

I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.

Thank you.  Thank you very much.

Again, I thank you.

Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?

Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.

Why are you doing this?

Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.

Don't we always take good care of you?

Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.

Don't worry about it.

No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.

The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.

In West Fork?

Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.

Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.

I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.

Nope, he ain't Wade.

I'd love to hear it.

In the shadow by those two trees.

Gives Wade the second shot.

You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?

That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.

Senator's son?

FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!

Where are you from, Captain?

I don't expect to live that long.

Did he see any sign of them?

Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.

Same place we are.

You don't count.

Those guns are close.

Goddamn it, sir...

Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.

Simpson.

Okay, Wade.  Translators?

Hell of a mission.

Since when have things been normal?

Three for three.

How about I go right, sir?

More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...

Vecchio.

It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.

Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.

Just what I want to do.

You're welcome, John.

Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?

Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...

No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?

Yeah, how so?

We can't leave it here.

Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.

I thought you said we had an hour, sir?

Why's that?

Have it your way, Captain.

Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.

HERE THEY COME!

More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.

I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.

Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?

No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.

Yes, sir.

Struggling with a pair of Germans.

Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.

Upham and Jackson, what were they like?

...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.

Lingerie.

We know.

Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!

It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...

Who knows?  It worked.

We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.

Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.

So you refuse to answer my questions?

And your former wife.

Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 

Oh yeah, let me give you another card.

Hey, sis.

Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.

I'm gonna call her.

Lloyd.

C'mon Lloyd.

Okay, I got it.

Hang in there, man.

I admit nothing.

You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.

Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.

Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.

If she wants me, she can come to me.

He wants to leave things on a good note.

It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.

I can accept that.

Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!

Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.

You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.

Goodnight.

Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.

Bon voyage.

Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.

Swear to god.

No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.

No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.

Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.

Yeah.

Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"

They knew of you.  Now they know you.

Or, or I could always wear this one.

Yeah?

I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?

Okay.

Wait, wait.  You told her about me?

I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?

I just can't have any social life right now.

Yeah.

Right.

Oh.  I was putting the...

Yeah.

I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.

What's wrong?

You need to study?

We decided...

Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.

No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.

Lloyd, I love you, okay?

Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.

Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.

I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?

Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?

Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.

Man, you're bringing me down!

Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.

Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.

Your car?

Hey.

How you doin', brother?

You know Diane Court?

Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.

Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.

I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?

Sir, the list is correct.

Klaus Tauber.

A charade?  How could it be a charade?

I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.

I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.

In Breslau.

You're kidding.

Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.

They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.

It's good business.

All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.

Takes diamonds to stay on this list.

She's good.

Things are great, things are great.

He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?

I think most people right now have other priorities.

The war could end.

There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.

Do what?

Christmas presents.

And killing.

I think it's too late.

They arrived, can you believe it?

No, no, what, what is it?

He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.

37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.

That doesn't work, sir.

Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...

Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.

On national television.

What is it?

Someone who wants to talk to you.

That's too bad.

What if I said you?

Don't forget to set the alarm.

Can we talk?

You could start with an apology.

Did it?

You have a right to be angry.

Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.

No, I don't.

Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.

I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.

I think it's out of your control.

No, it's not.

Good question. You took the bait.

Until now.

The way I see it. Well be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.

Tuitions expensive.

And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.

Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.

How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?

Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.

I think you're all an act.

I know that.

I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.

Can we turn the light on?

And Joel's pre-med.

Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.

Let's find out.

He filmed his victims.

Don't worry...

I'll give you one guess.

You're pretty when you're angry.

I'm everywhere.

Are you in danger now?

Don't do this.

I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.

No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.

The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house." etc.

Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.

Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.

Thanks, Joel.

Gale?

Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.

I get scared really easy, okay.

Where you going?

I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.

Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.

Do I?

Wait, wait. Don't hang up.

But your voice sounds so familiar.

Thanks.

More of a game really.

Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?

I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?

Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?

Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.

Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.

I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.

I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.

Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.

Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.

Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?

Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?

I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.

I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.

What does this have to do with Sid?

Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.

She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.

No.

Help me Sid! The killer's got me!

All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?

Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!

Just Jennifer.  And you.

I am Gale Weathers!

Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.

It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.

Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.

Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"

All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!

Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!

Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?

Yes.

How do I know their voices are --

You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.

Well then the people you need to call are the police.

Piece of cake. She'll be there.

I was just asking. Why are you always at me?

Oh yeah.

That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.

You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.

Where the fuck did she go?

See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?

Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?

You lost your mom...

Oh Sidney...

Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.

I called my dad.

I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.

Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?

I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.

To apologize.

Really? What?

What's your favorite scary movie?

They'd never make it in time.

Or else what?

I'm getting scared.

Come on. It'll be fun.

Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.

Come on, yes you do.

NOOOO....

It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.

Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.

No, not yet.

Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.

I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?

She's with me. I just wanted to check on things.

He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?

Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.

Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.

Afraid not.

What about the cellular phone bill?

Keeping my eye on Sidney.

You think he could still be in town?

Yes, sir.

You want to go live?

But it's so much easier when we make it up.

I'll send you a copy.

Forget it.

What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.

And why would she do that?

And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.

LEAVEMEALONE!

No you didn't.

Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.

Before she dumped him for Steve.

I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.

So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.

I can cry on cue.

Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.

Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?

You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.

I'm not worried.

He was there, Tatum.

I bet he's pissed.

I don't know...

He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.

There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.

Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.

I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.

I read about it in the paper.

Turn around.  Hands on your head!

Put it down.  Put it on the ground.

NO!

You know that's not true.

Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.

Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.

Murderers?

We would have gotten you eventually.

Maybe I'm not understanding the question.

I realize that.

Guessing at this point is useless.

Good.

I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.

This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.

What?

Tonight.

Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.

Nothing.

We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.

Just wait!

Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.

Bullshit.

Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.

Oh, it's alright.

No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.

And so what?

Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.

I don't know... like fifty.

Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.

I don't.  Neither do you.

Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.

You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.

Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.

How can you say that?  Especially after today?

You do your job...

People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.

Call for help, and you'll live.  But, you'll be disfigured.  Or, put yourself out of your misery.

No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.

Big surprise.

What?

Oh... um, William.

No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.

He mentioned it.

This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.

It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...

It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre!  Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?

What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...

AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...

I ain't wearing no gun.

Dunno...Seems so.

He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.

That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...

This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?

There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...

Now mount up, son...

Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...

God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...

All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...

JOINT action?

I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...

Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...

Ain't yours yet.

Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.

Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...

He just couldn't wait...

What?

Cut it out, will ya...

Look?

Not likely.

Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?

They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...

I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!

You've seen her!...She's alive?

<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!

Only if I'm dead!

"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."

It still worked in town.

We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.

And two months later, we got married.  And all because of one sentence:  "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."

So do I, believe me.

Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.

I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!

Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!

In the village.  Look what I found.

What? What am I supposed to sense?

Hi, darling.

This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.

'HE'?  Whom do you mean-

...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.

Does this dog here belong to you?

You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.

I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...

Just call me Elisabeth.

Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?

How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...

Tenth floor.

I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?

Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.

It's good.

And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.

Really?

Then tomorrow you will have the pages.

Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.

I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.

A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.

Ned is wrong for it.

Done.

And yet you tell me you lie with women?

Nothing comes.

It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.

On my mother's side the Ardens

Yes, I saw it.

Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.

As soon as I have found my muse

What piece? Richard Crookback?

To my weekly confession.

Is it about a pirate's daughter?

Tomorrow

The one who came with your letter?

Go on.

I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.

I thought your play was for Burbage.

"Not having that which, having, makes them short."

Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.

Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.

I am not so well-born.

Verona again.

Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.

You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!

Your Majesty.

No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.

Can you love a player?

It is strange to me, too.

Mr. Henslowe?

It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!

Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.

You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.

Oh, my love  You ran from me before.

A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?

Nor you for me.

You flatter, my lord.

Do you intend to marry, my lord?

I do not love you, my lord.

But why me?

Lady Viola isyoung in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.

Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?

Does she say so?

I  Her letter came to me by the nurse.

Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!

Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!

For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!

I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.

A man, my lord?

A theatre poet?

Serve.

About what?

I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.

Can I show you something?

Think about it.

We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?

I don't know.

You're sure? There's lots more.

Looking for you? Yes.

It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.

It's all right. I'll forward your mail.

Not at all.

About the mail --

What does it look like?

And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?

No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.

Yes.

Cameron?

Just serve.

Alex.

Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.

Open it.

Yes.

Don't look?

It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.

Is that all?

I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.

I want my money back. Excuse me.

Who?

No, I don't.

You were magnificent.

Yeah, you're making us all nervous.

Be like a weight off your shoulders.

Your painful groin?

I'll wait there.

Oh, shut up, Alex.

I see.

Burglary?

Of course.

Yes, absolutely.

That was stressful. I found that stressful.

Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.

Well, it's a wide range of, eh --

What happened to that guy?

That's what I thought.

Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.

Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.

I'm a doctor.

That sounds fine.

What?

Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.

Is it real?

Yeah, baby, how's it going?

Why?

Yes, but... I thought...

Lester, don't you think that uhh --

Yes, sweetheart, shh.

That's okay too.

-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.

Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --

What are you talking about?

No.

Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.

I gotta talk to you.

-- What?

Whatever you say.

Why don't you see Lester?

I wouldn't say so if I didn't.

No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.

I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.

No.

No thanks.

Gee, this is great.

Yeah... I've made it with a girl...

Why?

Don't make conversation with me.

You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.

Then what do you think?

I am not!

Right.

Right.

I guess not...

Oh fuck, Norman!

Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.

Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.

He's a very private person, actually.

Yeah, I think so...

Okay.

Whew.

Yeah, baby...

Fuckin' A --

-- look, you don't have to entertain me...

Look who's talking.

-- well you better go after her.

-- you've got to leave.

Lester's on his way.

No --

If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...

Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.

What?

What?

If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!

Okay... thanks...

Hey, baby, what's happening?

What're you talking about?

Where?

Well, like what?

No shit?

George, I don't --

Fine. How are you?

I am?

Okay, baby. Okay...

Hey, baby, what's happening?

Could I?

Okay.

Just a second, I'll be right with you...

Your advice!

What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.

Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.

Commercials.

I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...

That's all you've got to say?

-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?

Did you?

What did you say?

What did you say?

I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.

I'm better than the guy I work for.

After a while that hurts... doesn't it?

Sure.

When?

I don't know what to...

Your hair looks -- well fabulous.

Layered?

Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.

Who?

What about her?

No.

You do?

-- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.

Steve?

Then you were talking to him.

Jesus, she's my best friend.

I'll call you.

I know, I'm sorry.

But you have problems?

I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.

Honey?

I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.

-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.

-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...

No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?

-- no.

Of course not.

You mean when are you going to Egypt?

-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.

-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...

-- just wonderful.

No... how long did you say?

No.

Where to, Les?

Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.

Yes?

Do you like this hotel?

What?

Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.

Do they know he tell you things?

Try to think what it was.

Is there something bad here?

You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?

Okay, Mom.

Okay.  You behave yourself.

Yeah.

Not right now, Daddy's asleep.

Danny... what's the matter, hon?

No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.

Why not?

Yes.

Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?

Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.

Yes, sir.

Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?

A nigger cook.

Thank you very much.  I'll do that.

Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.

Thank you for saying so.

Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.

God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?

Yeah.

What time is it?

I guess we've been staying up too late.

Hmm, nice.

I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.

Which room was it?

How do you like it?

I can't really remember.

Oh Jack, what are you talking about?

Why?

I'm not going to hurt you.

Wendy give me the bat.

Give me the bat.

Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.

Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.

shut in together over long periods of time.

No, my son's discovered the games room.

Oh!

Eight thirty.

I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.

Blue. This blue.

A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?

But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.

Sure.

You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.

I told you!

You're not going to let it go, are you?

But Uncle Al! You said-

If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.

Perhaps.

LET THY SOUL BE HEALED

You know what we're saying!

SING!

SING!

We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.

'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.

Today was the deadline, Vince.

You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?

Yes?

Good evening, Vincent.

I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.

The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE

Because we're

That man -- who is he?

Enough jabber.

I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.

Um, I don't really know this one...

You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.

I knew that.

Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!

Sing!

Five a.m.?

She won't?  Why not?

She said that?  Reverend Mother?

It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.

Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.

Oh no.  We'll always be together.

Again?

Don't you know it!

Your name?

I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?

Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.

You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!

What?

You mean black people?

Would you like that?

As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.

A what?

No food?

From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 

Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!

You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?

Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."

Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!

What?

What do you mean?

Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?

You have a phone call.

Really.  Well, that makes two of us.

I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.

I must go where I can be of use.

At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.

'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!

Then-you run.

Okay -- no limo.

Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.

You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...

You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!

Really.

You won't even tell us?

Not... totally.

Maybe pants.

Which one!

She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!

She's praying.

That should have tipped us.

However, we can also pray for other things.

He's decent.

Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?

And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...

Impossible.

Find 'em!

How did you hear this?

Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.

Two days... ?  For murder?

I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.

To place it inside its coffin.

What is that?

A diseased monster.

Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.

Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!

A fine idea.

Have they nothing to fear presently?

Is that all you say?  Look at her.

Believe?

I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...

How could he?

What kind of nuts?

No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.

"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.

Stay back.

Lady Van Tassel...

Tired.

May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?

Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?

I insist that you have it.

No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...

There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.

I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.

She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?

A woman should not be out alone in these woods.

Just... keep where you are.

Come with me.

Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?

I... I can't do this.

What... ?

To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?

You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.

No one will believe your lies, whore.

No, sir, please... she is innocent...

No.

Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.

Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.

Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.

Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.

Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?

Good to know you, Karl.

How are you, Bill?

Is him stayin' here workin' out?

What do you like to eat here?

What you got in there, warshing?

Karl's my name.

I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.

You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.

He does make some funny noises.

Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.

Don't tell me what to do.

Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.

Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V. Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here.

You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'. The adults are talkin'. Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?

Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.

I get nervous, that's all I know.

I know Albert. We're friends.

What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.

If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head. He's already off balance.

It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.

I thought I told you to keep out!

A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.

Childers.

How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?

I aim to kill you with it.

I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.

They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.

Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.

My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.

Yeah, I did.

I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.

That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.

Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.

That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.

All right then.

Yes sir. You ort not know that language.

He ain't no count.

A little ol' boy.

You will? For sure?

Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?

Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?

Nice to meet you, Karl.

I'm glad of it, honey.

I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.

Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.

I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.

Yeah.

You better go get your things.

Naw.

That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.

I'll be dog.

Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.

I could shore use some. Thank ye.

Ma'am?

Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.

Not really to speak of.

Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.

I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.

This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.

Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?

Vaughan, don't get pushy.

Do you smell shit?

Why won't he talk to women?

Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.

I knew he slept in a toolshed.

We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.

Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.

Why?

I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.

Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.

Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.

Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.

That's the subject of my last chapter.

Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.

It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.

I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.

Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?

I'd love to.

Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.

Huh?

What's that, Sol?

That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.

Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?

Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.

Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.

He's crazy.

Fuck you, kid.

That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.

Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.

You got it.

Ready. Any time you are.

And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?

I mean, it's a good story.

Eighteen and a half years.

Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.

Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.

It means "happiness."

Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.

I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.

Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.

Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.

Five thousand bucks.

It's all yours, baby.

I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.

Ruby McNutt. My one true love.

And why the hell would you give me money?

Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.

I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.

And how much are these?

Thanks for the tip.

What does that mean?

What can I do for you?

How the hell did you get into the building?

That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.

I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.

And?

Those are pretty hostile words.

You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?

Not a one.

What's your offer?

I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.

Well what?

An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!

I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?

Tick-tock, tick-tock.

I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...

I owe you something.

You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.

Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?

I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?

Nice drawing. Did you do that?

Yeah, I can believe it.

Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.

Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?

And how long did I tell you you could stay?

No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.

Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.

Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.

If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.

Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.

Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.

Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?

Is it yours?

Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.

What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.

I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.

If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 

Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...

Oh, yeh?

You don't.

I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.

In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?

Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.

Is that your third question?

Well, what if?

Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.

Why not?

Look at my face.  It's the face of the people who did that.  My father hardly speaks English.  We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.

I did.  But the jury won't s...

Those aren't the facts that matter.

Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.

These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip.

And the next one...?

Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?

I'm sorry, was there a question in there?

Twelve.

Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.

But even <u>after</u> you had an attorney.  You still claimed to know <u>nothing</u>.  Claimed <u>not</u> to have seen Carl. Am I correct?

Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.

You're right.  I better use two.

Still lashed to the mast.

Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?

The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.

We have a warrant.  To search your boat.

Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.

Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.

Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.

You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.

She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.

Obviously.

If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.

I already said that, b...

Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?

<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.

Carl never lied.

That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.

I suppose you want a tip?

Me?  I'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman.

Clarinet - drums - trumpet - trombone -

I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.

It's entirely mutual.

What did he say?

Stop, or I'll burst out crying.

Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.

Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?

Hey, Joe!

I told you - it's a sure thing.

With you.

So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?

I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.

No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -

Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.

With those legs?  Are you crazy?

The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.

I never did like the name Geraldine.

Listen, stupe - no butter and no pastry. We're on a diet!

Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.

You tore it again!

I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -

Good night, Josephine.

It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.

You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?

We can get a job with another band. A male band.

Don't get burned, Daphne.

No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.

Oh, no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.

I am.

Like right after the ceremony.

But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!

Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.

I may throw up.

We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.

Tell him you're going to elope with him.

There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.

Good night, honey.

If there's anything I can do for you -

Sssh.  Sweet Sue.

I have a very low resistance.

Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.

She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.

What's that?

Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -

Oh yes, we do!

Yes.

Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -

This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.

The Florida job?

Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!

You don't say.

Goodbye?

Oh, you don't get off that easy.

Yes, Osgood?

Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.

And I smoke. I smoke all the time.

Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -

Why?

Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?

We'll take it!

You two from the Poliakoff Agency?

I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.

So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.

I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -

Glasses?

Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?

Would you mind terribly?

Not at all.

No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -

What theory?

I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.

Oh, I didn't hear you come in.

I am?

I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.

It's sort of funny - you being out of gas - I mean, Shell Oil and everything -

Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?

Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.

Caught him off Cape Hatteras.

I don't mind if I do.

It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.

What happened?

Have you ever tried American girls?

I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.

If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.

What is it?

From a rich millionaire.

Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...

I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.

Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.

But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.

What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.

Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.

I don't know.  All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.

I know.  Every time!

Coffee?

I never join nothin'.

From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?

If you want to, you can call your lawyer.

That's an opera, you ignoramus.

If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.

So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.

No, Spats - no, no, no -  NO!

What? Why? What do you mean?

Are you sure youre okay?

Hey.

Its not me. I swear. Its her. Shes magic.

Actually, I do.

Or Kat....

Im not as square as my daughter thinks.

Im sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.

Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.

I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.

Mom, please.

She did?

Um, just about everyone.

Dont be ridiculous. Its late and the place is empty. Just take my car.

Shrink, actually.

What?

Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings.  I think Im her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.

Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.

You have feet?

Why?

Its cute.

Thats right. Imagine facing it alone.

If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.

Shampoo, got it!

I guess so.

Okay.

Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda of escorts.

Not dollars. Pounds.

Yup. Thats why you get to keep your money.

Sure, but its never easy. They say theyre okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyre not.

Make out with you for free.

Spontaneously combust?

Youve always got that to hide behind, dont you? Its just business!

Therapist.

Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.

...but its getting there. 

Hard.

What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nations most precious resource: your daughter.

Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?

It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!

You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...

You could? How?

Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...

But where is my daddy!?

Yes mam...

You would do that, wouldn't you?

Here, put my jacket over you.

You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!

Hi, Daddy...

Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.

Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.

Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?

Yes, Daddy! Yes!

Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.

Why don't you try and git you a new dog?

Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.

Same as we -- they pray.

David, come back here!

'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.

You sure can, son...

No mam -- I looked all over.

Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!

I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.

What did the Lord tell you, Ike?

Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!

Might be...

I shore could, Miss Rebecca.

What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?

Little chilly.

Well, let's get to it, Miss Rebecca,'cause I been waitin' too long a time for your good cookin'!

I wanta see Nathan.

I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!

Will they give him a trial?

You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!

Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.

Pillow.

I said -

What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of here.

But what are we going to do against this entire army?

We're going... Let's run through the plan!!

I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!

Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.

Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!

'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.

It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!

Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.

Oh.

WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!

No way.

I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!!  AGH! I can't say pissed off?!  AGH!!

Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.

Oh no, it's that kid.

Baba mama!

MPH RM!!!

Aw, ma!!

Uhh... I don't know.

Yeah, I guess.

God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.

Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?

For pooping, silly.

Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.

I don't know, dude.

I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!

Totally!

I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight!  <b>Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!</b>

Yeah, so what do we say?

He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.

Right away, ma'am!

Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.

Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.

Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.

Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.

YOU'D fuck your uncle!

This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!

Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!

I know.

You don't care.

THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!

Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?

Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?

Oh yeah...

They're not going to make it!

I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.

They are awaiting further information.

My...wings...

Well shut it off at once!

I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.

That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.

Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?

Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!

What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -

Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?

Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.

Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.

Like that piece of ass he was with.

Will you shut up already?

I don't know.

Probably come through the wall I suppose.

Just considering our options... sir.

Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?

Wait.

Ready as I'll ever be.

So we did.

What?  What are you talking about?

Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.

I can't!

How does the distress signal look?

Over and out.

And so far.

Congratulations on your...recent award.

Homesick?  It's only been two days!

Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.

I guess so.

Mac.  What's shaking?

What kind of man?

Find your bowler?

My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.

Nope.

Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.

Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.

You afraid we're gonna steal it?

When you get a chance.

We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?

You listen to the feelings, not the words.

gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.

Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.

Theo's bowled on the tour.

A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.

I'm not on the tour this year.

I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.

She's my mom.

The small ball.

Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.

I gotta survive.

He says that to all his wives.

See ya 'round Maynard.

Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.

Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.

You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.

Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.

Junior who?

It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".

No!

Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.

He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.

What ever happened to just bowling?

How Mr. Kastle?

Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!

Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.

No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.

I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.

Whips...orange whips.

How do you want it?  The eggs.

Coming right up.

I'd rather you didn't.

I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.

No, I'm fascinated.

I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.

Well, that was plan A.

Plan B is your dad.

He said he'd sponsor me.

Nothing.

What's plan C?

So why do you stay?

I could let them go for ten.

Zip.

It's Junior, isn't it.

I feel sick.

I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.

I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.

I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.

I'm not here to bowl.

We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.

So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.

Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.

Calm down, Dr. Levine.

Open it, Captain!

It's burning...

I can't see...

How about I just press the button?

What was that?

High Voltage?

Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.

He's right beneath us.

Pull it, damn it!

Storm?  What storm?

Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?

As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.

Geologists?

But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.

What's wrong with oxygen?

I don't know.  But it's something alien.

I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.

No "buts".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.

How drastic?

I think I do.

I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.

Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...

Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.

In a minute, sir.

I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts.  The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.

I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?

Yes, Harry.

The what?

Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.

Please watch your closest monitor...

He understands me fine.

The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.

What are you going to do -- shoot her?

What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?

Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.

Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!

To what?

What was Edmunds doing outside?

The timing has never seemed quite right.

Yeah.  Drowning.

Get this thing off me.

Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.

My gosh, Norman.

Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.

Beth --

Beth.

So what?

You did, didn't you?

It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.

We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.

Why should I go?

Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.

You think?

All I know is I opened that refridgerator --

What?

What do you mean, a part of Harry?

Which I told Barnes was attacking --

Valdomet.

Antibiotic.

Causes sleep.

"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "

I'll just boost the doses.

What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.

Beth --

You want to kill him?

Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?

Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.

If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?

What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?

No, he isn't.

No, he can't.

And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.

One lonely, terrifying sea snake.

But I have to, Norman.

Get away from the door, Beth.

You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?

I --

Beth -- gimme the gun.

What?

It doesn't make any sense.

You'd have to ask them.

It's an American spacecraft.

Like what?  I'm not --

We can refuse to talk.

To what?

On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.

Gimme another explanation.

Am I?

What are you still doing here?

Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.

Wisconsin?

How do we decode it?

The three of us.

Stop what?  What are you -- ?

Are you trying, damn it?  Just --

No idea.

To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.

Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.

Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.

Think about it.

Please.  It must have flown here --

"We are friends".

No, they didn't say --

Captain who?

Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.

Who's everyone?

You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?

Like what?

I don't see anything.

When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.

Not that I know of.  Why?

Four.  Four years --

What?

You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.

I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.

Who's going to pay me then?

Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!

You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.

You could put it that way.

But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.

That's where my father was killed.

He's bluffing...

I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.

I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.

At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.

I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?

It's automatic.

Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.

Why didn't you say so before.

Come back here... Where are you going?

They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.

Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.

But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!

Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...

If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.

Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.

I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.

For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.

What an honor...

Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !

It's what I deserve.

YAAAAAAAA !

Not enough, I guess.

We're the old men, Ace.

Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?

Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.

I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.

Don't you have to finish the game ?

Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...

This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.

They revoke our flight status.

Hey, check it.

THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !

Funny...

No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.

Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...

You're upset, that's alright.

How come that's all you talk about anymore ?

How do I know if this is love ?

Good luck at the academy.

I don't even know if you're my girl.

Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.

Alright, I love you.

I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !

Should I be ?

I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !

We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.

That was just a mix up.

What happened to your eye ?

I like it. It's kinda...you.

Thank you, ma'am.

Ibanez...LET'S GO !

You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?

Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.

You got it.

That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !

A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.

Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.

Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.

Good luck. It's not there anymore.

Sir, yes, sir !

I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.

Uh, no.

You can never be sure.

This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?

Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-

Not a problem.

Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.

Kill the bitch.

Yes, sir...

Yes, sir !

Cover us, Ace !

That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.

To join with him.

Who is V'ger?

The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.

To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.

It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.

No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.

None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.

I'm aware of that, sir.

How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!

Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!

I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.

This served the purpose.

That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!

   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.

No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...

Our Exec and Science Officer...

Impact in fifteen seconds...

Ten seconds....

Viewer, standard ahead.

He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.

We're already two settings below that, sir.

Hold relative position here...

Viewer ahead, sir.

Thrusters ahead, one third.

Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?

See that it is.  Take me over, please.

Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...

I want him here.  Sit down!

Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...

But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.

Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!

I am seeking answers, Captain.

A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.

No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!

Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.

Precisely.

That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.

Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...

Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.

Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...

I'm goin off-shift.  Come on...I'll walk you home.

Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.

You wrote a play on it, what play is that?

That's true.  You grow up here?

No, no, I see...

Of course.

Goodbye.

No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...

Everyday things...yes.

Surest thing you know.

I love your script.

Well, first, you got to change the title...

They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.

You got a paperclip?

Never saw the point of 'em.

Better idea...

You believe that?

I used to go out with a politician.

I hurt you?

...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...

That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...

Hi.

Is it...

I'd love to.

It does?

...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...

Not without a rolltop desk.

Happen to know where there's one for sale.

I saw...

Carla was in the car, right?

Water or mineral deposits.

What is it, a surprise?

Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...

We had a date.

Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?

Well, then, what's he doing here?

Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.

Hi.

Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...

I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!

You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.

I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...

What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...

Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...

This horse is booked.

Uh, <u>look</u>....

She wasn't in the...

Nothing happened.

It's...

Bourbon and Milk.



He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?

You mind...?

I'm ready!

Of course he...

I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...

Thank you.

I think he's moved...

Who is it raped you?

He's on the Island, he'll be back on...

I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...

It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...

Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...

I know, I know.

We, we have to give it.

The minute I read that script I said...

...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...

Well, Joe said it, and he's right.

Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?

Doug, this is Mr...

I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:

This young woman.

Later for you, pal.

Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.

What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?

How about that.

I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...

Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...

You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?

You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?

I know you do.

You want me to lie.

The girl was in the car.

I...

I didn't say anything to them.

I don't...

I left that for you.

They're coming Fedex...

My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.

That's what I said.

That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...

She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.

"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."

That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.

Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...

That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...

...it is?

George, that is so kind of you.

No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...

Waal, what was the per-screen average...?

Ain't no second chances in life.

...we can't lose the wind...

I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!

Mommy's marrying Rache!

I hate when you say that.

Excellent point.

Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.

Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --

Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.

Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...

Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!

Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!

She is but an arriviste.

Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...

Maybe twenty.

Don't. Take me with you.

Until he's old enough to read.

Here.

And this is my room so get out!

Why don't you say hello?

Annabelle pick up the phone.

You think this is funny?

Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.

Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?

But Rache...

There you are!

Annabelle put down that camera.

There's worse things.

Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --

Annabelle let's get something clear.

Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.

No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.

I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?

Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!

Is that like Luigi's?

Where are you, anyway?

Thursday's fine...

Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.

Before you.

Rache says it's from you.

You dying.

So where are you?

Can I talk to you?  When you're there.

You've got a fruit loop in your hair.

Every day.  More and more.

Let's take our best shot.

Have you still never told him?

Remarried.  There is no move.

You think I didn't get that?

They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.

You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...

Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!

<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.

Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.

Never stand between that kid and a meatball.

Maybe you could back off just a little bit --

Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.

I did it for her.

Why not just bring the whole toilet?

Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.

You're taking the kids.  And moving to San Francisco.

...it's my problem, too.

How would you know <u>anything</u>?

Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.

Beats me.  Ask your mom.

Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.

Feeling the pressure?

Is that what he told you?

Are we.

That's not wh...

Oh please.

She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.

You're the hip and fresh.

I have their past.

It was a veal stock, I thi...

Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...

Rache, get out of th...

I think so...What do you think?

It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.

I know that.

...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...

By way of saying you were unhappy.

How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?

I'm gonna get me a drink.

Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?

Hey. What's up?

Thank you.

Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.

I did not go to high school.

We had to work. My family was poor.

Poison gas.

He wasn't.

I know!

Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.

You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.

You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?

Yes, I knowBut still, it should be somewhat entertaining.

What?

You started filling out your college applications yet?

Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.

I dunno.

Fine.

You mean, again?

I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.

You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.

Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.

The same.

Man, it's just, like, conversation.

Gee, you're home early!

What are you doing here?

Uh huh.

No.

...gger.

Toby Oxman.

Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.

I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.

N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?

Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah, sure.

Thanks.

HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.

Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.

What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.

If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.

I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.

What happened?

What are you talking about?

Because I'll be firing at them.

Well Cooper...

I don't see why they wouldn't be.

It's nothing to worry about.

You're going to pay for this...

Like where--in your dreams?

The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!

We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.

I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.

What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.

Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.

We can't--it's power driven!

Certainly - how about some breakfast?

Yes, of course.

Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.

That's preposterous!  We have no such program!

Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.

It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.

And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.

Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?

What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.

It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.  R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R, or T...R...T...

Look, I didn't shoot him!

Colonel, don't you know what's going on?

Didn't they tell you?

Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?

He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?

What is your name, young lady?

What did you say?

Yes?

Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.

Do you recognize my voice?

No, sir.

To you, sir.  But how do I know?

Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.

And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?

Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.

Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?

But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.

You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.

If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?

You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't

You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?

I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.

Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.

If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.

I presume the planes are armed?

Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?

What the hell is Plan-R?

I want to talk to General Ripper.

They're coming in now.

Naturally I am, sir.

Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---

Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.

No, they wouldn't send us in with bombs on an exercise.

Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.

Roger. One-three-eight.

Lothar, take your checks now.

They must have clobbered some of our cities already!

Forget it, Quentin.  It can happen to the best of us.  Now let's get squared away.

Maximum ECM!

Primary arming switch.

Listen, I think I'm hit bad.

Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.

Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.

Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.

First safety.

Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.

Recall what mistake?

Like hell it does.

You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.

Sorry, King.

It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?

Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.

But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.

I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.

But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?

Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!

Knock yourself out.

Sure, all the time, in Group.

Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.

Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.

Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.

Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.

No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.

He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...

Yes!

Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!

Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!

No, I mean, no one.

Uh, last night...

No, no.

Buff, can you listen to me for a second?

Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?

Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.

Look.

Look, Tim confessed to me last night.

Guess not.

I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.

Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"? Been on the road opening for "Midnight Hore". Stadiums, man.  Wait, so Pony's coming by here?

So, how was the ride, kids?

Buff is funny. God.

I will.

We're your customers. We're not complaining.

Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!

Oh, you were there?

Oh, thanks. Thanks.

Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.

Don't drop the guitar, man.

"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.

I could.

I'll be in the car, okay?

Okay.

He is?

He is.

Really?

What was your name again?

It's nice to do a lot of things.

I'm not a nice guy.

No, no, see, you, you don't understand.

Taking care of business.

Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.

We were?

Funny shit, man.

It does look good.

Thank you.

Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?

Ask your girlfriend.

I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.

That chick, Erica?

Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...

Wow. You did that for me?

Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.

Oh, shit.

Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?

I don't know.

That's right.

Nazeer Chaudry!

I don't know. I think she's breathing.

I hate that.

No.

It's a piece.

I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.

Hey!

But do you stand for anything?

You know, all you know is what's good for you.

Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.

Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.

Sooze.

Mm-hm.

You do.

No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.

And I fig- and I figured something out.

No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.

Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.

Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.

Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...

Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.

Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?

What?

Yeah, really.

I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.

Burnfield. No place like it.

Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?

Oh, yeah?

I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.

I get final approval. It's in my contract.

Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.

Yeah.

Oh, no, man. I can't.

No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...

You do?

I think I gotta go.

Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.

Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.

It's none of my business?

Don't do that.

If you hit me...

It's not the air force anymore, Scuff

Don't swear it's impolite.

It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!

My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?

Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.

Of course - of course!  Hands in...

Yeah.

Y'think?

But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.

Mmm-hmmm...

That was gas, Sweetie.

Uh, "no"... You're not fat.

Stop, you're gonna make me cry.

Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?

That you?

I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board?  It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

That's okay, Hannah.  It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies.  Sex - you can learn from movies.  But robberies?  There's no way.

Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.

All of you!

Now how the hell can I help you?

Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...

Stop it!  This is crazy!

Let it ride for a while.

Close, but no cigar.

I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?

I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.

Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.

Sure.  Bases Loaded.

Thanks.

Dark Windows.  How did you like it?

The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.

I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.

Phillip, you're mad!

Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...

I'll make it short.

I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.

Nobody can be that busy.

Honest to goodness, I hate you.

Don't you sometimes hate yourself?

Second generation, huh?

Twenty-two.

It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.

I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?

No.

Come on, Joe.

If you love me, Joe.

Hello, Mr. deMille.

Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.

Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.

I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.

But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.

It is not.  Get out.

Get out!

Fair enough.

Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.

Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.

Are you married, Mr.  -- ?

Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.

I'll take care of that.

Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.

It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!

I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.

Just follow me.

There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.

"Mad about the boy."

Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?

What kind of a silly thing was that to do?

DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.

I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.

You're a darling.

Good night.

I went for a walk.

Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.

It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.

These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?

You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.

I'm not here.

It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.

I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.

It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.  I could have gone on witn my career, only I found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me.  You see, I was her rirst husband.

More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.

Along is no good.  I need it now.

Maybe what you need is another agent.

You know better than to interrupt me.

Who?

Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!

This is the staircase of the palace.

But the phantom Zone is for criminals.

What is it?

But which one?

Sorry, mistress.

No, a super girl.

I've been saving it. For the right moment.

No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.

It's a warning, that's for sure.

Yes. It reminds me of home.

It's paradise . We could be very happy here.

Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.

But I don't understand.

It seemed that way to me.

Hmmm?

I did.

And you think you're in love.

This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.

Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.

You vicious--

Supergirl?

Well...I guess I can't.

That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.

I've got things to do.

Can I quote you?

Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.

Oh, no thanks.

Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?

-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?

How do you know?

Did anybody notice you?

Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.

You're not...an orphan are you?

Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.

Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.

Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.

I'm Linda Lee.

I'd love to.

What? Me?

It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.

You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.

You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.

It's the most beautiful place in the universe.

It's everywhere. But water is always the door.

Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?

What? Palace? Hardly.

Going to try. Didn't say I could.

Too late. Too late. Save yourself.

Buddy, are we in trouble.

Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.

Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?

There's no vodka in it.

Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.

But all he had was chocolate milk.

Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.

There's a lot of choices here.

Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.

They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!

I know, I'm the fault.

That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.

One.  And a half.

Yeah. A raise . .

Yeah? What do you do with 'em?

Or socks.

Decaffeinated too?

I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!

You designed it?

What will it get me?

Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...

Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.

Can't wait, pal, can't wait.

Join the party, genius! Come on up!

Watch out for them air pockets!

I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?

And do what?

Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.

I didn't have my camera with me.

Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.

I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.

Why do I have to do this?

Where's the handle?

My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.

He's bound to slip up sooner or later.

Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.

Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.

Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.

I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!

When was the last time you heard me sneeze?

Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.

Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."

That's because you can hardly see through those things.

What??

I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.

But what can you do? There's no way now . . .

He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.

Oh, hi.

Never closed my eyes.

I'm sorry.

Lois, I really don't see why --

Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --

You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.

So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.

Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.

Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?

Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?

I asked the right question.

I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.

North.

What do you want?

Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.

Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --

He ran in fear from us . . .

Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .

Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .

Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?

Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.

Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.

Sentimental idiot.

Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!

Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.

No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.

Clark. . . !

No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.

I'm not so sure you do.

That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?

I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.

And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?

I'm sorry.

Mr. White, come with me I want to see

Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!

Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?

Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.

Superman gets mail here?

Our other dinner guest.

A toupee that flies?

But why the hair?

Get the box, nephew.

Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .

There!

He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.

Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.

This wasn't in the plan.

I made you, and I can destroy you.

First, I have fun.

What do you fear?

Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.

High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.

Albert!

Lois isn't here?

North. It's north

Not really, no.

But otherwise it's swell.

Unbelievable.

He may have a gun!

Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.

I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.

You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?

Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.

Screaming

Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.

Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.

What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?

Fifty degrees below and still falling.

Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?

Ready.

But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --

Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!

Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.

Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.

I'm wearing it.

It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.

All of us.

He sure as heck does that.

Folks'll ask question.

What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.

Twenty-four.

Not a chance. It's too nice a night.

Right on the first guess.

Only when somebody shoots them at me.

Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!

Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.

Oh, Mr. Luthor...

I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.

--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...

You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.

I'm fine.  Still working with my father.

He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.

I'd heard that.  But she's well?

And Zoe?  How's Zoe?

She didn't.

Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?

It turns to steaming piss.

That's okay.

I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.

No you don't.

The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.

Why are you telling me this?

Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...

Why?

I'm not sure.

Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...

That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.

No.  It should be dry by now.

Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.

Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...

You talked about it?

Berry-picking.

Were his parents...attentive to him?

Did they give him special care?

What's that, Dolores?

Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling?

Why would he be frightened?

I didn't say that.

I'll just strap it on the roof.

Isn't it a lovely day?

We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?

No.  What's this lawyer business?

Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?

So he was mean?

The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.

So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?

She...she was a friend of mine.

Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.

What do they do?

No.

Tell me about it.

Almost three.

No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.

Yes.

I need money.

You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?

Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.

Well, let's see what we get.

Who are you?

No.

You've been retained?

It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.

Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.

No.

Do you have this agreement with you?

Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?

You remember that much?

Yes.

Before the actual accident?

Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.

I told you I was positive.  The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.

No.

I was scared.  And there wasn't time.

No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.

I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.

You mean it?

Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.

Nothing.

Nothing.

I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?

Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?

Don't apologize for me, Frank!

Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!

Your nephew doesn't want a drink.

See my mother?

Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.

Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.

I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...

I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...

Why?

No, I'm not.  I'm not!

I'm taking up the situation with you now...

A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake.  Let me have Billy Van Cleve...  Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings...  Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about that boy?  What boy?  Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!...  No, don't explain your point of view, but...

Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...

Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.

She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.

I don't believe it.

I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.

Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.

Not just this minute, J.J....

I didn't say that, J.J.

Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.

Sure you can if you want to, and I know you'll want to...  By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney?

J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...

You're incapable of the truth...

Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.

That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...

One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.

Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.

What sort of thing?

The renting agent and the tailor.

It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?

Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...

I know you do, Sidney.

Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.

It is a favor, isn't it?

Temple, I caught your act the other night and -

I wasn't looking for a brawl.  I came to bring him a present.  Wanna bite to eat?

But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.

Yeah.  A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week!  This is my press agent, Joan.

If the stores are open -

Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...

Now listen to me very carefully.

No one must follow your work.

My mission is to protect you.

You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.

Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!

That is one of my mission parameters.

Why?

A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.

No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.

No.

Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.

She intends to change the future somehow.

Remember what I said, you can't...

What?

Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.

Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.

Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?

Go!  I'll finish here.

SHOOT!!!!

Open the goddamn door!

Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.

Unknown.

Then what?

Son of a bitch, I knew it!

I'm sure it feels very real to you --

On all what?

That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!

I don't know.

You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.

Some.

Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.

The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.

I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.

Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.

Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday?

and totally irrelevant.

There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.

Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.

What is this, Emmi?

If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?

That is correct.

I don't buy that.

I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...

I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.

I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.

Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.

Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?

And what happened to Von der Nul?

This is absolute nonsense!

You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?

Those attitudes do not exist in me.

Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.

I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?

That's what I asked.

Helmuth.

So. You wanted to see me.

All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?

I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.

You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 

Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...

Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.

Yeah?

The Miracle Kid.

But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.

Yes.

Absolutely not.

Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?

It's not brain surgery, Chuck.

All.

Yes.  Don't hurt me.

Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.

I don't understand...

John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...

It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.

And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?

Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.

Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.

Good fighters.

You're not supposed to.

Yes.

Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...

Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.

I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?

I guess so.  You're a doctor?

I can't sleep.

Okay.

Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--

I just called.

Shut up.

Projections were far too optimistic.

The stock will turn.

There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.

You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.

Then, you kiss his ass.

I apologized, I offered to help.

Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.

Don't just stand there, get help!

He's turning blue!

What <u>is</u> your problem?

Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.

You should be.

If there was one.

You first.

No.

What's C.R.S.?

Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!

That tall, bright building.  Near there.

If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.

Come here...

I thought...

God, wake up, it's a con!

I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.

Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember?  I was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game.

What are you talking about... ?

I didn't say anything.

I'm back from the dead.

Nicholas...

You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?

We searched the house.

I saw them kill him!

Stop talking to them!

You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.

That's not true...

Stop it!

Where are you going in such a hurry?

What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?

Big family... small?

Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.

No.

I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.

I said I would...

Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.

You dodged a bullet.

No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...

Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?

Stop this.  It's not true...

Yes, very lucky.

Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?

You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.

I'll call.  I really will.

A game?

Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".

You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.

I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.

Like, this way... sort of...

I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.

Fine.

There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.

Goodnight.  Where was she?

It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...

Look, where is he?!

Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...

A Mister... Seymour Butts.

Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...

Don't ask.

Follow me.

Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?

Attempted murder.

Who's Watts?

Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.

Why?

Go ahead.

You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?

You want company?

Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.

You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.

I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?

It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?

Nell.  You will come here now.

My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her.

Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.

How'd I know it was for you?

Good morning, Theo.  Luke.

I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.

Nell, what do we do?

That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?

Why'd she kill herself?

I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.

I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?

Yes.  I've missed it.

You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.

Well?

I don't know, you know...

Like you.

I'm sorry.

Sure.

We all did.

All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.

Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.

Not bad.

Okay.

Round about, yeah.

It was better than a telegram.

Did Jenny know?

Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.

Not me, man.

It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?

Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.

<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.

I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.

Again?

Uh-huh.

Probably.

Really.

You look alike.

Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?

Yeah, well, she started all that in London.

Yesterday.  Afternoon.

Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.

Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.

He give me your address.

Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.

Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --

My employer.

This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.

Why not.

What do you think.

Depends, don' it.

A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.

Did you.  What was that in aid of?

Get seven years, did you?

Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.

What about your grandmother?

He alive to see this?

Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.

Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.

Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.

I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.

Nine years?  Is that legal?

But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.

Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.

So what.

There's more than a measly few grand in this.

Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.

I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.

What are you doing here?

Since when?

No trouble.

Susan.

-- You know his name is Frank.

I don't.

We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed.

I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.

Boy.

Birdy--

Well? How'd she do?

No. I--tell me--

What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?

Ed.

Yeah.

Uh-huh.

And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--

All right, I guess.

What is it, Dave?

The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.

Mm.

But it's...

I, uh...

Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.

Congratulations, Gina.

You don't have to tell me anything.

And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...

Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...

Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?

Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.

Sorry, I just didn't remember.

Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...

Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?

Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.

What the--

What the hell are you talking about?

Huh? No.

They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.

Hello, Walter.

Crane. Ed Crane.

I'm in.

The claws are sharp... I must have cut myself.  Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe.

What's the combination?

Hurry up!

Whose footprints?

Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.

No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.

If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.

I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.

Got my hands full here.

You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.

All right everybody, hold up!

Dr. John Whittlesley.

I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.

We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.

You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.

I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.

You're right.

So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.

It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!

And failed.  These doors are solid steel.

I wouldn't be so sure.

Yes, I do.

Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.

What is it?

The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.

Holy mother, what is that?

He's right.  Follow me.

Another storage room.

Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.

What's that?

It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.

Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.

Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!

You have time to talk?

Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?

No.  I think I'm hallucinating.

Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.

I think... it means it's full.

I think... for the pleasure of the kill.

Oh God!  Help!

I can't!

Today.

No, hold back...

What's to see?

All prop cars accounted for?

Why would we--

What music?

Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.

But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?

Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.

No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.

All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.

You're the star.

Because his mother got sick - very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.

Guess I always thought they'd adopt.

Oh, yes.

If we don't go now, it won't happen.

Sorry, I'm way behind.

Your Dad?!

Who?

How about them?

I told you I can't.

This is where it started.

Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.

Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.

I'm sure they're just exaggerating.

When you get to Fiji?

Fine.  I'll tell her.

Who?

Were you there--how do you know?

You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?

You're not FBI agents.

Does what?

Sorry. Don't have one.

You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.

When was that?

You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.

Me?

Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.

You got some kind of business with him?

Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.

Yeah, I did.

I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.

Before the bomb went off?

Not according to the men in blue.

They want to discredit you -- for what?

I'm not sure. A virus --

Your guess?

Yeah, well I don't have them all.

Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.

You're looking for a bomb.

What happened to playing a hunch?

How's that?

What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.

Scully, I found the bomb.

They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.

Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.

They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.

There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.

I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.

Get dressed, Scully.

Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.

According to this tag.

There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.

I'd been told as much.

I don't know why I think they went right.

This is great. This is fitting.

They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.

What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?

I don't know.

Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.

Just like that --

I think... something stung me.

Something's wrong...  I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm...

I think you're in anaphylactic shock --

Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.

She was with me.

And they want to blame us?

A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.

The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.

Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.

What alien environment?

I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.

Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.

Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.

I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.

If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.

Yes mother.

A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?

No.  No.

Give a kiss to Edward.

You don't know the procedure.

What difference does it make...?

You're sure of that?

Like hell "wait."

Yep.  Eloped.

It doesn't matter...

No problem.

Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.

I think that's the whole point.

Sometime yesterday morning.

Prevacid.  For my stomach.

Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.

It's his dog.

Considering where I've been...

They think you did it.

I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.

I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.

He has a little dog.

Whiskey.

Need we go through it all again?

Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.

Anna.

If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.

I thought you wanted...

We're both in it, Harry.

Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.

Oh...

His.

Thank you.

We loved each other, do you mean that?

It wasn't important.

It's true then?

This is forgery. It is very clever.

Can I have that woman's passport?

Martins.

No.

When did you see him last?

I can't say that I have.

No.

What?

Best thing that ever happened...

Calloway.

Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.

Bring him in.

It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.

Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?

Of course.

No, I don't know...

Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...

I know a very good dentist.

No, a major, were you really?

It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.

What about?

Of course, of course, of course.

Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.

You can help her.

Coffee.

At the end of every chapter --

What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?

Mr. Lime's.  Accident...

Yes, sir.

und ich kann nicht alle kennen.

What's he saying?

Why didn't they bring him in the house?

Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?

You don't mean that doctor?

Funny?

Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.

Not when I get interested.

Why no, Mr. Martins.

Okay.

Yes?

Traveler.

I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.

Good morning.

One or two kilometers.

Why?

It's on an island that no one get to.

Eh - bonsoir.

One night I will get the perfect photograph.

Richard, you know something -

Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.

What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.

The Zionists aren't Nazis.

They sound like you.

What??

Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --

I don't, but...

You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.

Disease? What disease?

They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.

He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.

That's stupid. Why would they?

Oh, really?

Then how come you're talking to me?

What assholes.

Even though his dick is so big?

Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.

About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....

I told you, I'm good at this.

Do they?

Lina, come here!

Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.

I'm stealing it.

No, but deep down, beneath the "tolerance" they learn on television, nothing's changed. The very word makes their skin crawl.  It isn't even hate, really. It's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor. We want to step on it. Crush it. We don't even know why. It's a physical reaction. Everyone feels it.

How would you kill him?

No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?

In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?

A poison...?

Sexuality??? What do you mean?

Notice? Like what...?

I don't know. Is that right?

So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.

Are all Jews the same?

I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.

I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.

There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.

You do it on the inside....

...I want you to do it on the outside, too.

You mean Ilio Manzetti?

Fine.

Lina... It's happening. Tonight.

I've got to get back to the --

The mother.

Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs.  A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.

I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.

I'm not hungry.... Come on, let's drive around.... We don't want to be spotted here.

Keep driving. Don't slow down.

Who even knew?

So what do we do with the device?

I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.

I didn't. I told you, I can't --

Dennis Leary.

Obviously.

Funny?

Valentine...

What?

As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...

Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?

Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.

I can't... I just don't know how to...

Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.

Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.

... So am I.

What d'you mean?

Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!

Yes.

It's the Free Diving World Championship.  I am by the way world champion!

What was he like, when he was little?

Yes, the Mamma is is there.

No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!

Enzo!

Enzo, why do you guys do this?

You know what I'm talking about.

No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.

That idiot!

Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.

You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!

I didn't say...  Brussels!

Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?

Great!

What room have you got?

Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!

People say that?

Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.

... For the mermaids.

Look at me.  These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks.  How long can you hold your breath?

No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.

I don't want to erase anything.

... Yes.

I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.

Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?

Well that's very nice of you.

... I was right about what?

Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.

I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?

You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?

How do you know that?

Uh... Ah!  A story?

Absolutely positive.

Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?

I didn't dive.

You go back, I'll walk.

... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.

No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.

I brought Johana to meet you.

Well... here.

The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!

Louis, we were French!

... Sally?

Way past it.

Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.

I'll have to talk to the driver.

But... how is he going to breathe?

Coffee might be nice.

You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?

Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.

Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.

It's Esther.

I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.

Sure. Why not.

I said, do you come here often!?

No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...

I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.

When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?

Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.

...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.

Mazel Tov!

Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.

Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.

He's still working out some identity issues.

Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.

The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.

Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering?  Girls.

That's some cold shit.

No, it was the perfect level.

It's Friday.

I don't know -

I sleep it off.

Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.

Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.

That's the place: I remember - My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --

Rosita  I have wondered -

Hey  I'm over here.

Sure -- certainly - but what's that got to do with this?

It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.

A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!

Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?

If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.

I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?

It's better you don't know.

I couldn't rest - I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.

To know where that leopard went -  I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little freshwater college back East. I gave that up.

No - really, I can see them -- they're coming now - turn off the lights 

I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --

Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.

Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.

Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money  not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.

Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.

No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.

I thought - is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.

No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.

Maybe I want to feel badly.

Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.

If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.

You're positive of that, aren't you?

We will 

I know -- Teresa -

Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.

I work here, sir. Im here most of the time.

I dont know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.

Disney! How inter...

Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?

Perhaps I should come back when youre...

You do want me to keep the job, dont you, Mrs De Moraes?

Paul Lamont...?

Sorry?

You knew he had nothing to do with your brothers disappearance, didnt you?

...You-you spoke to him?

If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why dont you accuse me of killing my brother?

You dont say.

Good.

Why do I feel I neednt answer that?

Here we go again.

Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. Thats when he hit me, and told me hed killed my brother... You dont know what youve done, he said.  Were in deep trouble, he said. We, he said. We.  Wed both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...

I dont know. Everyones dead...

Yes. Im trying to reach a friend but I cant get through. The number is 01766 770 471.

A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly?

Croissants. Like that...

Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.

I dont smoke. If you could get to the point...

A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.

No. A poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.

I thought youd never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... Theres a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...

So who... Whos the man? Where is he?

Were both thinking the same thing, right?

Thats right. Wheres the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?

This is a bad line.

Yes... Good, good...

You... Fuck you!

What?

Just me...  Martins gone back to the Ambassador. Look...

Can I have the reception desk, please.

Should I?

Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. Its important.

Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldnt like to think Id kept you waiting for nothing.

Look Mrs Spitz... I dont know to whom Im indebted for the recommendation but... Im not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.

Then you should not have sought an explanation.

Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation?

I dont know what your problem is, but...

Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where theyre not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?

Youre making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guys not one of Friedmans...

Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt...

Yeah.

Good. You neednt worry about the Austrian anymore. Hes dead. Ill be in touch.

I know his work better than I know him.

Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.

Fucked-up fucking weird.

Who?  I dont know who the fuck youre talking about, sunshine.

Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldnt go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.

Dont tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.

Of course I am, it's just that...

So... pretend it's not a game.

Now?

Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?

How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!

What... what do you mean?

But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?

Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!

Tell me...

He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...

Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...

I want to stay with you...

Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...

I -- I don't understand...

I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!

You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!

Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?

Yes...

No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.

Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?

You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?

... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?

Performing a miracle.

Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.

Not unless you hear my confession.

Silence her!  Take her away...!

And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?

Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?

You think?

W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?

But... her army's so small now...

Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...

Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...

My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?

... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone.

If there was, I didn't see it...

I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.

20,000 gold crowns.

Yes... they were.

Everywhere.  Where is the food?

I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!

Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?

Yes, it's a miracle.

Perfectly.

Jeanne, look behind you.

Of course I do?  Bring them up!

It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?

I know, but that's not the way things happened...

Why not?  He has good teeth...

Don't swear...

What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!

No.

I might ask you the same question.

How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here?  "What are you doing to me, Jeanne?"

I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!

I don't understand.  What do you want from me?

Why not?

Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...

Yes... lots of things!

But... it didn't just get there by itself.

In His name??

Really?

What are you doing on the wall?

What for?

Yes, my lord.

There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.

Yes, it is.

He never says his name.

And what does he say to you?

Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.

I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!

Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!

Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.

Yes.

My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.

I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.

He'll be back before curfew.

What are you doing?

How will we sleep?

American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!

I'll be fine.

What?

Do they?

That makes a change.

We use what?

You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.

should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.

Yes, so did the Germans.

You're amazing, Jehuda.

So, what's the news?

I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.

God forbid!

No, I don't think so?

I am... I was a pianist.

In the attic.

Watch your feet!

Watch his hand

Baines is packing up?

Ohh the tag is broken.

Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys

Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would be.

Yes, it's unholy.

No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.

Someone died here. It's tapu.

On your property?

I'd like to make a swap.

Ada says you're doing well with the piano?

I don't want to learn.

I'm sorry, I can't do that.  I don't have the time.  Goodbye

She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled

Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY

Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....

On your piano, that is the swap.

Tomorrow.

Do I know any gigs?

Who told ya this guy was in here?

I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall. 

I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.

How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!

Here.

I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.

All of it.

What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.

Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.

Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.

Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?

He was a con man, wasn't he?

Shove off, Duff.

C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.

Does J.J. know how to use this thing?

He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.

And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.

What do ya mean?

I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.

He threatened to kill me.

Did he say he wouldn't?

All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.

Naw, I'd just blow it.

I also gotta win.

Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.

Five and call.

The name is Lonnegan.

You're more gutless than I thought.

Don't have much choice, do ya?

Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.

What for?  I haven't done anything.

Yes, a ticket to Chicago.

Think nothin' of it.

Sixty-five.

Yeh, sleepin'.

No.  What's wrong with the front?

What the hell for?

You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.

What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.

Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.

He cheats.

This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.

I'm in.

Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring.

We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion.  Counterfeiting, anything you want.

All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.

With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.

On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.

We missed him.

There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.

Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.

Never heard of the place.

Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.

Yeh, but I don't know where he is.

What the hell good is Hooker to ya?

He'll never do it.

You know how they are... sex...

I'm sorry.

It's all right.

He's just around the corner.

Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.

Said he stole his invention.

Nothing.

Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.

Go!

Give it to me.

I didn't.

It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.

Thanks...  we're taking your cab.

Yes.

Yes.

Disappeared!

Yes.

What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?

Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?

Which way did she fall?

A new invention?

We were planning to be married right after Christmas.

Only in bad weather.

Better get home before it is.

He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.

She could tell you where father is.

What's he want of you?

I'm asking you.

No.

Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.

Who's your candidate?

They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.

Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...

You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?

When was that?

Did you go?

Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?

Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.

Why yes.

Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.

Want to take a poke at him?

You don't think I had anything to do with it?

How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.

Never mind.

He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.

What bonds?

Good.

You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!

No word at all?

He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.

Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.

I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.

Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.

He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.

What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?

I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.

Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....

She don't say she is, but I figure she is -

Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.

That last Martini.

We need ice.

I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it.

What are you drinking?

Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.

They were kidding you.

Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.

Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.

Breakfast.

All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?

That's not true.  He never came near my tabloids.  That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.

I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.

Yes.

It's not going to hurt me to get up.

Looks like a hold-up!

He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.

I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.

I did find him!

He was down in the shop.

I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.

Mimi...

I don't know.

Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.

Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.

Police!

No... no.

You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?

I know I left them there.

I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!

Home!

I'm fired.

You did.

Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.

There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.

We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!

Low on gas.  Got to refill.

Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.

Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.

He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.

Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.

The soldiers are going to kill those people!

What am I supposed to do?

Then get up and do something about it.

I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.

Why'd he come in our camp.

He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.

Suppose I don't go for that?

If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.

If I give it to you, will you let us go?

Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.

Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.

Wh-what do you think--

I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!

Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.

Epps...

You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!

It's the treasure, that's what it is.

Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.

What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?

Just stay down.

Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.

I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.

What?

Forget Wes.

We'll lie.

I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.

Is it all right if I stand up?

Sure.

Damn.

You sure you want me too?

Don't you touch it.

The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.

Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.

Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone that far north.  It's got to be Saudi. Come on.

They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.

I just said I would.  I don't think I--

I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.

Shi'ites, I think.

With what?  Against how many?

You come up with a better plan, let me know.

The...the gold...

When did you make the switch?

A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.

You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.

Thanks.

Thought you were going to buy a car.

What?

I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.

I'm saying don't do it accidently.

I thought it would be good to know.

For real?  A treasure?

What?

Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.

You know what, Wes?  If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.

What?

It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.

Yes!

Oh, no.

Oh, God!

Yeah, well, we're not.

Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.

Until we're out of the mine field is how long.

We have to do something.

Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.

Just seems weird they didn't chase us.

Lines up with the map and the photos.

Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?

Violation?

No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.

Eat your dinner.

I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.

He wants me to come to his quarters.

Don't go.

I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.

What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.

But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.

What?

I don't know.

AH UGH.

They don't know.

No one can see us now we're alone.

Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.

Incredible!

What?

Where is LUH?

Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.

When?.....How?

Look!

No!....

Soon he'll be a plastic cube.

Yes...

Yes...

Where are they?

Thanks.

We can start in the area where the robbery occurred.

That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.

Cream of the crop, huh? You?

Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.

One shuts it down, one turns arms it.

What?

Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.

Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.

Nothing.

Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.

Don't touch that.

Stay to your left.

That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...

When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.

Call upstairs, see what you can find out.

T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.

A bowling alley.

Who is he?

Alex-

And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.

What kind of bomb was it?

Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.

Look who's talking, old man.

Report on the case so far.

I know.

And it had diamonds in the back.

Yes, M'sieu Laval?

Well, he knocked at the door. You see, I was expecting two--uh--two business associates.

So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.

I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...

Constantinople?

The type they marry.

If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?

Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!

Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.

Yes, Baron. Thank you. 

Um-hum!

Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?

What is it?

Good day, Doctor.

The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!

The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!

I would like to.

And take the twenty thousand francs ...

Sweetheart, what day is today?

Seven and nine!

Ah!

He recognized you!

That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--

Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?

Lily-- 

Yes.

Yes.

I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.

But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.

Oh! You didn't read it!

M'sieu Laval!

Do you realize I have light eyes?

As you like. 

Too happy. That's why I discharged her.

Correct!  Good night.

M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...

I know all your tricks.

I know it.

<u>Adolph</u>?

Yes, Madame Colet?

Yes--uh--

I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- 

I know!

How much is your salary?

Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words! 

Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...

Thank you, Rose.

The ship will sink.

Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.

Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.

You are, Lewis.  You rolling?

A hundred and one next month.

Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.

Don't drop it Rose.

Don't you mean work me?

We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.

Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.

Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?

I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.

That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.

Not the better half.

I'd rather be his whore than your wife.

You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!!  Capito?? I go to America!!

Bollocks.

They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.

Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!

I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.

It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.

Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.

Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.

Jack.

Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.

Yes, exactly!

Just some sketches.

I see you.

You wouldn'ta jumped.

Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

Just move with me. Don't think.

A mistake?

I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.

He does landscapes.

Au contraire, mon cher.

It's okay. I'm alright.

Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?

I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.

It's so cold.

And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.

If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.

Charmed, I'm sure.

Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.

Do you want the truth, Anya?

Sure!

I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?

--and I can tell you where to get off.

We'll save you a place at our table.

I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.

No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?

Not at all.

And me coming in with two pair-- 

That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?

Fine--I'll be glad to.

Sure!  Excuse me.

I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>

Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.

Good-by.

You're not very ambitious, are you?

Never eat before the show.

Very--your mother?

Okay.

A lot of things I'd like to forget.

Sally--!

I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?

What do you know about them?

Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?

Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?

She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 

Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.

You take some awful chances.

Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.

What is it?

Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.

Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?

I wouldn't be surprised--

Why?

I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.

Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.

Sure.

June? That's my wife's name.

Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.

Oh,--we're doing about thirty--

I thought I put you to bed.

<U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?

Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.

Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?

You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--

Like it?

Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.

Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--

No--not much--excepting-- 

No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.

<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.

Meaning what?

Somebody's got to do it--

Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?

What's he got that I haven't got?

So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.

Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!

Good-night, folks.

Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.

You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.

I've lost my taste for knickknacks--

Why?

Good night!

Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?

Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.

Sure, Sis.

What!--are you crazy?

Isn't that a daisy?

Beauty, ain't he?

Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!

Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.

And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.

This brand.

Well... 'bye.

My fight's not with you, Holliday.

Say when.

I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.

But who was the Devil?

Ignore her?

I'll remember you said that.

I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.

What does he want?  He wants revenge.

That's great coming from you.

What?

I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.

Sorry...

Awful lot of money.

Good God, you're really-

Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.

What about her?

How would you know?

You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?

I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.

Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.

I didn't mean it that way.

I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.

All right, well, good night.

You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?

That what you got me up here for?

I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back

No?  Brothers to the bone, right?

They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.

Might as well hear him out. Anyways, what choice we got?  But no matter what happens, see It through to the end.  If you don't I'll curse the day I ever laid eyes on you.

Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.

Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.

Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.

Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.

I know.  And nobody can make him.

That didn't sound like thunder.

Morg, use your head.

Easy Morg, don't think about that now.

Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.

Jack...

Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels.  Want to thank you For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.

Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.

They're carrying guns in town.

Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.

I'm sorry.

I appreciate your time -

No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.

Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.

That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.

That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.

Is this another one of your games?

No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -

He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!

Political considerations?

Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.

I envy your 'undercover' assignments.

Hell. The CIA built that club.

Interesting video tape.

Depends what number you write.

- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.

Think about mom.

Thank you.  "Now hear this: Drop dead."

What do you mean?

You insist on calling all the shots.  And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.

Of course.  Minister Johnstone.

'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.

It seems, 007, we've received a tip

Of course.

Good luck on your mission, 007.

I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?

Stop it!

We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?

I am. What do you want?

Forget it. No way. I got here first.

Captain Morton.

Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?

Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.

Excellent.

What's wrong?

- I told you! He was there! -

...I see.

Fueled and waiting.

Thank you sir! Thank you!

Maybe. Maybe not.

Since when?

You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.

Maybe I can get down there next week.

I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea.

I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...

Why in the h...

Well, you look better than you did yesterday.

I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.

Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.

Hush.

It would be nice.

I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.

No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.

You stay inside. I will see to them.

I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.

Well, I would appreciate that.

Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.

Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.

I'll be right there.

He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.

Let me get you a cup?

Good afternoon to you.

You must have done something to her.

Wasn't Hocker lynched?

That's nice.

Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there.

I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.

Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.

"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."

Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.

I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.

He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.

Don't shout!

I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.

Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.

Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.

I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.

Bye, house.

I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.

Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?

I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.

It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!

I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?

Excuse me.

But we're not on my planet, are we?

Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!

This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!

Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!

Don't tell me what to do!

Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.

We've got to get out of here...NOW.

Woody!  The rocket!

Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!

Sorry there, old Spudhead.

Miss.  G-6.

She's sick!

Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.

She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!

Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --

Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?

He tortures toys -- just for fun.

Alright!  That's it!

No, I'm not!  Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.

You murdering dog!

Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!

I was close to being scared that time.

Yes!  Yes!  We promise!

Yes SIR!

This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!

I can't quite make out -- 

You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.

I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.

So had I.

Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.

Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.

Well, I hope it stays that way.

He never came home last night.  Was he with you?

Why are you talking like that?

I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.

Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.

I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.

I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.

That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.

I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.

It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?

Carl, that's insane.

Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?

Barbara --

Just watching you.

Yes.

I'm third in my class.

I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.

What is this, like freebase?

Then here's a little bump.

I feel good.

It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's quick.  Why do women wear makeup and perfume?

So does half of San Diego.

Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.

You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.

Medicinal marijuana initiative.  Or am I being cynical?

Not Tiger Woods.

There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.

Nobody said shit, Eduardo --

I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --

That thought makes me feel awful.

You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.

But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.

We keep our mouths shut.

Where?

Javier Rodriguez.

Everybody has a weakness.

If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.

Any idea how much?

We sometimes went downtown to score.

I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.

It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.

Can you not go yourself.

Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.

Jesus.

Did you bring the cards?

Thanks.

I'm going home.

think I left something back at the -

Shut up.

Out.

Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?

Smells like it.

Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.

He forgot. Useless motherfucker.

Eh? How's that?

Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.

Sorry about last night -

It's no problem.

I'd really rather take care of it myself.

No.

No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.

Cheers.

Another dab?

Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.

But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.

OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?

What's wrong, Allison?

He made me lick it.

And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.

When are you going to visit him?

You're all hear.

Fuck you.

Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.

Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.

To see you through the night that lies ahead.

Your favourite dish.

In that case --

As you wish.

Yeah.

Such as?

Are you serious?

It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?

No joy yet.

What?

No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.

Magnificent. You are the first to find me.

Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!

Is there a problem, gentlemen?

Pavel.

A Federation starship.

Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?

Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.

Understood. Kirk out.

The power was within you.

Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.

If we could send a distress signal...

Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.

Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?

Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.

Because it's there.

I don't understand.

That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?

Goodnight, Doctor.

Yes.

Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.

I cannot be certain.

He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.

That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.

Captain, what have I done -

You ordered me to kill my brother.

I have a half brother.

He did have pointed ears.

Welcome aboard, Captain.

Not possible. You were never alone.

You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?

Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-

I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?



Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.

Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.

I hide no pain.

Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.

This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...

"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.

You invented Space Paranoids?

I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.

Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...

Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set

Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?

For being on to Dillinger.

Hello, Alan.

Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.

Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.

Not a chance.

I... have come to communicate with my User.

Hah.

Where did you hear that name?

No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.

I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.

You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.

A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...

Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really...

We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --

We have to talk.

Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.

Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...

Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.

You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?

We'll get them, sir... These things take time.

Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...

Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!

Simon?  Ohmygod.

It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.

Yeah, Dad.

I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...

Yeah, right.

Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?

Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.

You're kidding.

Roger, One.  Rolling.

Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.

She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.

Right.  She's only fourteen.

I thought you moved out.

Yeah, right.

Okay.  Here she comes.

That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal.

Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.

It can't be.  Not Helen.

It can't be.

Yeah, but for who?							*

What are you talking about?

The purse is still at the house.

... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--

Sorry.

No!  Never!

I'd like that.

And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.

It's okay, don't bother, Harry.

I can't, honey.  I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry.

Well, maybe a little.

Yeah.  I suppose he is.

Yes.

No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?

I'm not wearing any.

I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.

Yes.

What about Juno?

Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?

And you've got one.

Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?

What about the husbands?

Red hot.  Her thighs steam.

Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?

Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.

He said he was an American agent.

No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.

I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.

I'm sorry, I can't.

It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.

Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--

Use the gifts that Allah has given you.

This is great, we got cable.

Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?

Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.

Ya looked through it?

Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.

Want some Goobers?

You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.

Where are you from.

What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?

That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?

He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.

I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.

Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.

Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.

I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.

Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.

At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.

What?

What?

Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.

Cancoon.

I heard that.

With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?

Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.

I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.

That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.

You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.

I'm her husband.

Fuck you! My mother was Apache.

You got it.

Now tell him goodbye.

Every word of it.

I certainly hope so.

It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.

Elliot.

Where?

Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.

Let me handle this.

No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.

Really?

I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?

Want an animal cracker?

Look, Dick, I don't -

He trusts you?

I guess so. Follow me.

The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.

Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.

I bullshitted him.

Do you still have friends on the force?

Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?

Do tell. Why drug related?

That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?

Uh-huh.

What about him?

Where'd you come from?

Sure. No problem.

Absolutely.

Uh-huh.

I believe he believes him.

Or a supporting actor -

'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -

You do.

How's he supposed to see the wire?

Pussy love pink rocks.

Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.

Nigger, you lie like a big dog.

- Because it's good!

If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.

You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.

I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.

Do you know a Clarence Worley?

I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.

Uh, I didn't hear the...

We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.

Uh, what?

Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?

Meaning...???

It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.

This is April, right?

What year is it?

Perhaps it was a wrong number...

You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.

It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.

You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?

Clues?  What kind of clues?

I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.

James, why don't we...?

And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.

I thought you didn't know how to drive.

What's the matter with your leg?

I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.

We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.

I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...

...I had a dream about...something like that.

You... you left them a message?

Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.

So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.

No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, "voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.

I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!

How did you find me?

We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole.  Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.

Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?

That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?

James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?

I'll be right here...just in case.

You can't do that yourself?

I'm sorry, I didn't--

Christ no!

That's 'cause he's dead.

That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.

Same back at you.

Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself; is it worth it?

Will be.

I need a ticket.

Yep.

Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?

Just a car.

I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.

There you go, sweet talking me again.

What's it to you?

Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.

Yes.  Yes it is.

I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?

You didn't hear something?

There's someone in the house.

My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?

You sure you can manage?

Do you want me to carry your pack for you?

I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.

I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?

Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?

Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.

Thank you.

Come here.

Nothing like a little liveliness.

You know what I want.

If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.

Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.

I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?

Whatever it takes.

From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.

I can't.

You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?

I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--

If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .

Don't yell at me!

I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?

We're going all the way.  Together.

Wait.  What about . . . him?

Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.

You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!

Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.

You could give me the gun.

But you said we could be together.

Where the hell am I going to go?

You closed it, didn't you, Grace?

Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.

Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.

Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.

That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?

Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.

About things.  About your wife.

I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.

How do you put a price on murder?

Make it twenty.

You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.

You came to take my wife from me?

Liar.

That's a thick change of heart.

Come on, Jake--

Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?

You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.

Two-hundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder.

Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.

She's dead.

I've had time to get over it.

I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.

Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.

What the hell are you talking about?

You expect me to believe that?

Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.

You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.

No.  He gets shot by the old lady.

A hundred-forty-five really.

Yes, Mr. Vesci.

Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.

What happened?

Wouldn't know anything about it.

Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.

I don't understand what the--

Thirty-thousand dollars.

You want something?

I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?

See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.

No and I don't plan on sticking around either.

You know I won't be seeing you.

That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.

Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.

I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!

Yeah...

Darrell's a moron.

Ah, I can smell it on you.

I was hoping we could talk.

I do.

A man doesn't always mean the things he says.

And what does that make you?

You love her, but you hate her?

How do you want it?

Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.

I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.

Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...

I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.

Darrell--

Yeah, I can fix it.

Another accident?  You got to be more careful.

Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.

That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?

I don't have a goddamn credit card.

What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.

You've been there?

That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.

What?

I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.

What sign?

I want my car.

No! No police.

My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.

You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?

You should be more careful.

I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.

From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.

Those are white words, not ours.

Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.

How do you know he's still not here?

Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.

Try me.

I'm sorry...

Is it pretty?

You don't have any money put away, do you?

At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.

There is no us, remember?

Stop it.

No! You get it!

It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!

Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?

Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.

<u>I don't know why</u>!

I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?

But we all need that too. Hold him.

Can you make it back up?

Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.

Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!

No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.

...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.

Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--

The ticket is 30.55.

No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.

Sure, I'll try.

Oh?

...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!

Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...

Four.

The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.

Oh.

My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.

You use your sleeve.

Yes.

Jeremy what the hell are you doing?

Rust?

Think carefully?

It's finished. I won.

I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.

How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?

You thought he was carrying a knife?

You're skill.

Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort.

It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.

That's not what I witnessed David.

No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.

I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.

I want to sleep here tonight.

I won't make any noise.

What things?

All of it.

Know what?

Jeremy listen to what--

No.

How did you get together?

Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.

And what was that explanation?

I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.

Why?

What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?

Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.

Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.

Oh yeah.

Alive?

You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.

Property.

You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?

Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...

Yup.

Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.

What's your name?

Uh... yeah. Yeah.

Well, uh... it ain't loaded.

"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.

N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...

Uh... Duke.

Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.

He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.

Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?

Is... is it... loaded?

Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...

Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...

Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...

Oh.

I don't never see nobody anyhow.

No.

Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...

He ain't dead? You didn't get him?

After a ways.

Shut up, Kid.

Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.

Yeah.

H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...

Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.

Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?

You're gonna kill him, ain't you?

You sure you ain't armed?

Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?

Eleven.

Nor Quincy, I guess.

Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.

Whaddaya do, just use your hand?

Yeah.

Huh? Uh... yeah.

I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.

Best we move that pig.

I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.

Tom?

Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.

Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.

I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella.

We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?

He's blind, for Chri...

How many you killed, Kid?

He ain't as tough as you, Kid.

All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.

Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.

You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?

Yeah?

They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze

+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;

I'm having a stroke.

Goddamnit.

No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.

Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .

So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?

You are a criminal.

Dig.

Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.

McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.

What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?

Tough break.

Not if we do it my way.

Russian, I think. I don't know.

Just do what I tell you.

You know damn well, dead-man.

Who's your boss?

We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.

Neither do we.

Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.

I've got a ton of work and no good people.

I shivved him.

Business or personal?

Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.

Which is shit.

Waste of time.

If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?

I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.

Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -

Keaton was a piece of shit.

You know a religious guy named John Paul?

He didn't have my lawyer.

Right.

So why play into his hands? We can protect you.

Give a guy a break, huh?

Why didn't you say anything?

I don't know what you're talking about.

But Keaton...

I don't

Edie.

THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.

Yes.

As far as we know, nothing.

Yes.

Yes.  It would be.

Mickey told me to come back to work.

It looks that way.

Yes.

Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?

That's right.

Frank Galvin.  We've met before.

...to get her heartbeat back...?

No.

I know of him.

Through, through his book.

`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.

I am seventy-four years old.

I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.

I wouldn't do it.

I . . ..

I...

`They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?

You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.

It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ...

I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.

Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...

Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.

No, you did fine.

Yes...I...yes.

She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.

... Deborah Ann Kaye ...

I've got nothing to say to you.

Why is that?

That happens.

Ready, your Honor.

I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.

And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.

I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?

From the magazine?

How come you're calling me from...?

Still looking.

Laura.

What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?

And are they going to get it?

Isn't there something you...

You, you don't under...

What is that to you...?

I don't have a goddamned idea.

I have to talk to you.

Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...

One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...

... I get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --I get this expert doctor to talk to you.  I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  You're 'sposed to be in court.  I bet you haven't even seen the file.

I'm going to help her.

You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.

You got a good memory, Franky.

So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.

Oh shit, what's today?

I can't talk now.

D'you find the obstetric nurse?

...one of the other nurses?

The 'History'...?

The broad has disappeared...

But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...

You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.

... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.

... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...

I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...

In New York?

You saw Kat in New York...   ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?

Yes.

Thanks, Franky.

That's for sure, Frank.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?

Huh.  And why is that?

Yes.

The Big Boy did...?

Huh.

Me, too.

San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.

I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power...  the freedom.

No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.

No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?

All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...

I -- I --

-- and how you happen to be living here.

No, Judy, you don't understand.

Yes.

They're none of them right.

Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.

Ah, no!

Wherever you'd like...

No, Ernie's is fine.

Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!

I need you.

No!

You can't. You're afraid!

Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?

Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!

Some money.

Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.

Why?

This afternoon.

I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.

Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.

Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!

I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!

What?!

A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...

A grave...

I know.

Only this far.

But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...

There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.

No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!

Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  Madeleine, think of when you were here!

Let me go.

To the church, I must go there.

Carlotta Valdes?

What car?

Why?

Oh!

I've never run across one like that.

Normal.

You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.

Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.

He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.

Sorry, old man. Work.

I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.

How?

That!?!

Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!

Who?

Nothing to tell.

Who's the guy, who's the wife?

I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.

All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.

Oh?

By whom?

How soon can it be altered?

That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!

First of all...

You're interrupting a personal conversation.

Boyd brought up divorce statistics.

Multiple reasons.

Franco mother-fucking Harris!

You're not a team player.

Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.

I'm calling the ambulance.

Calling the ambulance.

Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?

We can do this. We can get her out of here.

I'm not wrecking the transmission!

According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.

I am not flexible on this.

We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.

Lighten up Adam. Show some character.

Any time fat boy!

Adam! Calm down.

What?

There is no candy!

What.

Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?

Well, oh...

Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...

I'm with Tina. Is she there?

Not tonight.

Left side.

Who's up for making some real money?

I can't.

I'm talking about prayer.

Shut up Boyd.

He's having a problem here.

I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.

I'm serious.

Oh really? Starbucks?

And what happens when you can't?

Not really, no.

We're not goosed.

How about my Fatburger?

All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?

It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.

What?

We missed the deadline.

Yup.

Why what?

Well it's bad timing.

I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.

What does Moore have to do with your growing?

You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.

It's vile!

I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!

I'm not. What's the problem?

Honey I don't have the time...

More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.

I will.

I'll see you tomorrow...

We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.

Now?

Are they fighting?

Can we just talk this out?

I won't even discuss it.

No it's not okay. It's not.

Do you love me?

The prostitute.

She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...

But...

What money?

What does that mean?

The only proof is those bodies.

You did all right dad.

What does that mean?

About what?

He's your brother.

At the newsstand on 3rd.

The wahoo?

No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.

Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?

That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.

That's what I'm thinking.

What song?

Oh I know that. How does it go...

...embarrassing, shameful...

Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.

Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.

You'll think you're still at the convent.

No. Mother Superior told me to come.

In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.

Come down.

Don't you ever see him?

No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.

Wasn't that cowardice?

It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...

Go away! Leave me alone.

Yes, sir. Good night.

Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.

And in the vegetable plot?

He was asking for it.

It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.

That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.

Why?

I know that you used to work with an architect.

I'm not like you, you have your wife.

Leave him alone.

I'll be ready.

You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.

I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!

Stop this!

Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?

I'm afraid.

You little liar! Get out of here!

Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.

Yes!

Mother.

I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.

I have a headache.

Oh, you slept well; don't worry.

You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe online, yet?

Where's my gun?

You sonofabitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?

You think he's smart?

I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?

Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?

If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.

Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?

I'm still making adjustments...

It's nanotechnology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...

This is supposed to be years away.

Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?

True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.

It was me, what?

What do you expect me to do, thank him?

No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?

I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.

What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?

It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.

It wasn't a lie.

Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.

Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.

He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.

Do me one favor  if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.

In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...

Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.

Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...

Stop me.

Both.

They're going to fry me for it, anyway.

You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?

I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?

I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.

Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...

Duck!

The only thing I want to hear is your silence.

Why's that?

Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.

My...secret.

As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.

At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?

Naw, we can't play this one catch-up.  That's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  We have to...

Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...

<u>Hello</u>.  What?

For Schumann.

It's <u>producing</u>.

I could tell you stories:  Cecil B. Demille:  Alright? The Greatest Show on Earth:  He needs an elephant,

They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.

I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?

Listen to what I've ... listen to... does anybody know Morse Code?

It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...

...twelve years.

Come on.

...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.

But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?

Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?

They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...

We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.

I'll see you at National.

....we landing?

Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...

The Ribbon Manufacturers.

...I just hope...

<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 

Knock on wood.

<u>I</u> dunno.... Ambassador to <u>Togo</u>, somethin', <u>I</u> dunno... he...

The War is Over.

Gloria -- sell the House.  

First of all, we're locked <u>in</u> to it, <u>secondly</u>:

No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 

No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...

How do we explain <u>that</u>?

I know who you are, Mr. Ames.

Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...

CAIN, MOUTHING ALONG, WITH THE SPEECH, SHE LOOKS DOWN, AND WE SEE WRITTEN, ON HER COPY. of his making 

CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.

ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%.  A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.

ON BREAN, WHO IS DOODLING.

BREAN, SHAKING HIS HEAD.  IN THE B.G., MOSS, DRINKING. THE TV COMES TO LIFE.

...what is this?

I'll play your silly game.

When's he coming back...?

Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.

...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.

The... 

I never won an Oscar.

Yes.  Indeed I did. 

...that's what it is.

I'm sure they do.

And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?

Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?

No, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.

...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...

It's not too <u>clean</u>...

Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...

We <u>were</u> the Albanian campaign, John -- <u>We Were There</u>.

Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.

Come on, Pal, come on Willie, come on, Old Shoe...

We'll deal with that when we come to it.  <u>This</u> is producing.  <u>This</u> is what they pay off on...come on, Pal, Boots and Saddles...

He raped a <u>Nun</u>...

That's <u>one</u> thing, but I'm not gonna let two dickheads from <u>Filmschool</u> take it... are you <u>Nuts</u>?  Are you <u>Nuts</u>?

Take ten.

Keep Talking....

...what is this?

It can't be a ribbon cause AIDS had a ribbon, cause the Yellow Ribbon thing had a ribbon, cause...

We had Davy Crockett hats, but you could <u>crush</u>'em ... you could <u>crush</u>'em, see, when you felt stupid. Crush'em, put em in your Pocket.  You can't put a Mountie hat in your...

Leopard Skin...

...they have the capacity to Meld into the <u>Woods</u>, and...

I'm just talking about the Hats.

...for the beans, yes...

Cause the beans, y'know, y'can tell if they're <u>puttin</u> stuff in it.

Come on, you fucking sissy, you think this is tough? Try show-business.  1970-1990, n'ybody I worked with, y'could of bottled their piss n'sold it in the <u>ghettos</u>...  Come on, Pal...

How 'bout a Cold Drink...?

What about tipping off Yurovich?

Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.

Please, no thanks... 

Oh really.

Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away...

Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.

...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping Rock any day.

Yeah, where's your machine gun.

Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.

Of course he's busy, and so am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking. I know that if he could only hear what I have to say... it would change his life.

Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...

All right, I owe you one Marv.

Anacott Steel. Buy it.

Then get out and close it behind you.

Get the hell out!

Now! Tell everyone to dump!

Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.

...Work okay?

About what?

Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.

... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?

Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.

I met them before you were born.

Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.

...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.

Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?

Nah, she asked the wrong question.

Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.

Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.

I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.

Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.

Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.

Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...

Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.

Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!

What? How do you know about my father?

My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.

Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.

How much?

A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.

Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.

I'm sorry, this can't wait.

Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.

I gather you're a decorator.

You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?

I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.

At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.

Why?

Any better and I'd be guilty.

...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.

There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.

You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.

You got it, G.G.

Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?

No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...

I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.

With Mark?

Businessman!

But he still has something Mark hasn't.

It's eleven forty-five let's go

Thank you

Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air

I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.

Who's is all this?

Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.

They're all human beings

I know he does.

So much.

What do you mean?

No.  But once I heard...

You're joking.

Mm-hmm.

Yes, but...

Isn't there something called group hysteria?

Um...

That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.

I've never even met you.

You do?

You know where she is?

You must have been very proud.

I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?

Jody, no...

...no...no...no...

Shhh.

I think so

It's alright.

No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.

I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.

If she was dangerous before--

I know.

What is it?

We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.

Fine.

You are...

Yup.

Tomorrow.

After that.

I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...

That's not what I'm sug--

Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.

What kind of whispering?

I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?

Well, that's nice.

And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--

No.  Look!  In the window.

It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!

Who did?  Mrs. Feur?

...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?

Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--

Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...

No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!

We had a seance.

Maybe you resent how busy I've been.

When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.

I...

What's wrong with me?

Since when?

DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!

Who?

It's alright.

I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--

:Well, they are.

Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!

I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.

With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.

Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.

When did she die...?

It wes a dream...!

Michael...  Help us...  The door!

FAST.

Nooo...  NO!  Stop!

I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!

Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...

I don't know what you are!!!

Tell me what I am, Rowan.

'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?

You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -

And whose houses do you design...?

He fools around with his patients too.

You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.

God knows, I'm intriguing.

Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -

I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.

Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.

Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!

I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.

And I thought I was the mindreader.

A little wine...?

No.    This is unreal...

That's not funny.

Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.

You can't just -

That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?

If you like that type.

Just don't fall off any ladders.

Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.

Is that a crack about our singing...?

Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.

I've decided not to open a practice here  I want to set up a research clinic.  For infant genetic disorder.

Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?

Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?

Yes it is...

I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.

No - not all the time - I mean

No - I've been abroad for a long time...

Sure...

I think I will pass...

Yes, one and a half please.

I'm a dentist

Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -

No she didn't...

You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 

I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came

Did you?

Nothing could be better...

I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...

I am sorry...

Yes - I suppose so...

He doesn't need to...

What was I supposed to do?

Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...

Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?

I had an accident - I fell down stairs...

I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...

I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...

Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright

Yeah, whatever.

Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.

It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.

...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.

I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--

Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.

Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.

We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.

Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.

Let me get this straight...

Yeah?

But that smile.

Do it?

You have changed since second grade.

Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...

We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.

Yeah.

I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.

Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?

You ordered a Winnebago?

I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.

I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.

Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.

What do you want me to do?

We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.

You mean they knew who I was?

Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!

She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.

So, what brings you here at his hour?

You want it in writing?

Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.

Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.

The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning exposé changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.

In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.

Then I'll write about YOU.

You never know around here.

And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.

He phoned it in.

The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.

A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.

I know.

In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.

Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...

I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.

My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.

Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.

You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.

You're quick. I like that.

You better.

Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.

What is all this? When are you coming home?

I'll make you very proud.

Like what?

Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.

Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"

Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.

Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.

Me? The King of Coitus?

Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...

I was like a different person tonight.

I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.

My parents always say hard work builds character.

In other words, our scope is too narrow.

Really? So I'm doing OK?

Seriously? I'm doing all right?

I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.

We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.

Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.

I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.

I... You know... I...

What about the blood?

Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...

He was large?

I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'

He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.

I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."

Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.

Ray thinks she was murdered.

Back to the land of grownups.

Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.

You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.

I net a guy in a bar.

You could say that.

Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...

You have someplace to be?

You don't think Sam could've put it there?

Ray, you heard him...

And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?

Did he come in with you?

I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...

You know what that will mean for Lombardo.

What about witnesses?

Just tell us what happened.

Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.

Yeah.  But I got my bike.

Lombardo ever come out here?

No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...

You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?

You're out of your mind.

Police -- God -- get a life.

I'm not on your property!

I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.

I won't.

In back of the garage.

Yes.

There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...

That's not your line.

Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.

Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.

About what?

Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?

Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?

Story's the same, Detective...

The one you bought at school.

Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.

Put Kelly on too.

We?

Hi, Sandy.

Can't.  Got a passenger.

To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.

So maybe I'm a one-woman man.

Jim West.

Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.

Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.

Aha?

Starting with a screw?

Prepare what?

It's a repeating steam cannon!

At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.

Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.

I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.

Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.

Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.

It's better than nothing.

You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?

Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...

Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!

Of course not.

Thank you.

What is this?  A whole new train?

I'm sure we will.

My Lord, he was telling the truth!

We'll see.

They don't even realize they should be frightened.

Really?

My... the wild west.

Would that include me?

This is Colonel Richards.

How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?

Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.

He thought you were a woman, Airk!

Least I'm not down there herding sheep!

Just get me some horses.

Yes...?

Me?

What is Tir Asleen?

Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.

Why not?

You're not a woman.

My step-father's going to tear you apart.

I'm not going to let this baby die.

I have no family.

He's no magician.

I will!  But I need help!

As above, so below.

Are you okay?

I don't know.

These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...

I will.

Where the hell did you come from?

Elora Danan!

You're crazy.  I think you're in love.

That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--

No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...

Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.

Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.

Who is he?

I can't see anything--she's too bright!

Good, you start tomorrow.

Sorry. It's important.

John, I don't understand any of this.

It's been a while.

Pretty much.

Yes, sir.

Pick up the hat.

No pistol. Ever.

...I want to say a thing.

I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!

Oh, he's good.

Maybe.

I hope you don't have any doubts about that.

Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.

Don't try me, Johnny!

We do not go into your courts.

Home.

The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.

Two days.

I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.

Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!

Johnny! Where the hell have you been?

Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.

He's got my number.

He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know  anybody who knows John  knows that's a goddamn lie!

Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.

We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!

I have done nothing against the ordnung.

I don't think she knows.

Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?

Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.

Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.

You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!

I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.

Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!

Is morally, ethic'ly

Do you presume to criticize the....

Who are you?

I don't believe you!

Oh ....

Hickory!

Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.

Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.

Whenever you wish.

Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.

Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.

Oh, no -- no!

But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.

Oh...

Well, you're perfect now.

I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.

Oh! Oh!

Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!

You've had plenty of time already!

Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.

Lions and tigers and bears!

Lions and tigers and bears!

Yes.

Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!

Not nobody, not nohow!

Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!

Did they hurtcha?

Ohhh --

Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.

Oh --

Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.

Oh --

Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!

You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.

What's the matter?

Now...

Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!

Yeah!

Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!

Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!

Hold still - hold still --

You don't neither --

Howdy, Miss Gulch.

You mean she bit you?

Oh, she bit her dog, eh?

Ohhhh -- it's me!

Ohhhhhh!

I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?

Ho -- ho --ho

It's a whozis?

We'll get you together!

You promised us real things -- a real...

Help!

Dont know any doctor jokes.

So who are you?

When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.

Its part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.

Elektra King.

Makes her look even more innocent.

Elektra would control it all.

If I dont get to the Boa before he gets to Maidens Tower, M is dead.

Shes not a girl anymore.

Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?

Your last chance. Give me the name.

I cant tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!

Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.

Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?

Funerals arent exactly memorable.

Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.

Youre not going to.

No. Youll be safe here.

Not at that price. Time to surrender.

You can drop the act, its over.

Five more turns and your neck will break.

He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.

It is my oil!  Mine and my familys!

She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?

You are out of your league.  Shes working with Renard.

To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.

Bond!

Could...could you come?

Please.

Is it?

Yes.  Au revoir...

The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.

Hello, Adrian.

Jon, no -- I can't --

I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.

Always.  Ever since the day I died.

I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .

I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!

You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.

The missing scientists.

Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?

Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.

Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?

No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.

Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!

Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.

Okay!

That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.

The costumes.  Am I right?

Where did he go?

Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.

Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?

What do you mean, frame-up?

Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.

We should get back --  What?

Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.

I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.

Maybe I'll do that.

Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.

Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.

The name's Gibbons. You were saying?

Looks like a diner.

Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.

You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.

You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.

I'm not interested. I've already got a job.

I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.

Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?

I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?

Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?

Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.

We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.

You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.

The scum of the Earth.

I've seen enough. Turn it off.

We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.

Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.

He gets to be the hero.

Yorgi asked me to.

Go to hell.

Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.

Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.

Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.

I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.

A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.

If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.

Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!

It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.

It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.

It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.

You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.

You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.

Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?

I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.

The corner. Anarchy 99.

Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.

He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.

When else are you gonna do it?

Of course.

This is a gift. From me to you.

What's "Anarchy 99"?

That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.

"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.

That's alright, I'm kinda tired.

You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.

Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.

Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.

I don't like him being here.

Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.

I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.

I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?

Sure you are, sport.

I won't light the cigars - how about that?

Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.

By reading my thoughts?

Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.

Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.

You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.

In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?

No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.

To find Rogue.

The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.

Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.

Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.

Victor Frankenstein.

From your office, sir.

Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.

Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?

Baack!

MMmmm.

MMmmm.

Yes, don't worry.

Yes.

Oh, nice.

You bet your boots it does.

Surprised!

Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.

No, of course not.  I just meant...

Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.

Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??

Does that include the key to the laboratory?

Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.

I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.

This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.

A week.  Ten days at most.

I beg your pardon?

Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.

Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.

But your grandfather's work, sir...

No, Fred ereck.

It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.

Why are you talking like that?

Wockers with the knockers???

Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.

No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.

Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.

Can you imagine that brain in this body?

He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.

If you like -- just hurry!

All right... elevate me!

This guy means business.

What?

What?

But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.

I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.

Who are you talking to?

I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.

careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.

What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.

What???

I'll bet it's a doozy.

... It's.

Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................

Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??

It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?

Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.

Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.

And look at this, Doctor!

This is not the finals -- just sing!

Good night!

Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!

What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.

There must have been someone else down here then.

Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.

Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.

Food!!

Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.

Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42

My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.

I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.

I'm explaining my reasons.

Right.  Bombardier, to me please.

I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
