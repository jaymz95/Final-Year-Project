Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.

No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---

The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.

I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.

You got something on your mind?

She's not a...

So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?

Wow

Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.

Neat...

Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.

You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.

You looked beautiful last night, you know.

Let go!

What if she never starts dating?

Daddy, I --

If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.

Wear the belly before you go.

Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --

That I'm used to.

He always have that shit-eating grin?

You know French?

You told me that part already.

Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.

You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.

And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.

Cameron, I'm a little busy

What 're you talking about?

Leave my sister alone.

Two legs, nice rack...

You need money to take a girl out

You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.

I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.

Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.

I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --

Nope - just came by to chat

The people at this school are so incredibly foul.

William didn't even go to high school

Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.

Have you seen him?

Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...

Why 're you doing this?

You don't care if I die

Why?

Like you could find one

Dorsey.

Kat! Wake up!

When you were gone last year -- where were you?

Who?

You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?

No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.

You tell me.

How'd you get a tux at the last minute?

It wasn't like that.

Was that your sister?

Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?

Hey there.  Tired of breathing?

Cool pictures.  You a fan?

I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.

That's where we can help you.  With Kat.

You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?

Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?

Ever been to Club Skunk?

So you got cozy with she who stings?

I missed you.

I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?

You're completely demented.

In the microwave.

What's a synonym for throbbing?

They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.

You say Asia can be found by sailing west?

Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.

The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...

He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?

You can see for yourself.

I'm not asking you to swear to anything.

Don Alonso de Bobadilla.

Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?

Father...

What are you listening to?

What does he say?

They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...

But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.

Chief says -- how many?

Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...

How did you manage it?

How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.

Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.

You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.

How long?

How old are you, Senor Colon?

Do they have such thoughts?

And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.

Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.

What's he doing?

We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!

You bloody...

Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.

I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.

Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.

But it's...

I can't take you to my place.

You considered becoming a prostitute?

Are you alright?

Is he your boyfriend?

A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.

What are you doing?

Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.

The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!

Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.

Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.

Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?

Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?

It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.

Any I.D.?

What's wrong?

Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...

You know what that is, right?

Nah, I musta missed it.

The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.

Hmmmm.

What would you call her?

Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.

I'll come with you.

I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.

So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.

Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?

Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.

Yeah.

Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.

I kill someone famous.

So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.

I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?

Eddie, are you okay?

Alright.

Alright.

Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?

No.  Tell me what you want to say.

Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!

We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.

Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?

What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?

Two weeks.

Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?

Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.

What is that?

In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?

This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'

Traitor!!

Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!

Well, he...

A cheap hotel.

No.  Go ahead.

What was that?

How did you start the fire this time?

I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?

-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.

Get outta here!

Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.

This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.

Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.

It's about my salary cheques.

That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.

Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?

I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.

I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.

Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.

You probably also know that we found them okay.

I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.

Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.

Too bad about Frank, isn't it?

Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.

CONTINUED

I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?

Oh, thank you very much.

And your charming little daughter?

Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?

Yes, I think so. Just about then.

Really?

Fortunately, they did.

Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.

Any ideas about the colour?

I see.

Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?

That's true.

Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?

We don't wash 'em, ya know.

That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.

Maybe you better have a Black Russian.

I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.

I want to drive awhile.

Hey, what kind of talk is that?

Hello, again.

After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...

I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.

Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.

Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.

We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.

We eat when I say we eat.

Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.

Well?

This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...

Hey, you wanna bet?

You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.

This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.

Yeah, right.  You want to try again?

I been waiting a long time for some money.

I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...

Where's luther?

We missed.

They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.

Hey, there she is...

Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.

Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.

Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...

He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.

Where the Christ do you think you're going?

Who are all these?

Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?

Tell me that's not the same guy.

I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?

You look awful.

Bullshit red tape.

A cop...

Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.

Hey, you're right.

Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?

Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.

Maybe you ought to buy me one.

Maybe that makes a nice excuse.

When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.

Call me later.

Thanks for the coffee.

Great place for lunch.

No wonder you're so popular.

Hello.

How do you know?

What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?

Whaddya think?

Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...

Who the hell are you?

Hard man to live with.

He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...

Stall.

I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...

When?

Come on, you can trust me. Please.

Let her go.

Five.  On credit.

Akta dedero ansila do mektet.

...We're saved!

Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again

...would you like a drink?

...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!

Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.

He's a she!

Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!

Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?

We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..

What are you doing?

Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?

And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?

Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.

They really made her...

I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.

I just found a picture of you.

Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!

...Priest...

Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...

Eto Akta Gamat!

Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?

Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?

...Hello?

Other than that... You all right?

I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?

Yeah?

Hello?

I'm sorry..

...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?

Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?

Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?

You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?

Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..

You get that off the screen?

I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.

You can sleep tomorrow... come on...

The cash man!

Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?

This is all that survived?

Have you identified it?

Sounds like a freak of nature to me.

They just landed in the desert.

Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..

How's our deal coming along?

I'm not accusing you...

I love you.

You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?

What happened to you?

What's going on, Tom?  What happened?

You're killing me...

Who are you calling?

What are these?

What are you talking about?

What the fuck... !

That's five thousand dollars.

Where's that?

Excellent.

What are these for?

Friend of yours?

Is that him?

Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.

Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.

This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.

They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.

Yeah, who's this?

What?

Who is this.

What the fuck are you.. ?

So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.

Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.

Keep moving.

You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...

I never killed anyone.

You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.

Look, you cocksucker...

Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.

You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...

Give me the film.

Big date tonight?

Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?

It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.

Once you pick it up you can't put it down.

Truman Capote.

Remember me?

I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.

How long you been working there?

I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.

I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?

What about me?

A daughter.

His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.

You're learning.

Wha... ?

I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."

He's odd.

Pittsburgh?

There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...

Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...

You... you need to go to the police.

You don't have any other choice.

Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.

Yes... ?

What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...

So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?

I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...

It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.

You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?

Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...

What is this?

Her belongings?

Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?

The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...

Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.

Alice, you think you can leave?

Kincaid and Joey died last night.

I can't go back to sleep again.

We'll figure it out.

I'm sure they're around.

I know.  I hardly have any time to study.

Then you saw him, too?

No...

Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.

No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.

I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.

T-T-Thanks Alice...

I don't get it.

So?

Nice neighborhood.

I'll tell you later.

You don't get it, he's after me...

In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --

Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?

Where is he?

About him?

Since when are you such a smart shopper?

It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.

You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?

Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...

You think that's the place she's buried?

No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?

They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.

I don't understand.

That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.

All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...

I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!

I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.

That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!

Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!

However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -

Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -

What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?

So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'

You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.

How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.

You hear that?

Well?

Dave - !

What about down?

You better take Powell and Carney with you --

With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --

We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!

....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?

The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!

'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?

You're sure it's Cyclops?

What's the running time?

What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?

Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.

Who?

...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.

I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.

This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?

I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.

What are you boys up to?

-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.

LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?

It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.

Done much shooting with that rifle yet?

You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.

Mmm.

I'm okay.

Drafted by the Red Sox.

They said.

The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.

Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --

Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.

Like you and Gordon?

No, I mean whereabouts.

Open the door, will ya?

I bet you did lots of bad things.

What then?

No what?

You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.

What? You called Mommy? Just now?

Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?

You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?

You're a policeman.

Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.

Tomorrow, Gordon.

You don't want the extra police pay?

Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?

That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.

What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.

Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.

What do I have to do for it?

The key, Wade.

I don't want her to go, Lillian.

Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?

Did you get his number?

New hat?  Jill's up, I see.

Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.

Call me.

...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.

Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.

No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.

Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?

Then... I guess you have to.

You've been married twice --

Are you sure they're home? Did you call?

What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?

Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.

Coffee's perked.

I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'

Who are you?

The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.

Rolfe.

Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.

You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!

Rolfe.

Who?

Well, it was an accident.

Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.

Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.

Anyone else want one? Rolfe?

Well, do you still plan to get married?

I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.

Find them everywhere. 

Which is?

So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.

It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?

You're one of Stravanavitch's men.

Oooooh, I'm good.

Daddy...

How you doing, sweetie?

Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...

There they are!

The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.

U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.

Got it.

If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.

The Chief Justice? What on earth for?

You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.

That's affirmative.

Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.

Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.

We copy. Stand by...  Tower?

Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.

Four...

Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.

There goes your ride.

Twenty minutes?

Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?

Sir, we stay with the President.

How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.

I don't know why you stayed.

Did they say anything about my family?

Where's my family?

One.

Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.

With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.

*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.

Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.

IT'S OPEN!

WE'RE HOOKED!

Forget it.  I was reading.

We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.

Dunn.

Elaine, what happened to us?

Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.

Elaine.

Elaine!

Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.

Ted, we've only got ten minutes.

Simon just ejected!

You mean...

For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.

Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.

Simon, what's happening?!

I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.

That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.

Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.

Request; life support systems check.

Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.

I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.

Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.

Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.

That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.

That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.

That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.

You folks need any help?

It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.

No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.

All right, it's a matter of death.

That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.

Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.

You've been hurt.

No.  I mean your relationship.

No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.

I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.

Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.

We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?

Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?

You got a telegram from head­quarters today.

Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

Ted...

I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.

See them, Elaine?

Good-bye, darling.

And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?

Did you decide on a runway yet?

What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'

Oh, I can't stand it.

How ya doing, honey?

Oh, I'd love to.

Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?

Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.

Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.

You okay?

He's not here.  Why ask me?

Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!

Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.

Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...

Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?

The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...

Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?

What's this?  What's going on?

What is this?

Get the picture?

Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.

Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.

A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.

You know that guy?

I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?

I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?

We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.

... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?

I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.

I'm going home.

She's going to divorce me.

Well, let's roll, George.

Stop the car.

It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.

How potent?

George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...

No!  We must do this alone.

What is this?!

How do I look?

Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.

To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.

Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.

Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.

One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?

You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...

Granger and Pitts are already on it.

What?

Can't lock up...

Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.

You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?

And it's too late to shut it down?

I'll go.

Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...

That's right.

It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.

Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...

You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?

Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --

This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --

You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.

Now, wait a second --

You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?

I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.

Where are your parents?  You have to try...

So.

What's the question?

Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.

Save it.

Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.

We got problems.

Maybe we got 'em demoralized.

Now many?

They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.

Locked.

Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?

Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.

You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.

Thanks.

So what do I tell this guy?

And how are we today?

Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.

Casey.  She's my only friend.

Cross my heart.

Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.

No, it's different, honey.

Yes.  A little girl.

Don't go!  Please.

Can we dream?

Look, I told you...

Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...

These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.

How do you know?

Where?

Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.

What does he look like?

I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.

And how will you make him keep it?

Why what, sir?

What is it?

Why not?

Tish-I'm tee. What's that?

No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.

How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?

Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -

Yes, my love?

Half the receipts! Stanzi!

When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.

Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.

Why not?

This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?

Why not?

These are originals?

Some service deserves service in return. No?

It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.

Well, thank you very much. You can go now.

Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?

Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?

What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.

Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.

Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!

I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.

It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.

Really?

I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.

What a charming idea. May I see?

A-flat, Majesty.

My pleasure.

Well, I'm glad to hear that.

As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!

Majesty!

Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.

Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?

Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?

Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?

Would you tell me why?

Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.

Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.

Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?

Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.

Why not?

Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.

Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.

Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.

Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?

Is he working?

Yes?

What?

What did he say? What did he say?

I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.

Of course! What else do you think they speak here?

I'm afraid I am.

It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!

Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?

What for?

Herr Sommer.

No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.

No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.

Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.

But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.

With all my heart, Mozart.

What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?

I have come to commission work from you.

How long will you give me?

Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.

Shall I answer it?

But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.

Where did I stop?

The Fire.

Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.

Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?

Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?

It couldn't be simpler.

Do you have me?

And that's it. Do you have it?

What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.

Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?

Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.

I don't think it was really decided, Director.

About what?

Are they?

How well are you trained in music?

Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.

No? Was Mozart a good man?

Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.

But not his body.

My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?

I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.

You mean that play?

He's setting that play to music?

I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.

Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.

Herr Salieri.

Can we come in?

How did he look?

Oh, Miss Price?

The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.

Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.

Dr. Hirsch?

What shall we do?

He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.

What shall we do?

It was a wolf.

I'm afraid you have to eat something.

You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.

This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.

You're a very beautiful girl.

Now what do you want to talk about?

That's easy enough.

David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.

Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.

How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?

Are you better now?

My friend Jack was just here.

Bathroom.

Tomorrow is the full moon.

It's silly of you to be apprehensive.

Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?

I'm off. There's food in the fridge.

The next corner we can get a cab.

We had an argument. He's being silly.

Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...

Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!

I think he's a Jew.

I looked.

Why are you doing this to me, Jack?

Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.

That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.

Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.

You've never had bad dreams before?

Yes.

You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.

I really don't know.

Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.

I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.

It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.

The Slaughtered Lamb?

What about it?

Beware the moon?

Come on, where?

What's the plan?

See anything?

You really scared me, you shithead.

I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.

Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.

So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.

Shut up, you zombie!

Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'

You're not real.

Get out of here, Jack!

Jack, are you really dead?

I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.

David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.

Dr. Hirsch?

What can we do to assist you?

Yes?

What's that?

Then you have some hot tea?

Remember the Alamo?

Hello, Tom.

What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!

Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest

If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?

Oscar, what's the matter?

No kidding?

Yeah.

And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.

When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.

Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!

Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.

Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?

What is the matter with you? You're trembling?

Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.

But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.

I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.

You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.

And now fair woman, I have you in my power.

Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?

Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.

Much better this morning, thank you.

Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.

Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .

Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?

Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?

My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?

Well, I

I already told him I was home.

No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!

Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.

That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.

All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.

You're lying!

They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.

Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!

He's at a board meeting.

Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!

Well . . . ?

Did you talk to him?

Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.

The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?

Dude Finlay?

No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.

What time did you get in?

Where's Charlie?

I think I may just go on to the reservation.

Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.

That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.

That was because of... the reputation the gang had.

Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.

Bob. I didn't...

Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.

Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...

Ride with me, cousin?

Hands off your hip, Cole.

She had a moustache.

Thanks for the help.

The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.

I got seven thousand.

"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."

I'm the better soldier, Jesse.

Dammit!

Missed you, cousin.

Where'd you get all these riders?

Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.

What the --

I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.

BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!

Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --

The safe. Now.

Great Chief of St. Louis send me.

What the --

What do you say, sir?

You know you're welcome any time!

Daddy, don't start with this again.

Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.

Web's dead.

Hello, Liberty Missoura!

That just might work.

She's still talking to Jesus.

Pinkertons. It's the railroad.

And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --

This has been a good year.

We're doing this for Ma.

A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?

Easterners.

The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.

Doc Mimms will --

Jesse, are you awake?

Jesse, is that your hand?

You're sick of my company?

Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.

Not if I find the right girl.

Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."

Yep.

You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.

I don't understand.

That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...

I beg your pardon?

Let me see that.

Yes?

The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.

Now let's have a drink.

Well, not exactly.

Really?

Thank you, Miss -- ?

My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.

Good.

Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.

You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.

The final route for the railroad is complete.

What is that?

This is him.

"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!

Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.

I can't.

You like it there, don't you?

Pick me up?

J&B. Straight.

This is Dorsia?

No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.

It's a plain end. I think.

What are you doing tonight?

Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?

So, you're looking great, how have you been?

We should do it.

Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.

Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.

Are you using minoxidil?

We need to talk.

It's over, Evelyn. It's all over

Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?

Listen, what about dinner?

No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?

Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?

Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...

It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?

Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?

Patrick? Is that you?

Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?

Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?

What's that, a gram?

I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.

I'm leaving. I'm getting out.

Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?

Dorsia.

Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?

Dorsia, yes?

Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.

Who?

Patrick?

Jean?

Want a bite?

Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.

Do you have a boyfriend?

I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.

Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.

Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.

She's my...cousin.

Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.

Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.

Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.

Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL

Perrier? San Pellegrino?

KIMBALL.

So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?

Don't you know this?

Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.

Actually, yes.

I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-

That's so typical, isn't it?

You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.

Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.

Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?

I had a date with a girl named Veronica.

Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?

No hash browns?

So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?

Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 

You're not what? Qualified for anything else?

I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.

Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.

How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?

Really? That's interesting.  Not great?

And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?

Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.

Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?

I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?

Is it over?

I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.

C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --

When's Brian coming for the TV?

It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?

If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.

That was -- different.

It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --

...What?

'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?

That'll be a test, won't it?

Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.

What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.

And Outpost? You're happy there?

You're living here?

What?

...When did you know?

That's gotta kill him, right?

Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.

Who's that?

You know a lot about art, I guess.

The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.

When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --

Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.

It scales, don't you think?

Had you talked to him much lately?

Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.

I'm okay. It's going well!

No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.

Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.

That's great! Thanks.

I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.

Okay, #2.

Gary?

Just thought his work should go on.

...You wanna work -- here?

Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?

Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?

You know mine.

Did you wanna be alone?

They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?

Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.

Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.

So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?

It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.

Who can we trust?

'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?

They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.

You could always say you have to go the bathroom.

Meet me at the other location.

...He knows.

Wanted to say goodbye to him...

So how'd you like the house?

What're they building?

There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.

May I wash you?

Care for some saki?

'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'

To my health.

I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.

Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.

Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.

Thank you.

Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.

Thank you, Basil.

Hello, Exposition.

Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.

Excuse me?

Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?

Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...

That does not compute.

I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.

I've got you, Dr. Evil!

Do I make you horny?

Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.

I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.

Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?

A limousine has just pulled up.

Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.

Let's go get him!

I hate having my picture taken.

Why?

Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.

I can't. You're drunk.

Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.

No, did you use a condom?

Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.

Hello, luv.

No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.

Not a good time to lose one's head.

What do we do now?

I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.

It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.

OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.

One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.

Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?

Here, have a piece of gum.

Don't mind if I do.

Noooooooooooooo!

Oh my God, he's back.

Commander, I have to log it...

But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.

We've got a lot of work to do.

Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.

Right.

Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.

Hi.

No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.

Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!

Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?

Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.

Fear ...

Would that I could say the Same.

I'm afraid that's impossible.

No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.

Your voice -- it's so familiar ...

Quite right, but we still make the rules.

Who?

This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?

About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...

You.

Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...

You know, I believe she's actually jealous.

I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --

... Showers followed by sunny periods.

Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.

I thought we were on our way.

You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?

I wasn't about to.

But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.

Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.

Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...

The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...

Three agents killed by bad weather...

Is that what you think?

Do you always drive this fast?

What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?

Steed ... !

Where am I?

Was I?

We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...

What is it?

When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.

Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...

Mrs. Peel?

English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...

Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?

Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.

Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.

Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.

Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...

Privately owned by ...

Steed

You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...

Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.

I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.

No, please! I beg you ...

Bang-bang ... you're dead.

Does Cole know about this?

I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.

Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.

I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?

Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.

Hey, you guys, what's going on?

I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.

All right!

And...

Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...

I don't want any trouble.

I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.

Hi, everybody. Am I late?

Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.

Cole?

Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.

Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?

Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.

Oh, those. Why do you ask?

Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...

I don't believe you.

Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?

This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?

I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.

What kind of job? I'm a housewife.

Jumbo, where the hell are the women?

Your whores never showed up.

That's it, prick lips.

Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.

Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?

Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?

Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.

Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.

What can I be doing for you?

You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.

Is that all the coke in the place?

You want to share it?

My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.

I just want to be alone.

Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.

You okay?

It's on the tenth floor.

Welcome, welcome, one and all.

The end.

Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...

Where'd she go?

What the hell is that?

I think you'll enjoy this table.

I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?

Rick, I'm concerned.

Who was that?

Reach out and snort someone.

Oh these moments do try me...

Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?

You know Knowlton pretty well?

Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...

-- Stephen, this is bullshit --

I like what you've done with the place.

Been ripping off fire stations?

Why'd you come here, Brian?

I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?

I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.

-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!

What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.

That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.

I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.

Anything else?

I'll handle it.

What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.

Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.

You think that's really any of your business?

Okay.

See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?

Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --

Hi.

Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?

What is --

You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --

I need another one, sir.

Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.

Where are you going?

-- Shhh.

But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.

Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.

This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.

Four months?

Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?

Yeah. Big fan.

Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.

Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".

What?

Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?

And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.

Fireman shit?

Dad!

We gotta roll, Stevie...

You can't talk about my brother like that...

I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --

Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.

Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.

They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.

See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.

Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.

You don't know him.

Nobody cares, Ronald.

Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?

First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?

But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...

The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.

How are you doing, man?

Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!

He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?

Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --

I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?

Keep trying.

...Benedict Arnold...

My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?

If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.

My righteous name is BIG BLACK.

What do you do?

And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...

What's wrong with him?

Why they gotta make my nose so big?

You can walk away.  We both can.

No offense.

I'm starvin' like Marvin.

Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.

If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?

My tap shoes.

What do I have to do?

I would like to change your name.

You're now Mantan.

I won't do it anymore.

Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?

No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?

Four minutes ago.

That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.

I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.

Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.

Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.

And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.

That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!

I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.

Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?

I gots to go, it's my Moms.

Go away, unless you got my money.

Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.

Good woman.  I trained her right.

I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.

Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.

How long has my father been like this?

So what's up with you?

How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.

What point is that?

I'm in till the end.

Can't you just quit?  Walk away?

You okay?

This is the group I was telling you about.

Just want to say good luck.

I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.

What is this?

For what?

Thanks.

Why'd you do that?

That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.

This is crazy.

Don't make me have to use this.

I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.

Hi, Mona.

This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work.

You feel good, not nervous?

So they can be on TV.

No joke.  Serious.

What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?

You must think I'm some kind of fool.

It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.

He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.

I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?

Finland.

How did you get this gig?

This is a TV show, not a music video.

I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.

Let Myrna finish.

No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.

Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.

Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.

No, not that.  How 'bout...

Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...

...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...

...aconite get it dat cheap.

Around...

I slept too near where I fell out.

Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?

I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.

Maybe you need to start.

Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.

I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.

So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.

This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?

Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.

Where's the beauty you promised me?

You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?

What are the Chevalier's intentions?

You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.

A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.

And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?

And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.

I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.

I'll match any man with the sword.

Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.

Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.

It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.

For whom else have you worked?

But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.

It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.

Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.

How so?

You want my heart?

Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?

Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.

Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.

Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?

But you refused me, Dorothy.

I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?

Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.

Was he cheated?

That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.

There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.

Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.

I beg your pardon?

Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?

He is only curious to know who you are.

He loves me, as I love you.

Can I at least have a drink?

Bill Styles...

Did -- did you --

He is the only one unaccounted for.

West was one thing, but this --

Why not?

I don't know... I like the Army.

There's no need...

Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?

Some.

Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!

So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --

You shot Childs and Nunez.

You saved Kendall's life --

He -- He made me do it --

What the fuck is going on?

He wouldn't kill anybody...

Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.

So you killed him?

What do you mean, West's?

We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --

His chest was hamburger --

I... I don't know...

Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.

He admitted it.

Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.

You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --

Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.

Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.

How do you know?

Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?

Where are they!

MAYBE WHAT --

The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...

A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.

No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.

It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.

They're taking your command, aren't they?

If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.

Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.

You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.

Hostile and uncooperative.

Ah, Christ

He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.

He's in interrogation?

Move him.

Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.

Baseball?

You're kidding.

Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.

But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --

"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?

Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?

Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --

So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?

Little bit.

We're fucked, I know --

You wanted to break him.

We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --

We need to talk --

You're a good man, Hardy.

West?

Do I have a choice in this?

Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.

A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.

The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --

How?

He said what?

It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --

I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.

What the fuck happened to you --

Thank God...

I used it to start the fire --

Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --

Tell him to shut up --

Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?

You think he did it?

Great, great. That's fantastic.

Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.

I know her uncle. Friends of the family.

Bloom like a flower?

This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.

You get the eye?

Will.

Can I see him?

Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?

Did you see that woman?

I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.

So I've heard.

In so many words, yes.

Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.

Hi. How are you feeling?

That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.

There was one time when I was eleven...

You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.

You --  -- are in for a surprise.

There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.

You owe me three-fifty.

Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.

I thought you weren't dying.

But the real story is how I got the car. You see...

I'm trying to make a metaphor here.

You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.

Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.

What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?

It's unbelievable.

You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.

You don't even know me.

Are you Jenny Hill?

Were you and my father having an affair?

Thank you. I'll bet you need to --

I'm going to get started on dishes.

I'm going with you.

You never told me how your parents met.

How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.

Is he awake?

Mom?

So you never bought any land.

I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.

Yeah it was okay.

It's enough isn't it?

You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.

What's this?

That's not a burn.

What?

To customers approaching the bank from the rear

You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.

I need to know who you are first please.

And...

Hold on.

What was that?

You must have a visa or something...

You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.

Do you believe in love?

How is bank?

I understand. I'm so sorry

He wants a lot of money.

I don't want to know.

They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.

I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.

Give me some money.

So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...

Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.

I don't want to talk about it.

Shut up. I'm not listening.

What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.

What?

It wasn't what I wanted.

Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?

Goodbye.

My name's Sophia.

I need to uh...

My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.

Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...

More cough syrup?

For your hands?

Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.

This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.

With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.

This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?

Ronnie ship out this mornin'?

Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.

Laz... You can't say nothin'...

GODDAMMIT, RAE!

Like a man.

Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.

Gal, you ain't right yet.

These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?

Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...

Now you get up! And you get in my house!

My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?

Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?

Tell me what to do.

You took care of your wife, like you do me?

Get'chu at that table up yonder.

I know that.

Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?

I don't want you to let go.

I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.

Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?

You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.

Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?

You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?

You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.

Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this?

And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?

So...  That your first time?

I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.

I feel better. Do you?

Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!

I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.

You got any money?

Alright. How much you need, ho?

Back-up.

Why?

... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --

Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --

Nick, have I been a good partner?

I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.

Let's go.

It's incredible.  Hit him or something.

... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.

Squid?

All right, how's the new partner?

Where're you going, Ichiro?

Nick!

It's Ichiro.  Ich.

Why the hell not?

It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.

You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?

Yakuza.

... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.

It's very small.

What's in the box?

Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.

I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.

You all right?

Think we'll get him, Nick?

An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.

Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.

She ever pull down her shades?

You'll get Ich killed.

Can't make you change your mind?

Dope?

I want a gun.

Could you fill me in?

While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.

You had my help, detective.

-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.

I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.

Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.

You trust me?

What's the point?

I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.

And what can he do for you?

I want more life, fucker.

Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.

But not to last.

Show me something?

I'd be happy to mention it to him.

When?

Then we're stupid and we'll die.

I think, therefore I am.

Six, huh?

The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.

She was gonna get away.

Yeah.

Well, when do you get paid?

Thank you very much.

I like you.

How old am I?

From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?

Money?

You sure?

I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.

You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?

This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...

That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.

Yeah?

It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.

It's artificial?

Are you apprehensive?

I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.

Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.

There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.

Two of us might be more effective than one.

I can imagine.

I told you I'd come back.

What do people do in the afternoon?

Did you cry when your father died?

I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.

You're sick, Deckard.

You know what I think?

And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?

We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.

I kinda get nervous when I take tests.

Know what a turtle is?

But I understand what you mean.

You want to go home?

What about friends?

I'm hungry, J.F.

What makes you think so?

Oh, now, that's a great one!

The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!

How do you do?

Please excuse this interruption.

Bon soir, mademoiselle!

Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.

I came on a bus.

Right.

Again.

Nope.

Over this?

Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!

That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.

I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!

See, ya.

Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!

We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.

I guess we'll need another locker.

There's something else I would like you to help me with.

Then forget it.

I don't want to be alone.

It does?

Stop that ma'am crap!

Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.

Where's he gone?

He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!

Hey, Eve!

No it's not!

I thought I was here to meet women.

Why?!  I think she's very attractive.

Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.

Okay. I like that.

That's ridiculous.

Why are you suddenly so mad at me?

No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--

I don't blame you!

I'm really sorry!

What?

There.

I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.

Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.

Is this because of the radiation?

Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.

All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!

Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.

These are wonderful.

What's baseball?

Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!

...the pipe tobacco.

One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.

My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!

You have very nice ceilings.

Not particularly.

It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.

Right on the button.

I've got goose-bumps all over me.

Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!

This must be very new.

I don't think so.

Yes. He likes windows.

Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?

Why did you park way back there?

What?!

No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.

Does that work?

You dial nine to get out.

Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.

No kiddin'. Well...good night.

I don't see anything!

Help you?

Hello.

How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?

See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.

Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.

Dad!

He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.

Right.

Well, where are you --

Oh, my God!

Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.

All back East.

You got a light, honey?

Really?

For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!

I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!

It's time.

Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.

Days??

To go up.

Hi, honey! Feeling better?

We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.

Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.

Oh, no.

Uh, oh. Now it's time.

I've noticed.

Yes!

Calvin?!

Watch this!

Calvin!

Get the presents and do the lights.

Let's eat our cake.

Yes, yes it is!

And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.

I forgot some of my stuff.

Stop it, you two!

So, Adam...where on earth are you from?

I don't know.

Alright, I will.

How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?

What's that mean?

To bed?

What?

Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.

Oh, no!

Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!

Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.

Wolf One -- say intentions.

I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.

I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.

Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.

By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?

I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.

Is that why you say it's horrible?

I guess you've seen some bad things.

Who knows you have these?

You're all through with this now?

For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.

Yes? What is it?

An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.

Yes.

You can hit me, if you want to.

Do you like me?

I made it go down the toilet.

No. But you're in very big trouble.

Yes.

Come in.

Yes. Frank--

Come on Dorothy.

Yes.

HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!

He's comin' back? What for?

He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.

Who's this fuck?

Look at these. What are these?

Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?

We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?

Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.

Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?

I mean, for good, Jeffrey.

I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.

Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.

Sandy?... Sandy, please.

Well.

Yeah, how did you know?

No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?

Were all these people questioned this afternoon?

It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?

That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.

You really do hear a lot, don't you?

I guess I'll see you sometime.

I'd like to talk to you about something.

Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?

Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.

Are you alright?

No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.

Here's to. An interesting experience.

Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.

What's with Mike?

You want a Dairy Queen?

Twice. Without her sensing anything?

Did you see her undressed?

Yeah?

No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.

Okay, okay.

Jeffrey? Why?

Sandy?

Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.

What are watchin' this junk for?

Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?

What did he bring him in for?

Just for him?

Up where?

Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.

Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!

Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?

She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.

What are you saying?

Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!

You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.

Mother, is that you?

What?! What are you doin'?

Yeah, we promise.

I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.

We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.

Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!

Don't even do it, ya bastard.

Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?

Know what we need, man?... some rope.

Charlie Bronson's always got rope.

I don't know they just always need it.

Oh, we're good man.

Give the guy a shot.

That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.

For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.

Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...

I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!

Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.

So what are you thinkin' here?

And the pennies?

The Greeks. The Italians.

Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.

Uh.  Shit, I, uh...

After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?

Oh my god!

Roc. You okay?

Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?

Yes.

Forgive me father.

Father, I'll do you right here.

Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.

I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.

Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.

It had an alarm.

OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --

Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!

Anthony, give me the fucking gun!

What about what that guy said?

What's wrong with him?

See if mine are in there.

Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.

Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.

Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?

See, now we've got a plan.

See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.

Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.

But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.

He's gone. He stole the car.

I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.

If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.

I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --

She doesn't need to know.

Our money situation is not good.

I had to give some to Inez.

When'd you get back?

What exactly is this place? Freezers?

Shit, Dignan.

Next week we'll be drinking piña coladas.

I don't want to be too much of a liability.

We all set?

Uh-huh?

I'm in position, Scarecrow.

What are you talking about?

There's not enough time.

So how is it in there? 

Shhh. Wait for my instructions.

Did Dignan take the test?

Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.

Are you serious?

Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.

Anthony, I --

What?

Was Future Man adopted?

Give him a second.

Jesus, Bob.

Yeah.

Were you born in Mexico?

Nice to meet you, Applejack.

Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.

I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.

Where'd they come from?

There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.

Yeah.

Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.

Well, what do you think?

No.

They are.

OK, Bob.

Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.

I paid for it.

You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.

You really think he'll remember you?

Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?

I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.

What the fuck possessed you?

Bob. Are you coming?

That could be anybody's.

Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.

How long has he been in there?

What do you mean get back?

You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.

It's too bad about what happened on the road.

I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?

That's OK.

Everything OK?

Do you have your own room?

I might have mentioned it.

Is he in?

Why?

No. Just pool.

And what are we looking for?

I want to know what happened.

And Bourne? Where's he now?

...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.

Berlin!

Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?

My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.

Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...

I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.

I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.

Sir...

Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]

They loved you.  And I killed them.

Front. Use your teeth.

You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?

-- what? --

You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.

But we were so careful.

That's crazy.

I don't want to move again... I like it here.

Switch! You drive!

God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.

Why are you here, then?

For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?

My first job.

Okay, how do you want to do it?

Who?

Oh, shit...

We need to get in there.

Alright... take it down.

I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?

Still...

How long have you worked for the agency?

I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??

Amnesia?

Good luck.

Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?

Some women like Dobermans --

Let's give him half an hour.

Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.

A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.

Peace?!

With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!

Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.

An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.

I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.

Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!

What is it?!

Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!

Now, my flower, do you understand?

Good day to you, M'Lords.

We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.

Rest, William.

I don't want to be a martyr.

Keep these. We're going too.

We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.

Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.

I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.

So more men were slaughtered uselessly!

Where is my son?

Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.

I have faced him. Have you?

But I won't give you up to any nobleman.

I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.

Then when?

I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.

Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?

M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.

Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?

You will die! It will be awful!

Drink this! It will dull your pain.

Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.

War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.

Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.

Who would do such a thing?

I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!

Fine speech. Now what do we do?

Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!

I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.

What happened?

Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?

How. Did you. Know that?

Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.

Where are you now?

Are you hurting her?

Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.

It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.

Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.

Where... where are my clothes?

Why are you doing all this for me?

I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.

I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...

What's happened to you?

I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.

On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.

Oh? There's proof now?

There's one major hole in your story.

You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.

What's happened to -- How are you doing that?

That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!

Just don't drop the ball, okay?

Smells like sex in here.

Come on, go on...

Can... can... Can I have this?

You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!

Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!

What the hell are you doing?

Lung cancer?

You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.

Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?

How long have you been married?

So you decided to go to America.

And you want to know --

Go back to Bulgaria.

I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.

I see.

Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.

Goodnight.

But Sacha always puts out that light --

I want you to take Miss Lund home.

I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --

Here you are.

Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.

That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.

Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?

I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --

We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.

I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?

Rick?

It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.

That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.

Not an easy day to forget.

With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.

Strange. I know so very little about you.

Yes, of course, we --

That's too far ahead to plan.

Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.

Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?

-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.

I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.

You used to be a much better liar, Sam.

I must find out what Berger knows.

Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?

Yes?

Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --

Well then, perhaps you also ---

I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.

Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?

I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.

Well, this might come in handy.

Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?

With pleasure. Won't you sit down?

And the honor of having served the Third Reich.

Is that all you wish to tell us?

Even in Berlin.

You will give us the names?

You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.

You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.

Hello, Louis.

I was misinformed.

You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.

How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.

Victor Laszlo.

This is the end of the chase.

It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.

Yeah, you were saying?

That makes Rick a citizen of the world.

Oh, no, Rick never --

And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.

Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?

I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?

If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.

What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.

Will I see you tonight?

Make it official, if you like.

Hello?

But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?

Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.

He'll double what I pay you.

Boss!

You ever going to bed?

They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?

Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?

What's that you're playing?

Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.

And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.

Where is she? Have you seen her?

Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.

What are you doing?

It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.

You can't make it.

I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.

Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?

Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?

Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.

Get back?  From where?

Chuck, you're breaking my heart.

I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.

There was a coffin?

I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.

My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?

I am one lucky guy.

Yes, yes he did.

Really?

What happened to your pants?

It seemed like she had such a good time last time.

Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.

Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...

I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?

Trying.

You what?

Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...

I didn't know we had sailboats.

I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.

Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?

Hello?

God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!

You're fucking dead!

I beat the odds!

That's all there is.

Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.

Permission to come aboard, sir.

Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.

Then I wasn't beautiful.

He'll need clothes... some money...

He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!

And that I can drive a truck!

What'd she die of?

How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?

Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.

Is your family in the apple business, too?

Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?

People watched the movies in their cars?

First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...

And what did she die of, exactly?

You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.

The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?

You don't miss it?

Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.

That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.

I *know* this was right.

Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?

Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?

Stop it! Just cut it out!

No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.

You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.

I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...

There! You said it was boring.

I thought they might take me.

Nobody special enough, Curly.

Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!

I just wanted to ask you...

*Liver* killed him?

Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?

Liberator...

No, I'm not. I need a job.

They're migrants.

You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.

I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!

Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?

Please listen to me! *Both* of you...

What business is you in, Homer?

I'm stayin', Homer.

It looks like scurvy.

If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.

Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.

How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?

Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.

Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.

Rose Rose?

You're not yet three months, are you?

What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.

Who cares?

It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.

They told me I was too old to serve.

You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!

They're *outrageous*, them rules!

She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?

You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!

Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.

Silicon Valley?

Can --

That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.

What's this?

Let's just slow down for a second...

Ten percent. Of how much?

Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.

It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.

And I think it's because of this redhead...

He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.

Nice.

Like what?

So we go to the bar.

Who's that?

Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.

Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.

Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.

Masters of our own destiny.

Moonan. Here. Shit...

That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!

It can buy you a new and better you.

You know what we're doing with the money.

Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.

Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...

Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.

Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.

What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.

Excuse me?

Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.

I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.

What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?

Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?

Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.

And some new clothes.

Uh... Everything okay?

You just put a mother of a jinx on us.

We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...

Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?

Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?

Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.

You are such a raving pussy sometimes.

Him.

But if you wanna talk about bad luck...

What do we do? We change the scam?

No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!

What happened?

Sorry. What?

Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.

Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.

Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --

Did he buy it?

Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?

He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.

Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.

It's just insurance.

Jack. Do you need a ride?

You're shaking.

I hate cheats.

But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.  No blow jobs. No screwing.

I got scared.

The Indian rope-trick.

Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.

What?!

Eight-fifty.

Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.

And your lady?

I couldn't resist them.

Take it back. Till you sell your book.

It came my way. 450 a week.

I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.

That girl, she works at the casino --

What?

Nothing about you.

For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. 

I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.

I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.

I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.

I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.

He doesn't gamble.

I didn't.

I owe a lot of money.

I know that. But you can now.

They mean it.

And I thought you were only after my body.

Next time it'll be my neck.

I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.

It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.

It's all relative.  I need the money too.

Yes.

I don't think we should meet again.

Hello...

Jani! Where are you?

She's my baby.

I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.

So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.

Who are these guys?

And the girls?

Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.

How many aces are left?

For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.

Girlfriend?

She's not in the gaming business is she?

This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.

You can start Monday week.

Why don't you take a break, Jack.

Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.

Thanks for the information.

The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.

The key!

No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!

Where's the fail-safe key?

Where is it? What did you do with it?

What the hell?

Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?

Talby, Talby, can you read me?

One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?

You are false data.

Therefore, I shall ignore you.

False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.

The only thing which exists is myself.

Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.

It is intuitively obvious.

This is fun.

That's it.

Why don't you have more time?

Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?

Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?

I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.

Pinback...

Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.

What are you gonna name it?

Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.

-- automatic channels open --

I need a diameter approximation.

Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.

Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?

What happened, Doolittle?

Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.

Commander Powell? Commander, hello!

We're running out of time, sir.

I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.

Sir?

Men... men... what happened, men?

Who are you?

Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?

No wire.

Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.

I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.

Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.

You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.

Some of us are trying to sleep.

Move it.

How're ya doin', Max.

'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?

Lemme put some clothes on.

Where'd you clip this?

Same old story.  Not interested.

You're light a deuce.

So Max, what do you do with all your money?

What a creep.

You didn't...

Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!

Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.

What else can we do?

Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--

No...

Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.

Who is...

Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?

So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?

How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?

Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.

Is the social studies class over for today?

Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--

You got a lotta nerve.

Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.

Bent.

Am I s'posed to be grateful?

Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.

The other one like you...

I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.

Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.

You believe that?

It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.

Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.

That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.

I'm looking for a lady who works here.

Know where I can find her?

Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.

Who is it?

What do you want?

You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.

And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.

Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.

Thank you.

As long as you're okay.

I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.

I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.

Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.

Morning, Sunshine...

Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--

You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.

That's odd...

No.

A fog bank.

You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.

Friends don't help other friends cheat.

Please...

So are dogs.

Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.

She's got my word.

Can you put that in a bag or something?

It's payday, need me to pick up your check?

Don't believe everything you hear on TV.

Right, the big one-oh.

You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.

Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?

A toy?

Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.

She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.

No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.

She was the one--

This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.

Thanks, miss.

Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.

Huh?

And he loves you back, doesn't he?

Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.

You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?

What's that?

Whoa... she is a killer.

No problem.

Sorry.

So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?

So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!

Any luck?

That's Sherry VanHafton.

Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.

What the fuck!

Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.

Now listen up. Here's the game plan.

I think we should try sneaking in.

Are you gettin' wise with me?

Dude, this is all I got.

Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.

Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?

It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.

It was stolen!

I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.

I got...

Change? What's wrong with what I got on?

Mom, what're we...?

Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.

Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.

I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!

Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?

Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!

It's gone.

Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...

Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!

Are you AFRAID?

I feel bad for his family.

Dr. Monnitoff?

Theoretically.

What effect do you think this would have on an infant?

You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.

Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.

How can you do that?

Where did you come from?

How old is Grandma Death?

What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!

Hey...

Wow. Did he go to jail?

That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.

We're moving through time.

Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?

So, we call them... IMGs.

Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.

You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?

Hey.

Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.

You're such a fuck-ass.

He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?

Where are you going?

I think he saved my life.

So, tell me about your day, Donald.

How are things going at school?

And they grow out of our stomachs?

I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.

People get hurt.

Hungry Hungry Hippos.

I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...

I think now that he might...

I can see him right now!

Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.

It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".

It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.

Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.

I got in. I'm going to Harvard.

Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.

If that's what you think is necessary.

Our son just called me a bitch.

What?

Did you just call me a fuck-ass?

No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?

I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.

Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.

Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.

What is this shit?

So, what do I say?

Oh, Amber...

Amber...

This, this... This is bullshit!

Here, I didn't get any.

Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.

So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.

Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.

Okay... well, bye.

Are we on "Cops" again?

Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!

That bitch from...

Wisconsin.

And the year before that?

Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?

Girls check in, but they don't check out.

Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!

Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.

Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.

From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king!

Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.

There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?

Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?

In case of fire, how long will it take to empty this place?

Who to?

I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?

Yes -- why?

You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --

What kind of a dog is he?

Half watch dog?

What do you whistle?

Hello...  Yes...  No, not yet... All right...  Goodbye.  That was for you again.  He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.

What other job you got?

I don't wanna stick out my tongue.

Why wasn't I insulted?

I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".

He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.

Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight... 

Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?

Now -- how many men you got in your army?

Anything else? 

Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?

Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.

It must be done right away.

We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA

Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.

Are you sure you're not tired?

Once more! 

I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.

Was it -- swine?

Your Excellency!

Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...

I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.

You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.

Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.

I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.

They have noble faces.

Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.

Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?

Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?

Yes.

You stay with me.

More romances for John?

Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.

What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!

DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!

Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!

He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!

You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.

Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.

A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?

Oh, is he a friend of yours?

Treves. Well done.

Can you imagine what his life has been like?

I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?

What is it, Treves?

How long has this man been here?

Oh, no.

Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?

It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.

Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...

Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?

Hello...

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness...

Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?

Who are they of?

Would you... would you like to see my mother?

No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.

Stand up, John. Let them see you.

Goodnight John. Sleep well.

Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.

Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?

Good Lord, Mr. Treves!

Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.

Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.

Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.

Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?

Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.

I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?

Pardon me?

It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....

How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?

Please! Please! What are those?

Those things in your hands.

What's the matter?

I've never LOVED anybody!

The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.

But you don't realize....

No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.

Do you believe I love you?

Erik! You've done what you came to do!

How?

What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?

You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?

A lot of people like our singing.

We're just not a very musical nation...

Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...

But it IS! Look!

To pay for the next expedition, of course.

Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!

I've come to take you back to the land of the living.

Why should you care?

What are you talking about?

Who have you been talking to?

It's magic.

What did he say?

Weren't we supposed to?

There is another way.

And you, Keitel Blacksmith.

Look, I bagged it last week.

Hy-Brasil?

I came to find my grandfather.

It can't do you any HARM...

You're wasting your time.

Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.

You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.

Can't make enough axe-heads!

The Blacksmith's Code says I must...

I should have got rid of you long ago!

It's a tradition.

But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.

Well, of course he is!

Well, go on! Go berserk!

And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...

Well... I'm game.

And you've got BOTH axes?

And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.

And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.

Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.

And I just liked you so much.

Come over after I'm done here?

I'm so excited. Yay!

I didn't have a chance to wrap it.

Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.

Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?

I'm sorry.

Why what?

Really?

I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --

Really? Because --

-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.

I like it.

I don't really know how --

Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.

Why wouldn't you think that about me?

Joel? It's Joel, right?

Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.

So you like bookstores, huh?

Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.

The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?

What do you want to hear?

Thanks.

Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.

And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?

So, I enjoyed meeting you.

Tomorrow?

Oh, thank God. It's going.

So, um --

You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.

I want to know you.

More?

Joely...

What if you hide me?

You remember what happened next?

There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.

Joel!

Do you remember what we talked about?

I dropped you off after. You said --

Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.

I had you pegged, didn't I?

You said...

No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.

But my sleeping is really fucked up.

Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?

I wish we did. You married?

I do sort of live with somebody though.

C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.

What if you stay this time?

I think I should go back.

Listen, did you want to make love?

-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.

Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.

I probably got the same thing as you.

Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.

Hi, it's Joel.

I might be making a mistake.

I should maybe talk to you.

I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...

How's the chicken?

Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.

So you're still on the Zoloft?

I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.

What? What do you mean?

What?

Don't say "we" when you mean "you."

How was it?

Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!

"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."

Stan... c'mon...

Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.

No way. I can handle this.

Hey.

What's this?

I know what it is.

Do you like quotes, Howard?

Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."

You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --

Stan? What's going on?

Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?

I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.

Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?

The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.

She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.

Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.

I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.

But I don't know how to polka.

But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.

Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.

You're political, then?

That's Jellybean!

No, I guess not.

Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.

What do you think?

Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?

What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.

But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.

Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.

I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?

I can see why they sent you along.

You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.

We have a man down...

Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.

Coffee.

You weren't there. I saw it.

How? The Bridge is gone.

We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...

How is he?

Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.

What is it?

It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."

What's wrong?

Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...

Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?

It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.

You're not seriously considering sending him?

I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?

...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.

Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.

But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...

This is Weir.

Peters is right, no one's here.

The blood came from somewhere, Peters...

I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.

Captain Miller, I just want to say...

It's insane.

What about it?

What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?

We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.

Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."

What are you?

There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.

Heading three-three-four...

We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.

It is now.  We're locked in.

Captain Miller...

Thank you.

Skipper...

Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.

It tastes bad.

I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.

I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.

Miller...

If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?

Weir can't be alive.

Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.

Claire...

Can you see a body?

There's no one in the corridor but us.

You can't do that.

Miller, do you read me, Peters --

A straight line.

What is it?

Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.

It must be hard, being so far away from her.

I don't think She's real big on hate.

I mean...

We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.

Where is Reed?

What do you want, Vic?

Reed said it'd be weeks till --

Ben?

What did you wish for, honey?

I can't take this.

Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --

When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?

I had it at four.

The shields on the station should protect us.

He's smart, powerful, successful --

We had a tough year.

Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --

We're working as hard as we can --

Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.

What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --

Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.

Yeah, well, his eyes say different.

What?

I mean, you feel a little feverish.

Back it down, Johnny!

He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --

Is that what you call it? "Real"?

Then what is it?

Leonard, how's the feed?

Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.

For science.

Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.

But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?

Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --

I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --

Funny how things turn out, isn't it?

Ben's still out there --

Come on, Ben, come on...

Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?

What are you doing here?

You said it was urgent.

If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --

Reed's gonna fix me up --

How much did they cost?

What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...

Go ahead. Just make it quick.

Easy, mon.

Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.

Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?

I don't know. I was just curious.

Does Mom know you have company?

Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?

Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?

Jeff you have company!

Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!

Oh. Hi.

Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.

It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.

I would. Yeah.

Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.

Mark. What happened to your date?

Hey, Mark. Is that you?

I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?

Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.

How've you been?

Who's that?

Are you going to ride that wave?

He is.

What the fuck is this guy doing?

It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!

My brother's car!

Don't you like him?

He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'

So what did you do?

Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.

I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.

Was it great?

I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.

Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'

All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'

How long does Doug take?

What's Doug do in Chicago?

Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!

Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.

Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.

Sometime?

Dartmouth?!

Yeah. I'm registered for this class.

I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.

Do you want to sit there, Jeff?

If you graduate.

Thanks for picking me up.

Are you really nineteen?

I think I better take you home.

Is this your first time?

You keep them.

Are you all right?

Aren't your parents asleep?

Where's Mike today?

Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.

Anything to drink?

What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.

Certainly, Mr. Duke!

Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...

What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?

Naw! That's science fiction stuff!

Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.

I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...

We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.

Where ya comin' from, young man?

A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.

Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.

"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."

If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...

Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!

You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.

Jesus creeping shit!

Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.

I want to leave fast.

Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.

Where'd you get that knife?

What tape?

You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?

You cheap honky sonofabitch...

The cops?

You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!

Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.

As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.

I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!

Read the newspapers.

Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to.

Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.

What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.

Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.

Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.

No, she's looking for you.

OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.

There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...

I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.

Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...

May I see your license.

Could I have that, please?

You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?

In that case, maybe she can help.

We'll meet in three hours?

IS IT CLEAR?!

So, your husband ditched you?

They're right here.

Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --

You all sure about this?

We just smeared a skunk.

I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.

So, what now? Did those things leave?

I'm in.

We're going to get help.

Um-hmmm.

How much you got?

Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.

So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?

Will these boards hold?

In the kitchen, under the sink.

Is it gassed up?

How many?

Max?

Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!

Bullshit.

Blow the goddamn hatch!

Move it!

Yeah, maybe.

Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?

If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.

Go! Go!

I admire your strength.

She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.

We should stick together out there.

Did we make it?

Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!

What're you doing?

Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.

Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.

And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.

Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.

Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.

I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?

Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house...  her bedroom. I can't ask you to...

...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.

What's up?

Hey, where's the fire, sister?

Get your clothes on.

There've been some calls.

You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?

Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...

Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.

Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?

No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.

I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.

Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.

Are you... are you hungry?

It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.

You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --

See you next weekend?

Age?

Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.

Why?

Just one minute...

Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!

Okay then...

I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?

You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...

I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.

Harry.

Don't be a rat, Harry.

Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.

How ya doin', Farmer?

What?

But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?

Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.

Don't start, Farmer.

Harry? Harry, where are you?!

Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!

Take a walk, pal.

I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...

Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!

What a man!

You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.

I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?

This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.

I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?

Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...

That would be okay.

Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?

Yeah.

Shit!

...Is that not true?

Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?

What happened? Who're you?

Mama...

Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?

But they're using you!

It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.

Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.

Well, who have we here...?

How long will you be?

I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!

You're not going anywhere!

Oh, just leave those things for now.

You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.

Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.

You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!

Yes...?

No, my dear. You must be mistaken.

Thanks are hardly necessary.

So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?

Normal. Average.

...Did you really say that?

...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?

I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.

Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.

I am as he made me. In his own image.

Your crime... as well as mine.

Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?

What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?

Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?

Friend?

You will honor your promise to me!

Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!

You dance so beautifully together.

Are you sure it can't hurt us?

What kind of God is He to will this?

Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!

Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!

You make me weak.

I give you my soul...

My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.

Do you know this man? Is there something between you?

We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.

Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.

I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.

I am not mad.

Quite a few.

All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!

Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.

We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.

This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?

Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.

For what?

What happened up there?

Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.

In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?

Professor Waldman.

Electricity.

Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.

Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.

How is it you come to be here?

I heard.

Your men are right to be afraid.

Do you share my madness?

Melvin Belli.

Cabin B is ready.

You draw very well.

Any particular reason?

You want to leave?

How come you're leaving?

It still hurts?

What'll you do when you leave here?

I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?

You can only do what you can do.

Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.

Help you clean up?

It sounded like Brenda.

Jack?

I wouldn't know.

What is it?

Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?

No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?

What hath God wrought?

Ow!

Jack?

Just a walk, for Chrissakes.

It's just a dream.

This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?

Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?

Have to drop you here, Steve.

What was that?

No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.

If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.

Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.

What's your name?

What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?

My children are not going with you, and that's that.

Yes.

Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?

I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?

Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.

Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.

I'm telling you, don't hurt her.

Now, is your shit together?

Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?

I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.

Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.

I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?

It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?

What do you think Mom would say?

I promise.

What's going on?

Do what?

Creepy guy.

Do you believe me?

Yeah.

How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?

I'm really sorry.

I'm sorry.

What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?

Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?

Best in Mexico.

Yeah?

Do they have cable?

All I'm saying --

I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.

Where's the woman?

What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?

Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?

This isn't gonna work.

I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.

I don't know, you just passed out.

We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."

What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.

What do you mean?

B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.

I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a man."

Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?

Oh, really.

Did you just have a brain-fart?

What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?

Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!

White House boys want a private meeting.

Think I overplayed it?

... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --

"The Lark Report."

The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.

Can't complain, ma'am.

Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?

Should probably ask him that.

So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?

You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.

So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.

So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?

Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three...

Just do it, okay?

O'Neil?

Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.

That was good headwork, lieutenant.

By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?

You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.

Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.

All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.

"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.

I'd sure like to know who.

They're more afraid of you.

Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.

So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.

Sorry, didn't mean to --

I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.

'Cool?

So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?

Do you?

Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.

O'Neil...

Anybody usin' these drawers here?

All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?

This ain't workin' right!

Thought you two were file-closed.

Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?

Yeah. Why are you asking?

What are you doing?

Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.

Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?

You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.

Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?

I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?

And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?

Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?

I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.

What are you doing here?

The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.

My life sucks.

What the hell are you doing?

Can I use some?

Mr. Caiman...

Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...

Not for a long time, now.

I'm sorry about all this.

They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.

Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.

Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?

The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?

Somebody must have seen it.

You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.

I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.

How did you get all of this stuff into the country?

Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to it.

I think we should leave now.

By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-

This is it?

Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.

Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.

At ease men.

There it is. The Beryllium sphere.

Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it

Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!

Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...

Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!

And note the sucked in gut.

Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-

Brandon.

I knew it!... I KNEW it!...

Yes...?

Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...

What do you mean?

What?  Up?

That's It?

The ship is sustaining structural damage.

Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?

... What does that mean?

A hologram...

No, I'll kill you. .

You Okay, Alex?

It's suicide.

Oh, they're so cute.

Your last name.

It's... I don't know.

It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.

I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...

We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?

More to the left... Stay parallel...

But I'm the Commander!

Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?

Hey... Hey where are you going?

All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.

I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'

Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.

Can it be repaired?

Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...

What?  What did he say?

Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?

Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.

You know, that's really getting annoying.

We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.

Tommy, look!  Those lights...

Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.

My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.

We.. We lie.

Weapons storage...

Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?

"Deception..." "Lies."

Oh, right, sorry.

Some say that Hessians are invincible.

I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.

Over three hundred miles.

Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?

They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.

After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table...

You, you just need a new flint, General.

Misunderstood what!?

Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?

Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?

By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?

General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.

Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?

Yessir.

I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?

George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.

Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.

Washington is perfect.  He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!

You think that?

General Lee is detained captain...

And, Hamilton?  Greene?

Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold.

Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!

'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?

'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.

These supplies...?

Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.

Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...

That's right...

It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!

Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.

I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.

The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!

General Greene?

Well, this must be about something!

Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.

Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.

Do you?  When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped.

What are you doing?

You're out of your mind!

All people have rights!

I say!

You hear that?

He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.

Who?

And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?

Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?

You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?

Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.

He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?

Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?

Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.

But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?

Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.

I really think I can be of service on this one.

I need the money.

The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.

You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.

Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.

Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?

Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one.

Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?

Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.

Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?

What?

Why would I do that?

You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.

You're an investor, is that it?

Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.

Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.

I'm looking at you.

Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?

Come on, Harry - Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.

Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.

That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.

Is that right, that's what you do for a living?

You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?

What's it called?

Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.

Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.

Just a thought.

Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?

No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.

What?

You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.

How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?

Here's your keys, Harry.

Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.

Yeah. That was a good party.

One we're producing.

It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?

Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.

I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.

I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.

Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.

So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?

Yeah?

You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?

Harry... My God...

Why not?

It's not Dave. It's a movie.

You don't act like it?

What took you so long?

No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.

I told you not to -

Yeah, but whose point of view?

Yeah? What three words, Harry?

Yeah, what'd he have to say?

Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?

Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?

But you are interested?

Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.

Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.

How about now?

What? You sure?

Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.

One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.

Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.

Let's not be too hasty.

When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.

Ready?

This's gonna hurt a little.

I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.

Try Wednesday.

What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.

If you get it back in one piece.

The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.

I thought you said it was just a blade.

But how long?

How long?

Or somebody stopped them.

If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.

Bodies're too fresh.

Damn barbaric is what it is.

The radio!

What?!

Don't fall asleep.

Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.

Then why didn't they take it.

What'd he look like?

Any dizziness?

Go on.

Coffee?

What'd you find up there?

Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?

Are you sure?

He needs a doctor.

They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.

It's not gonna hold us.

Couldn't sleep.

What do you think happened on this boat?

Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.

Something bad happened here, Murphy.

Over the gold.

What?

You killed them.

And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?

Greer to Murphy.

Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.

I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.

Call the Coastguard?

All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.

How much you figure that's worth, skipper?

What now?

Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?

Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.

Never been more thirsty in my life.

How're you feeling?

We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.

Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.

Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.

That cost me twenty grand at least.

Guess.

Someone from the past.

Are you still looking for a job?

Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.

Pumpkin, are you in there?

Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...

And what can you tell us about this... 

And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?

I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.

Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.

So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!

Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.

Jesus, look at this guy.

Hi... what's up?

Yeah, well --

Oh, hi...

I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.

Since when is she an "actress"?

Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!

Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --

"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?

Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.

You can have that one.

So what should we do?

Look, that's back when I hated you.

God, I think Josh is too mature for us.

What's he doing now?

Are you sure?

This is way too creepy.

We still have to go in there sometime.

There he is...

How about this?

That guy is totally amazing.

But those are our people...

Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.

Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!

Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?

Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?

Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...

Look, we have to get these...

What? When did you see Josh?!

When was this?

Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!

I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.

I dunno...

You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.

Wow... finally.

I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer!

A what?

Who does?

You still interested in that?

Oh, how "punk."

...are you waiting for a bus?

Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...

Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.

Is this one any good?

This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue.

How much is it?

Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --

You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?

Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!

God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!

We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.

Yeah, sure... very funny....

I really don't think it's a good idea.

Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?

So, why did you bring this along?

What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?

"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!

Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.

So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?

I promise I'll take good care of it.

What is that?

Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...

I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.

Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...

Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.

That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?

Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!

Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...

Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.

Well forget the art show... let's do something else.

Just someone so young...

No, of course not.

That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --

Where did you get this?

God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!

I'm just being realistic.

Yeah, sure. Of course.

Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!

Well, here's where the fun never stops!

Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?

Really, I don't know enough about it to...

Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?

What are you talking about?

It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...

You were contracted to work-

Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.

You've never built in Africa.

You'll need your confidence, I promise you.

Pleasant journey?

I do need to see Starling.

I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.

Understand, I had help-

You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited. 

I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.

Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?

-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.

Very good indeed.

Anything special about them?

Finish your tour?

I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."

I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse.  The pain is actually quite unbearable now.

What a good week.

Have you got it?

Samuel says you killed a lion.

I'll be bait alone?

Good luck.

How many do you think they've killed?

Why do the workers look unhappy?

It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.

Why so many?

Where do you go next?

Everybody has a choice.

Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.

We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.

Oh no.

Occasionally

Hello, Peter.

Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.

His name is Oscar.

I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.

So this is what you do, huh?

This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.

We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.

They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?

Maybe I should call Janine.

That's a terrible thing to say.

Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.

Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.

Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.

We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.

This is the one that looked at Dana.

I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --

The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.

You've got to do something!

Can I have some of your water?

Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.

I got you out of those bad tax shelters.

This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.

This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.

How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?

"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"

It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.

From where -- Neptune?

Six feet -- seven -- eight --

It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.

Who, Ray?

Well, Holmes, what do you think?

What's that?

Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.

Like a goat on garbage.

What happened?

Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.

Does it have any favorites?

Now that's one ugly dude.

You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.

How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.

Now where are you going?

Is it a star?

Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.

Oh, Dana, it's you ...

Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?

Are you the Gatekeeper?

You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.

There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.

I want to help you.

Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.

Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."

I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.

He is the Destructor.

Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.

Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...

This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.

That is one speedy mutt.

Did you see it?  What was it?

You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.

I want you to have this. 

Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?

Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?

Something was definitely here.

Trust me.  It will be bad.

Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.

Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.

You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.

Set entry grid.

Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.

What do you mean by "seen?"

This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.

But most people are afraid to even report these things.

Wow!  Does this pole still work?

Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.

How was your date?

I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.

Boy, that was a rough one.

It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.

Agile bastard, isn't he?

Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.

You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.

That's what you told me two days ago!

Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?

No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.

Those are priceless sculptures.

"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."

Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.

I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician...

The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...

The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.

Take grain away from the army?

Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.

Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.

It's because he comes off as the underdog.

Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!

"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.

The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.

It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?

My loyalties... were in doubt.

It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.

"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."

Where are they?

I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.

Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.

You brought the army into Rome.

He's very realistic.

What about their philosophy lessons?

The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!

Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.

When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.

They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!

You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?

Who the hell are you?

Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?

Death is a very light thing for you.

Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!

Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.

Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall.

Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?

Before they leave, get gold.

I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.

Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.

Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.

Do you know what you're going to do?

Do you want some dinner?

Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?

Could you do it?

I think I'd better go home now please.

Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.

I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?

Benjamin --

Benjamin -- do they know you?

Do you?

All right.

Yes.

You mean the one who --

Elaine --

No -- don't cry --

Don't cry. 

I'm meeting someone.

Where did he say he was going to meet you?

Yes.

Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...

I don't understand --

I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.

Benjamin?

I just don't think it would work.

Carl who?

Are we getting married tomorrow?

The day after tomorrow?

657-2036

This is Dr. Smith's answering service.

Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --

Are you listening?

You're not one of those agitators?

One of those outside agitators.

Yes sir?

How are you, Benjamin?

Will you take me home?

Will you come in, please?

What do you drink? Bourbon?

Aren't you?

Won't you unzip my dress?

Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?

Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --

Don't be nervous.

If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.

May I have a drink?

Do you want to get it now?

I got a single room.

But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --

To tell you?

Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --

Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.

Will you bring me a hanger?

Oh -- yes. Wood?

Wood or wire? They have both.

Thank you.

It is, isn't it? It is your first time.

That you're afraid --

Anything. Anything at all.

Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.

Oh.

I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.

What?

Always?

But what about the noise from the car. What if --

We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.

Now let's keep going here.

Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.

Why did you do that?

Well I can't.

Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?

Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?

I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?

At college.

What was your major?

Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?

I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?

Oh no. In the car you did it?

What kind of car was it?

Do you remember the make of the car?

No.

Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --

Good.

No.

I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?

Well, I'm not.

Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?

Did I say that?

Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.

Yes. Please. I want you to.

How?

Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.

Yes. Well -- goodnight.

No -- actually I'm not --

Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.

Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.

Oh, no.

Well why do you -- why do you think that?

I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --

You believe me, don't you?

But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.

I'm just --

How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.

Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?

Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.

What?

Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.

Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.

Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?

Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?

Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?

Now look -- please --

HUH?

Hello.

Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?

Is anything wrong?

The Carlsons' are here.

Turn 'em up.

I oughtn't to presume, but I --  I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!

You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre.

Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.

You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.

Need any help?

The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---

Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --

I've quit.

I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.

I'll pay you back.

He must be very nice.

Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 

What?

That was lovely.

Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.

Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --

The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?

I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?

No.

Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.

There.

You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.

Grusinskaya --

I'll go -- good-bye.

Why later?

You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.

No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...

Till then.

Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.

Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?

A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?

Goodnight, Kringelein. 

Oh -- good evening, Baron.

The war.

Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?

So that's how we stand, Baron.

For me?

Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --

And the child isn't coming?

Oh!

Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...

Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.

A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...

You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.

Excuse me, gentlemen.

There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably. 

You're trembling.

Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.

What's the matter?

So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.

When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...

How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?

What...! --

Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?

What brown hands you have.

Is that Mrs. Preysing.

Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?

Baron!

I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.

Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...

...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?

You see -- what we are interested in --

Let us cancel the engagement.

Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --

Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.

Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --

Last night?... There was no applause.

He will be on the train.

Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.

What is this insolence?

Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.

If you will wait one moment, sir.

What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.

Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.

You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.

Pretty as a picture.

Hi, Bobo.

How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?

You wanna talk to me straight up?

No.

It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...

You want a drink?

That's right. Take a little, leave a little.

You're a thousand percent right!

Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.

Right in front of the room.

You ruined me! You destroyed me!

Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?

Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!

Not much time.

Here you are! Two rich people!

The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.

I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.

What's up?

What? Me?

Well, uh... No.

See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?

A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.

What happened to your hand?

What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?

I like those.

Lucky? You call that lucky?

Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?

If you come out to the track, don't know me.

Expecting visitors?

You ought to put a bandage on that.

I just came back from Phoenix.

Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.

Why should they? The cops are satisfied.

I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.

A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!

Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.

Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.

And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.

A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.

What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.

For God's sake, Lilly!

Well, uh...

If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?

That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...

Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?

Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.

The tap. What you do for a living.

You're on the grift. Same as me.

You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.

The last I looked, we were just talking things over.

That's what I say.

What's that?

Mr. Simms.

Well, thank you. And thank them.

As which point she drops to her knees in pain...

I can be real stiff.

Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?

It's an option.

He found you, didn't he?

Linda!  He killed Linda!

It's John, isn't it?

This kid just wants his freedom.

What are you looking at?

Who?

Look, they're staring right at us.

I have to pee.

Better her than me.

No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.

What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?

No, Mom -- keep it on!

Promise?

Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...

What is it this time?

He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.

John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!

I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is everything all right in here?

This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.

So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.

Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.

You've created a monster.

What do you know about Michael?

Who else knew I had the baby?!

Home, sweet home.

I didn't tell you everything.

I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.

Can I have the Cadillac?

Could have happened to anybody.

What's funny about that?

When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.

You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."

I told you the uniform wouldn't help.

All the more reason to go to Africa.

Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"

I know you think that.

Would somebody please pass me the catsup?

What an awful sound!

Who's going to fly our helicopter now?

What went wrong?

I wouldn't drop my gun.

Hello.

And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?

Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?

What does he do--of an athletic nature?

Oh hell.

We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.

The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.

Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.

Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!

What kind of exercise?

What's this?

That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.

Gee whiz, Dad--

Dad--

"Hamburger Heaven."

I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.

You don't even know me.

What do you do for a living?

This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.

You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.

You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.

He hasn't had breakfast yet.

Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!

You used to like it stark!

I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.

I have some change!

All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.

Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.

Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!

I should have torn that door off its hinges.  Should have scrogged her ears off.  Should have broken the bed.  What do you want?  Well?

You learned this in some college course?

Well--what have we here?  A family.

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!

You're begging him to kill you?

Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?

Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.

Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?

The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?

Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.

Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.

You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.

None.

Ah!  You're ambulatory!

You've been bitten by bats?

Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.

What brought you back?

I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?

I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."

Don Quixote.

Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.

Leave the rifle here.

Who's dead?

Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?

Because he was cruel?

Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.

Something's made you sore.

That goes double for me.

No.

A what kind of doctor?

That's an interesting piece of news.

In a railroad accident many years ago.

I hate that thing.

Yes, he is.

What are his symptoms?

Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.

I hate that thing.

I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?

All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.

Did you see him?

Is he coming home?

It's true.

We made the date three months ago.

I wish Paul luck.

Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.

He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.

If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.

You know each other?

Thank you.  Thank you very much.

I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.

You've got to fight from time to time.

We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive.

The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.

You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?

"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"

Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?

The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.

What do you mean?

What do you mean?

I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.

Just one.

'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.

What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.

Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...

Are you the star of this picture?

No.

Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.

Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.

This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.

Up front?

When do we start?

Jesus.

Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.

Why? Are you a sex fiend?

What does that mean?  What does he do?

What the crap?

I can stop if you want.

I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'

More or less.

Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.

Rot in hell, honey.  He's busy now.

They are the same.

Why do you say that?

Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...

Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.

Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in.

Andy.

Yeah. You ever seen any of those?

Yeah. Probably.

But this is my apartment.

Do the police want to arrest me?

Yeah, sure.

Why don't you tell me something for a change?

What is it, Jake?

Is Marsha there?

Jake?

Who told you about this?

Where's Ratan?

Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.

This is from the movie I was talking about.

I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?

No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.

I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.

Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.

I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...

Not exactly...

I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?

Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.

Granville's looking for you anyway.

You can fuck off, too.

I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.

You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.

And what are you studying?

I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.

Took it?

Your tree.

Okay, lady. Out.

No.

Check.

Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.

What do you want?

Eh, no.

How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.

But this is my car.

But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?

Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.

All right.

Do you often model for Glaucus?

Me! No. Of course not.

It goes on and on.

Why do you say that?

What is it?

An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.

No.

Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.

I <u>think</u> I see it.

Did Confucius say that?

Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.

Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?

No. I'd feel stupid.

Oh.

But they have.

- end where I began.

Supper for two.

... which I hope will make you very happy.

Mother.

Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?

I'm going to marry the woman I love.

How do you do?

This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.

An ancient Japanese ceremony.

And why is that?

My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.

Would you care to talk about this friend?

Your classmates?

Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.

They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! "Throw the grenades," I shouted. "Mac, throw the grenades!" "He's dead," Joe said, and kept right on feeding me bullets.  Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat!  They kept falling, but they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake up on a stretcher. "Did we hold?" I asked the medic. "Yes, sir," he said, and I slipped into unconsciousness.

Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.

Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.

Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?

Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?

Well, I didn't.

You knew?

Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?

So... You're Kirsty, huh?

Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!

You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...

O.K. Let's go.

What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?

I... remember.

Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.

I need to touch it to "see"...

I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --

Don't get psychic with me.

How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck

harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --

Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??

You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.

What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --

Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!

The freak in the gas mask --

Do you believe in hell?

It's got a big stone -- in its hand --

Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --

I worry about you.

How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!

How does he know so much about me?

Where am I -- exactly, Sir?

"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."

I'm in way over my head, I know that much.

It is. You got yourself on TV again.

Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.

Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --

Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?

That voice --

Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.

No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?

What are you trying to say?

You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.

No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.

You want me to hold him down?

Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?

Nah, sounds too "needy."

Well good n-

Are you sure about this?

Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.

Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.

Out? Out out?

It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --

Hit me.

Just take it slowly.

Want to buy a bed?

Alright, let's give it another try.

The box... you opened it. We came.

Let me alone, will you?

Please listen to me --

You bastard --

Well can I come in or not?

Julia.

Don't look at me.

Later.

I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.

A long time.

This is what began it.

To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.

I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.

The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.

So where's the harm?

It smells damp.

Not exactly modern.

All right.

It's probably going to need stitches.

Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.

Is this upsetting you?

Huh?

Not much fun, is it?

I suppose that's right.

No, not much.

No personal details?

First time for everything.

Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.

Oh Christ.

You're awake. Good girl.

Who brought me in here?

I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.

Where are you?

What did you say?

You'd like the house.

It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?

Kirsty.

Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.

Where are you going?

Not that late.

Meaning what?

It's not what I heard.

What's wrong?

What?

I'll come back later, huh?

You gotta be kidding me.

Nice, Barry.

I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.

We can take your car.

"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.

Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"

"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --

Why would they care?

Hey.

I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.

They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.

Isn't it?

You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.

Why not?

What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --

That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?

Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?

Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?

What?

No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?

Anna.

Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...

May I help you?

Oh.  Okay.

Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but...

Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --

Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.

Huh?

'Morning, Dick.

Good weekend?

I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.

Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --

Let's not.

Rob.

Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.

Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.

Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.

I dunno.

Shit!

How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.

-- Alright, alright but --

So you weren't interested in music at all?

Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?

What's the obvious stuff?

Did you say something?

Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.

I suppose so.

Oh, Rob, shut up.

No problem.  If I can ask one question.

Of course it is.

Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.

I told you I slept with him.

Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.

This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.

Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.

What do you want to do?

What?

Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.

Laura...

You know the difference.

Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?

I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.

More confident, maybe.

Hi.

Where?

I know.

Rob here.

What's the -- hey, Liz --

Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...

The Conformist.

Are you okay?

So you'll stay?

Which way are you going?

Great.  Super-fantastic.

She left.  She's gone.

I knew this was going to happen.

What do you think?

It must have taken him a long time to get them together.

Thirteen hundred.

I think you have more.

Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.

We're not there yet, Justin.

We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.

I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.

I warned you.

That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.

No.

This is against the rules.

Do you play?

Jesus Christ.

I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?

I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.

You did kill those men.

No.  So what now?  We just wait?

Maybe it would do us both good.

And you are William Taupin, aren't you?

Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.

I didn't kill the watchman.

Sometimes innocents become involved.

Forget it.

Stop.

Afternoon.

I did at that.

Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?

Listen to me.  Hear the words.

Harder.  Concentrate harder.

Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!

I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.

You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.

You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.

Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.

I understand you joined up in Bremen.

Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.

Where!

I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.

Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.

Run!

Tradition.

Yes laddie, I have her.

This your present address?

His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.

What were _you_ looking for?

My condolences.

The resemblance is amazing.

Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?

Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.

Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?

Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."

Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?

You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.

If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.

But I don't gamble, Hilda!

What's the matter?

That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.

No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.

BRUCE!! How'd you get out?

I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.

Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.

Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.

Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?

Mother? But your mother --

I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.

Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.

And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...

I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.

Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.

Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.

Get out!

You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.

Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.

Duffy! Get Liebowitz!

This is the Morning Post you're talking to!

Hello, Hildy!

I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.

I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.

Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?

I haven't any hard feelings.

Sure you can. Come on.

I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?

You've got to help me, Hildy.

It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.

I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.

Bermuda.

Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.

The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.

Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.

Afraid? I should say not!

And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.

Allow me.

Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.

The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.

Never mind that. What's the story?

Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?

Where do you think you're going?

You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.

Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!

How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?

For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!

Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.

Double-crossing swine!

Where's Mrs. Baldwin?

Wait a minute!  Let go there!

We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.

Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.

He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?

Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.

Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.

How about Bruce's?

Hildy, darling!

It'll be Heaven!

Anything you want, Boss.

Sure, boss.

Walter!

Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!

Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?

Cooley, I want to talk to you.

I don't know --

Are you gentlemen all through with me?

I call. What you got?

Hey!

Better let us in on it, Mollie.

Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.

Boy, did you see her go?

Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?

I'll call.

Goodbye, Yonson.

What a chase!

Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.

No -- just coffee, Gus.

Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --

He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.

What went off?

Pete, I want to talk to you!

The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!

Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.

A sight for sore eyes!

You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!

I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.

Let him out of here, Lieutenant.

Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me! 

It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.

Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?

Here!

I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.

I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.

There's nothing crazy about that, is there?

Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.

Earl, you must never do that again.

They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.

Where are they gone? You know where they are?

I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.

What do you want?

How much do you make a week?

Why not?

No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!

You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.

Get out of here!

They wouldn't take it.

Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.

There she is!

Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?

Give him the you-know-what.

Pauline's mum got killed.

What are you doing here? This is our territory

The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.

My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."

That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.

Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.

Tell them about Pauline's mum.

But Dad, It's the News.

Wow!

Who pays for them?

Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.

What kind of war is this Mac?  Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about.

What about it?

There was talk of planting some when we first came.

I don't understand. Is there any point to it?

Don't panic!  Keep your head!

So you're going to be a grandfather.

And what's that?

You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?

I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.

I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.

Now take deep breaths, and push.

...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.

It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.

I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.

You're having me on, Molly.

Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.

Tiny's home.

Who's your Daddy!

How much further?

Is your brother ready to go?

I'd like to see that.

What?

Keep the change and get yourself a new name.

I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.

Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.

Shit, we really need to find some gas.

I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.

Really fucking awesome.

Keep straight on this road here.

OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.

Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?

Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.

And...

Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.

Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.

Aw, come on. It will be fun.

Hey, maybe she knows where this is?

Oh, yeah.

Yeah?

You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?

What are you laughing at?

I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.

Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.

Rise and shine.

Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.

God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.

It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.

Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.

How long has it been?

I still don't.

Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.

That's the understatement of the year.

Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.

Oh, right.

So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?

Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.

Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in.

I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.

No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.

I'm gonna go ask him.

Just back up.

I'll go. It's my fault.

God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.

This is way too fucked up for words.

Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.

I suggest you kids leave now.

Where's Bill?

Fuck you, you fucking freak!

What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.

Well hello, officer.

Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?

Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.

Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.

Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.

I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 

Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.

Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.

Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.

You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.

Over.

I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.

It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?

You remind me so much of Nathan.

Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?

Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.

No. Don't be silly. It's just...

Shall we close up, then?

Gabby, what is it?

I love you so much, Gabrielle.

What?

Anyway. Come already to the point.

I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.

Hunh.

You were wonderful!

I want our boy back.

I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.

My apologies, madam.

Nice night.

No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.

Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.

My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.

My brother says he likes you, too.

Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.

No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?

Your brother should have his license revoked.

I'm going to miss you.

No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.

It looks wonderful.

I'm sorry?

No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.

You do?

Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.

What are you doing in there?

What SPF, sweetie?

Come on.

Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!

Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.

What are you doing in there?

Who is it?

Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!

I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.

I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!

Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.

Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.

How's work?

Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!

Bravo to you, Puff!

Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.

I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.

Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.

Thanks to you, Nate.

You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.

Wait!

Mother?

Pittsburgh?

Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.

What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?

I want to talk to you.

To win.

You bastard.

In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?

Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?

Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.

How much do I owe you?

Stay with this kid. He's a loser.

Make it twenty.

Only when I work.

I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.

Character.

Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?

Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.

Seventy-five per cent.

How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.

I never saw you do anything else.

What happened? Somebody step on your hands?

Man named Turk Baker?

No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.

Thinking about what?

James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.

Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.

When do I raise the bet?

I wanna walk.

Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?

Yeah, that's right.

You got that wrong, mister. I am.

It's quiet.

Hey, how much are we ahead?

How much we got?

You don't need a drink.

What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?

Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.

What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?

This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?

Oh yeah? Where?

Yeah, that's what I think.

Findley.

Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?

How much you playin' for?

You quittin' too?

How long have you been waiting?

Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?

Have a nice trip.

Can I sit down?

It's the lights. And the scotch.

No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.

Eddie. The name is Eddie.

Why did you do that?

You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."

What did all this stuff cost you?

Don't you ever cook anything?

No, why should I? It's yours.

What are you writing?

What happened?

You glad?

What do you want to tell me?

Fifty-seven.

If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.

Your shot.

That's what the game's all about.

How much do you remember?

You want to find them.

I don't know.

Do you still want me to stay?

Shhh... don't talk.

That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?

The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --

Only got one kind.

A meteorite, Dad, look!

Which one's that?  The dull, red one.

Are you all right, Dad?

What happened to you?  Who was that?

What's wrong, Ellen?

Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.

How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?

This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.

Does it look to you like anything landed here?

No one comes here after dark.

But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...

We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.

Mom.  I gotta talk to you.

It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself.

Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.

In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.

What?

I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.

Love was never our problem.

Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?

We're losing them.

What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?

What the hell is this?

No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.

What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.

David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...

You still got the Olds?

What the hell are you doing?

General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.

Is my wife in the air?

Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?

Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.

We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.

Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?

Grey, you read me?

Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.

Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.

With their shields down it might be possible.

A meteor?

How do you know?

It's doing what?

You said you were on leave for the Fourth.

Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.

Dick-weed.

So, what do you do for a living?

Damn it!

I don't need it.

What the hell's going on?

Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?

Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.

Marcus!  I did it!

Your treat.

But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.

What about you?

Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!

Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?

Are you expected?

Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.

The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.

An old man's dream.

Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!

And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.

The Ark of the Covenant.

I said go around!

What are you going to do?

You came back for the book? Why?

But what are you doing here?

No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.

...you did it.

Rats?

They want my diary.

You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?

Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!

No! Don't Shoot!

Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.

That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?

You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.

Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.

A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.

Well... I can't think of anything.

Dad -- eleven o'clock!!

Nice landing.

It's a new experience for me.

But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".

Ready?

I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.

Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?

Where's my father?

My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?

This is your last chance.

Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?

Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".

I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?

Who?

They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.

Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?

I sense the fumes of opium in all this. Perhaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai.

Their stories are just fear and folklore.

Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.

You understand what he tells us?

Dr. Jones.

Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!

Indy?

Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?

What does it mean, Indy?

Come one, what's wrong?

Let up on the brake!

Give me the stones!

The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.

Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!

You don't look very good.

Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!

Took what?

A what...?

Don't let it pull you deeper!

Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!

What's happening?

Where'd you find your little bodyguard?

What about the future?

Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...

Not leftovers?

You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?

No -- don't you see -- crawling --

Wait -- what're you doing?

You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!

What?

I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.

Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!

I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!

Where are you,...Al?

No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.

Somebody's been here.

Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.

You're not crazy.

Of course you do!

I'll talk to them.

Behind us?

I want out.

Did you hear that?

JOE Or what?

I did. I brought you back here.

Just walk down the hall?

Like the guys that attacked us.

Anything...A feeling...a smell..?

Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.

I don't have any.

I can't do that.

It's illegal.

...and a license to kill...

The beach?

Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.

I don't want to eat it.

Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.

Al, are you doing anything in there?

What do I do?

.

You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.

I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.

You're not just after this girl, are you?

I feel like an idiot.

Joe, be careful!

You shut down your sensors.

No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?

Bingo.

Better. I found Ryuji.

Don't you think I stand out like this.

Come on, she's getting away.

Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.

Where are you going?

Don't touch a thing.

I can't...

Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.

What was it? What'd I say?

Holy...

Be quiet.

I have been... I think you're right.

Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.

Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.

Not that truth!

Sorry...

I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.

What is your name?

No!

I didn't do anything.

If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.

You didn't tell us you were coming?

You've cut your hair?

We'll have to let them go.

Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.

Who is your friend?

Enough ROmance.

It is to me too.

Well...

Home. Your home. The address on your form.

Joe.

Take the card.

Al?

Not...complaining, actually.

Don't do it!

Now you know what I know.

The fresh tuna?..

I can't do that?

Wait. What's your name?

...and sort of...disinterest.

But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.

Joe! What happened to you?

Your friends, did they ask about me?

Who did?

I'm leaving too.

This business is over.

Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?

I don't know. He mentioned a city.

Hiroshima.

Who was?

And Dieter.

Where we going?

That must be him. Water taxi.

Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?

Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.

Are you alright?

What did you tell them?

Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.

Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you

Kiss her you fool.

Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.

What could you find in this place?

Excuse me?

That's alright. Just tear it apart.

This the only spare?

Yeah.

Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...

What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?

Shit...

What are you cooking?

Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?

There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview.

A gun? Yes.

What caliber is my gun?

You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?

That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?

You can't take that... It's personal property...!

Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?

What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"

Hi, baby.

How prominent? What kind of placement?

Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.

Hello?

There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?

Use the bathroom.

My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --

Yeah.

Will independent sources corroborate that?

Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. 

What are you and Mike going to do?

Is it too late?

It would be better if he called us.

Alright?

I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.

I disappeared on you?

How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?

Coffee?

Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.

Should I just take the documents now?

You came all the way down here to tell me that?

Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?

Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?

The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?

Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?

My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.

Why?

I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...

You believe that?

You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.

Jeff...

B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...

Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?

...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...

Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?

ABC Telemarketing Company.

That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?

Where are you, anyway?

You try and have a good time.

Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...

Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?

Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.

The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...

Most certainly.

Object!

Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...

What a touching story.

And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.

Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.

I'd just like to have a word with her.

Is this Mr. Dumbarton?

You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!

What the hell is Botox?

It was a gift from a client.

Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.

Is she Asian?

My God.

That was Marvin Untermeyer.

He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.

Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?

You're vulnerable.

-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.

Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.

What is it you're after, Miles?

Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.

And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?

-- we are both sure that's what we want?

Yes? Marylin?

Marylin? When did I say...?

Screw you, asswipe!

A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!

I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?

You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?

Hmmm...

And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.

Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.

I don't believe you have "things."

I'm reporting you to the IRS.

Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?

You were going to have this thug...?

Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.

Murder!

Rex. Get away from the door.

Do you need a Tagamet?

So. Now what?

You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?

Wow.

Maybe.

Every week --

But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.

Well, that's about to change big time.

-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.

You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.

And it's good!

Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.

When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.

The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?

So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?

In anticipation of making you sick.

Wrigley!

Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?

I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!

...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.

She owes me a meal.

Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?

I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.

Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.

I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.

Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.

don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in

What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!

All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.

We'll go into that some other time.

Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.

Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?

Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.

I might.

You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.

What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!

You talk as if he were a gigoloor something.

A time will come when you'll thank me for this.

Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!

Who is he?

I'd like to have a talk with him.

Peter Warne! 

Oh, nono.

Are you going to see him?

What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?

Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 

We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.

Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?

No.

What do you think you're doing!

That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.

Why, noI  Yes . . . I guess I will.

Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?

That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?

Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.

I never thought of that.

A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?

Darn clever, these Armenians.

Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?

That, I suppose, makes everythinguhquite all right.

Peter Warne? I don't like it.

Here

Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?

Nope. No complaints.

Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.

It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.

It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. II did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?

Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 

Thanks, professor.

Oh, so now I was drunk!

Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!

We could start a two-person stock company. If things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]

Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!

Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.

I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?

You're crazy.

Thought you were hungry!

But what!

Carrots.

Number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]

Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're brokeand hungryand everything looks black. It's a long movement like this  with a follow through.

You! Don't make me laugh.

Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?

You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.

What about money?

sixseveneightnine

Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?

I just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish.  If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it, what's all the shootin' for, will you tell me? After all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed  Right now, that hay feels pretty good to you, doesn't it? Sure it does. 'Cause you were tiredand it's the only thing around.

Eight o'clock tonight.

Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.

I've been thinking about you.

Heyyou not up yet? Come oncome on!

I'm hungry.

What's up?

Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.

Get out of here!

What's the thousand bucks for?

Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.

Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?

Listen, manI'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?

If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.

There you gotrustin' people again. How many times did I tell you

Mebbe.

Not a minute!

Yeah.

Well, you're two up on me now. 

What's the idea?

Five G'sor I crab the works.

Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.

What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.

If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.

Susie, watch the language, would you please.

Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.

Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.

Recall any names?

Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?

Who?

You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.

Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.

Did he pay you for this?

Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?

And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!

Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."

Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!

With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?

Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?

Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.

...ever called Dean Andrews?

Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?

You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.

The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?

...give me protection?

Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.

Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?

Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?

Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.

Why?  What's wrong?

Who was paying you, Dave?

Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?

I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.

That's our case!

Daddy!  Where have you been?

Are we going away, Daddy?

...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.

We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?

Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.

Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?

The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.

All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.

I'm not sure I understand.

After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.

Let me show you his picture. 

No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?

...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...

Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.

I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.

I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...

These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.

Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.

I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!

That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.

Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.

Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?

Get a hold of yourself.

I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.

I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.

He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.

You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.

It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.

When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.

General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.

Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.

Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?

I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.

I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?

The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?

He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...

...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.

Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?

Dave Ferrie - you know about him?

Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?

HOLD IT, CHIEF...

I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.

I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.

You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?

That's all you've had all this time?

What are they?

Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral

What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.

You were there for me.

You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.

How old is that machine gun shit?

What'd ya mean?

That requires me goin' out tonight?

Uh-huh.

You got a good lawyer?

The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.

Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?

But now you're telling us now you do.

He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?

I'd love one, but not there.

That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.

Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.

You're not tired of it?

What have they told you?

You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.

No, you didn't. What branch?

With ten thousand? Nine.

That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.

But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.

Thanks, but I have my own now.

You're gonna offer to set him up?

How do you feel about getting old?

Really?

Does something else worry you?

Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.

You don't actually do it that way?

Will Ordell go for that?

You know some interesting people.

You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.

I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.

A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.

You do that?

And is that it?

Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...

I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.

Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.

It'll be more than that.

What if he checks it?

Tell him I want to give him his money.

He's already there.

Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.

I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.

Most of the times.

You ever see him sell guns?

How can you help us?

I imagine shit needs to be done.

...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.

White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.

It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.

I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.

She didn't say.

That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.

Yes. All those things are true.

I thought I did.

There was a guy with Melanie?

I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?

I have no idea.

What about you?

Oh, hi.

I'm waiting for the phone.

How long you been with Ordell?

He killed a guy who works for him the other day.

The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.

I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.

Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.

Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.

I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.

I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.

It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...

If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.

If you want.

The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...

Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.

He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.

That's a picture of me in Japan.

That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.

I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.

Is it dead?

Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.

That's not what I'm saying at all.  You know where he went?

Please.

What are you doin'?

I'm going to wait in the car.

This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.

Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?

I know you don't know. I said guess.

Who was Beaumont?

Yeah.

If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."

Louis, You tellin' me the truth?

Where you shot her.

What'd you shoot her with?

Jesus Christ.

I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.

You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?

What's his full name?

Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.

I can see that. Why?

If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?

Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.

The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?

How'd you find me?

In a way, yes.

She was afraid.

She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.

She's all alone.

Turn left.

Who is it?

Hope you don't mind keeping him company.

Dream on!

Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.

Are you all right?

You know, you got a strange line here.

Hello.

Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?

Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?

Hey, wait!

It's cold.

The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?

I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.

Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.

He say what they looked like?

Not me, buddy.

What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.

Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?

From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.

What are you talking about? You can barely stand.

Jake, you need to rest.

Are you in the service?

And how is your wife? Sarah, no?

Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?

No.  I see them.

Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.

Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?

Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.

If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?

I'm not cold.

It's not healthy with it closed.

Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.

I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.

Jake, is that you?

Why didn't you turn on the light?

Yeah, but for what?

Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.

Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.

What do you mean you can see?

Is that the one who died?

Wait. Don't.

I'm going home.

Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.

'Cause she's always on your mind.

It's still there, Jake.  Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ...

Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.

We're at Della's.

What do you mean? Where do you think?

What does it say?

Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!

Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.

How come? The army?

While you were in the shower.

He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.

I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.

Bullshit!

Please.

What's going on?

It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.

What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?

Where's West? New Jersey?

I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.

Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.

No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.

Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.

I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.

And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.

Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.

Please come quietly.

He'll never make it.

Push 'em back.

We're doing everything we can.

This is not a dream! This is my life.

Hello.

Speaking.

Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds.

Still married, Jake?

Everywhere, like a plague.

I have some ice from the machine.

Watch it punk, I'm armed.

Duck fuckers?

Goodbye old friend.

We can't lead him into the other hull!

Can't shut em' down from here.

Where the hell were you?!!

Kay-Em!

Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!

We'd need charges.

Then what do we do?!

Earth II.

You're a teacher.

How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?

Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.

Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.

Outta here?

Rizzo?!

His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.

Now what?

Well?

God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!

I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?

Push off toward us.

They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.

You must shut down the engines.

Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!

I'm gonna spew.

Jesus!

Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.

Kay-Em we made it!

Kicker!

The power's back up!

You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?

Hypothetically, how much are we talking?

I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?

Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.

Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...

We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.

Jason? He's on this ship?!

How do you open the damn door?

Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.

Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?

It's my charter. My party.

Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.

What about us?

He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!

It's three feet deep, Martin

It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.

How come you have to tell them that?

I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.

You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.

There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.

Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?

The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.

Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?

...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?

Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?

Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.

And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?

What? What?!

If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.

You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?

We will. There's something I've got to find out.

You all right?

You picked her up on the ferry.

And nobody else saw her in the water?

Think she might've run out on you?

You from around here?

One more after this, then I'm going home.

Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.

Well... is everything all right?

Who've you told this to, Lenny?

I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --

-- and an America's Cup Trials...

And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.

What's that supposed to prove?

Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.

Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?

Over there!

Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.

Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...

I'll drink to your leg.

That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!

Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.

Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.

Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.

Whose idea was it?

Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.

So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.

We could get back together too.

I don't like Katrina.

You're being really immature.

That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?

You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.

Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?

Why?

You know it's okay.

What, you mean as friends?

I try really hard, actually...

I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.

I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.

Just like our moms and teachers!

Wait, what's that supposed to mean?

They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?

Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.

I have no idea how to spit this out.

Oh, God...

Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?

Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.

Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.

Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?

Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?

Well, it can really only go two ways.

We definitely want it to have junk.

Cold feet.

Cool.

Oh God, you're one of those guys...

"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!

I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.

Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?

Is the baby okay?

Oh my God...

Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.

Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.

No...

Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?

Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?

You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...

They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.

Okay, this is no laughing matter.

Did you say you were thinking about adoption?

I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.

Yeah, like people in love.

Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.

Or...

So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?

What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?

All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."

Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!

Touche.

Aw, please Junebug?

How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?

Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!

She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.

I wish my funbags would get bigger.

God, why is everyone always staring at me?

He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.

Yes. Heating and air conditioning.

What do you make with that?

You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.

Like what? Be a rock star?

We're actually, finally doing this?

...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.

One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...

I'm cool.

Your pictures. Can I see 'em?

Adele... are you serious?

My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.

The police are after him, he's a murderer!

What's up Adele? Dinner ready?

Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.

What if they're dangerous?

Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?

Shush, Adele.

Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.

Yeah but, what is it?

Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.

...Mind if I hold that Bible?

Tight fit.

So what do you do Early?

Can't hurt.

You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?

That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?

Sure.

...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.

...Well then, that's how many I killed.

Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.

Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.

The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.

So how's it going?

Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.

We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...

Who said he's my good buddy?

I can't believe I agreed to do this.

Brian I want him out of our car!

Nervous?

Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?

...Janitor's job.

Could be.

...Diebold?

How many times have you gone unprotected?

Have you ever had anal intercourse?

Were they wearing condoms?

Well, how was it?

She can fuck?

Oh man, that's the best.

I can tell that she had just entered puberty.

And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.

Shit.

You wanna go to Paul's house?

I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.

Probably.

You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything.

Man, this guy is really good.

Yeah. Why you give money.

Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.

Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.

Casper.

Casper, where is he?

Yo, you think we killed that guy?

Sup then? Sup?

Hey.

I was just getting ready to take a bath.

Yeah. After I saw you last week.

I was lookin' for you all day today.

I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.

Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise.

You know what I want to do?

You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.

Come dance.

Telly is at Steven's?

How old are you?

Have you ever had anal intercourse?

Your a real philosopher.

Telly says was up.

I hate sucking dick!

I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.

I'm coming.

Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?

Yep.

Yeah.

And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.

So that's why Casper is how he is.

Right.

It was... it was.

He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.

Morpheus.

Are you crazy?

Yes you are.

The message!  I figured out--

It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.

What do you think?

You think he's dirty?

We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.

Take it easy.  Both of you.

The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.

I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.

Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?

A few people.

Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?

I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.

You'll find her.

Hello?

You know her?

And you want these girls to feel your pain?

What?

What makes you think I was there?

Hello.

You're next move should have been e2- e3.

Please... wait.

I know where you are.

What's this?

No problem.  We're in.

1985.  Hans Korshaud.

They asked who would be best suited for this and you--

Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.

Why did he?

You must be Erica.

That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?

Okay.  Nice meeting you.

Congratulations, dad.

You want to sleep in my bed tonight?

How long has she been dead?

What about prints?

He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.

Kathy?

Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.

Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.  All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night.  They're all the same type.  All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers.

It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.

This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.

Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?

Do you know how she found the apartment?

That's it?

He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!

Where were you last night?

Jeremy would have never killed himself.

Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.

Did you send the car?

We got a problem?

Peter...

Sorry.  I thought it was empty.

I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?

That's a very personal question.

Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?

Of course.

Relax.

Doesn't that scare you?

Why?

You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.

Wasn't I just talking about me?

It was.

I'm not playing a game now.

I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.

Fine.

Peter...

In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?

Peter...

I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.

You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.

Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.

I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.

Have they harmed you?

I will find you. I will be with you.

Yes.

That's a better one.

You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.

I am too old to climb down a rope.

There is nothing.

No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.

I can't reach her.

The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?

Yes.

Can she be forced?

Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!

He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful.

The spiral begins in the west.

She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!

Each to his fate.

Let me comfort you.

I don't think you'll grow careless.

They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.

And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.

Forgive me. It's childish to cry.

Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.

Go, join them.

Go. I command you.

What is that awful looking place?

What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.

Put me down, you lout!

Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.

He didn't join them. They joined him.

What news from our friends?

Freylag's stronghold?

For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.

You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!

A fine match.

You were attacked in the forest?

We seek the Fortress of Krull.

It is the time.

The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.

I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.

She has the power of vision.

There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.

You will come with me.

I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?

It's incredible! How did you do it?

Come on, get down!

Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.

...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?

Poor darling, and then?

...Don't you drink?

May I ask you a personal question?

I don't know... Five minutes.

No! I don't want to leave you!!

Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.

You can't sit here like that.

...OK... Good.

It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...

Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?

Have you ever been in Messina, son?

I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.

Salute.

You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.

What is it?

And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?

It's impossible.

She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?

Nothing's going to happen.

Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.

I have to finish first.

What would you like us to do?

We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.

How long does this... Mania last?

Mine.

Are you a preacher?

A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?

What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?

Yes -- you are.

I've seen it before.

The new store?

Why do you polish that thing all the time?

I want children.

Your father?

I don't know.

Why there?

Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.

From where?

Most certainly.

That's a reasonable assumption.

Doubts?  About what?

Red flags man.

It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.

I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.

I thought you were asleep.

Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...

Each inch represents 150 miles...

Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.

Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett...  Pride and Prejudice.

They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.

I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them.

Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.

I need to show her how much I love her Kris.

Tom Joad?

Come on Mr. Parker.

We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.

In a hospital.

You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.

Hello, Mr. Parker.

What's your shoe size?

If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.

There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.

Non-alcoholic malt beverage?

Orange soda?

Sparkling apple cider?

One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.

That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.

You're pretty drunk.

Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.

I guess I do too.

I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.

If I was I'm sorry.

I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?

Yes.

Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.

Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.

What do you mean?

Don't you like me, Ben?

Sera... what you don't understand is...

Hi!

Ben?

Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.

I am planning to go out and do some work.

I like women who wear mismatched earrings.

What do you mean?

I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.

Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.

Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.

Your color.

I like it here with you.

Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.

Will you lighten up, please?

How'd this happen?

The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.

You have been lonely?

Where have you been?

Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.

What alibi?

I loved him!

What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.

He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?

I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!

Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.

And when you came downstairs, what happened?

But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.

Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?

How many, would you say?

All I know is -- it's not Brooke.

I'm sorry, but --

You're hitting on me?

You're not going up there.

I do. I'm not allowing it.

Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?

What's going on?

I'm sorry?

Is she?

I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.

So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?

How'd it go at the trial?

You can't go home!

Uh -- family.

I'm a bitch.

What if -- you know -- it's not the night?

We still love you. Sisters forever!

Here. You're gonna need this.

Josh proposed!

Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.

Don't ask.

Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.

But maybe it's not what you think.

The what?

I can't.

In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.

Whoa -- Why?

As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.

How could this happen?

What're you doing here?!

Yes? Ms. Woods?

Maiden name -- Daniels.  You know her?

Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.

Of course.

I completely agree.

I'm sorry, Elle, I just --

Thanks for the backup.

Is it a Kappa?

Why?!

Why so few?

You go?  Not watch fun?

What?

My generosity is not so large as that.

You're magnificent.

Like some vile toadstool.

Why have you brought me here?

Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...

Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?

Yes?

When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.

You're a beast!

It sounded like it came from the courtyard.

To be strong and free... that is all I desire.

What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.

What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.

No, wait... please... listen...

Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.

You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.

I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.

Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.

Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?

Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.

The princess is dead.

Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.

I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!

Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.

I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?

Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.

Track the demon to his lair.

I'm sure.  It spoke to me.

Better to kill than be disturbed.

I pray always to be worthy of it.

What make ye of that, Jack?

Is she... dead?

Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.

There's more than one way to spring a trap.

Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...

That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.

Aye.  We're good as inside.

Nonsense!  Course it matters.

Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!

Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.

I'll do anything... face any challenge!

I was with the Princess.

Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.

Barely living, from the looks of it.

Aye... my Lord...

A promise is a sacred oath.

Jack!

I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.

Who?

How bad was the unicorn's wound?

Its powers are strong.

Tis the truth.

Lili!  No!

No!  I won't let it happen...

No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!

Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?

Sigurd's sword...

Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.

He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.

I don't believe you.

Courage, Jack.

Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.

Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...

Please...

I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.

What's she doing?

How came you by this blade?

No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...

Let that be our problem, just get us there.

It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...

And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!

And video games after!

What's that for?

So put your plans of my room in the trash.

Do you guys feel like painting?

Mom?

Atonement.

I'm living here while I build another house.

Don't you have school?

My keys.

Can you keep Sam straight?

I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?

Where's your dad?

I can't even take a shower here.

I might not stay, anyway.

You hate your father.

He won't leave my room.

I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?

Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.

I'm good, thanks.

All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.

I've been here twenty years.

Listen...maybe I can get you a year.

Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.

I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.

Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?

I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.

Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.

I'll be around to check up on you.

Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?

I hate turkey.

You'll have money when you work.

When are you going to be back?

You can't make me do a thing.

I took some of your Vicodin.

I know the feeling.

That's not true.

I know parts of who you are.

When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.

I gave up on you.

Are you talking?

Sun glasses?

Why wouldn't she leave?

I loved him too much.

I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.

What kind of house?

I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.

Ah!  Oh....

Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.

Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?

Lock the door behind you.

What?

I was parked in day parking.

There's nothing anymore to stop me.

I love those doors.

I did say he could go.

Go in there and lick his attitude.

Do you need help?

That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?

You've never said that before.

I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.

Don't move!

He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.

Then you tell me, what just happened?

I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.

Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.

You never really trusted me.

I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.

You're sure about this?

Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?

Nothing R, okay?

Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.

Married?

She always said that if you were on the outside...

Want me to come back some other time?

I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.

You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?

You know I trust you, Claude.

Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.

Comfortable?

Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?

Can't you remember your own name?

Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.

Sure I do. What's your name again?

That's some long green.

No, tell me what's so funny.

Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.

I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.

That's right, a loan officer.

My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.

Alright. You want some pie?

She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...

What can I say? When the spirit moves me.

What are you talking about?

Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.

Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!

What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?

No, man. I want you to have it.

You want out of this place, don't you? Don't tell me you're starting to like it here.

What does that mean?

Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --

The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?

I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?

You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?

You drew this?!

It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.

What about us? Don't forget to mention us.

It's a pardon from the governor.

Let it go, Claude.

One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.

He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.

I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.

I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.

I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.

What the hell are you doing?

Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.

Damn, it was getting hot in there.

Back to New York for starters.

This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.

Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.

Just put some mustard on it and eat it.

If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead.

How you doin'?

We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.

Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?

He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.

I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.

Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.

Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?

I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.

Who?

What are you in for, Willie?

Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.

Where'd you get this?

Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.

He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.

Now will you get in the flask?

"Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.

And give you a good buzz.

Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...

How did you see me?

Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.

You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.

Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!

From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.

We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.

I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.

What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?

In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.

No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.

I mean... tough break.

To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.

Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.

That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.

Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?

You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.

Bus?

You know, I was the one who created Hell.

So go get 'em, Jimmy!

I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!

Easy, Liberace.

Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.

That's a big pass, Elton John.

Schnapps...

This don't look good.

So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...

So I followed him...

Adrian?

That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.

My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.

If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.

This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?

Hey.

I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.

You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.

We're going to Jersey?

Don't do it.

Yes. What is rent?

You callin' me a thief, my man?

I'm a Sandman!

How do you think we got here??!!

Never a pair. I have never had a pair.

You missed something special.

Who invited you?

I just might look in on New You 483 myself.

Of course.

What's going on, Logan?!

Where do you live, Mary?

Why aren't you in Nursery?

You prefer women?

Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.

You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --

I couldn't get you out of my mind.

Of course.

You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?

Why tell me?

About running, dying what?

Are you here to help me?

If you trusted me, you'd know.

When did you begin to question Lastday?

Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.

Are you taking me to them?

Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...

You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,

What do you suppose this was...?

You're really one of us now, aren't you?

I hate outside! I hate it!

What does it mean?

You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?

...But I still have the choice...?

"Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?

Is it inside the city?

Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.

Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...

How long have you been living here?

To a city with thousands and thousands of people.

I'm sorry.

Sure, what's wrong with that?

This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?

You okay, man?

You're a musician?

I like to remember things my own way.

Very strange.

How would you like to take me to dinner?

What's he do?

So, should I call Andy?

You all right?

Alice...

You don't look so good.

We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.

A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.

Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.

Where is he now?

If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?

Yeah, Mack?

I wouldn't know how.

What is this, Rogoff?

He's not Madison?

Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.

We've met before, haven't we?

At your house. Don't you remember?

That's why I married you.

When you didn't come to the club.

You're up early.

Where would you feel safe?

I thought you were getting me a drink?

I told you to stay in the car!

The heart, I guess.

Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.

Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.

I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.

At sixty?

How ya doin', Pete?

Mr. Eddy?

I missed you.

What are you guys doin'?

Last time I saw you.

Whatiya mean, Sheila?

Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?

Sheila...

Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!

What about those men we met this morning?

A what?

Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?

Yes, it just shows  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?

Don't call me brother.

I say, good morning, Lovey.

I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.

I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.

Yes.

He might have lost his way.

Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?

Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!

Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.

And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.

Have I?

You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.

And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!

Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.

then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!

It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?

Yeah. I though you ran this joint.

You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?

Hey - look!

There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.

I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?

And the wine - excellent.

Oh, good heavens, no!

But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?

Well, it must have taken

Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.

Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.

Please let me help you.

Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.

Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.

As far away as I ever want to be.

It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?

Sondra Bizet.

We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.

And be sure that none of the natives get in.

The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.

Bob, these are all that are left.

The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.

Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?

George, what are you going to do?

What are these people?

Yes.

What's it mean?

Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?

George, what do you think you're doing?

I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?

What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.

It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned

I'd go mad!

You say the porters are waiting for us?

Where did you come from?

That fellow got on at Baskul.

We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.

Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.

You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?

A man whose life was empty!

I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!

There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.

It would serve you right if you were left behind.

You'll wait till you rot!

The hell were you thinking?

We have one motto: Peace on Earth.

Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.

What's so funny, cadet Cowan?

Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan?

So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.

Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.

Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?

Which do you have your money on, Dee?

Kay, listen, I dunno what got into--

This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.

Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.

It's a bug.

So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?

I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.

Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?

Something's wrong here.

Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?

Looks like a train ticket.

Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?

Jesus...

"Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..."

Kay--

How does that help me?

We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.

I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...

Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.

Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!

Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.

Kay, you're scaring your partner.

I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.

So... how'd you hear about this?

Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.

I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.

I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...

What the hell does that mean?

Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?

The kid looked desperate.  I figured...

And I'm arranging deportation papers.

Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.

Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?

I know what this is.    Zed, you in?

Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?

They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.

I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...

This it?

How's Dee?

No.  Follow him.

I have to go back.

Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.

-- but he didn't.

Just some guy... they found.

That's not much.

There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.

I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?

Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?

Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"

You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.

If he's looking for a flaw in the system --

Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --

Somebody named Leo Crow.

I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.

Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.

You don't have to do this, Chief.

We can't grab it...

Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?

Red Ball?

I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.

I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.

Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.

But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?

You set me up...

I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!

She was looking right at me.

She spoke to me.

I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...

She's a precog?

C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.

Stop --

I scored a goal!

Come on!

Sean -- you're not real.

Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.

I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.

Tell me, who was it, set this up?

Just what is it you think I can do for you?

You don't seem all that proud.

You're talking about the precogs...

Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.

How can you avoid a man you've never met?

Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?

I believe in that system...

Where?

Who?

Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?

I understand.

He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?

It's the same prevision.

Precog Deja Vu...

Can't they shut that off?

The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.

Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.

Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.

It doesn't matter.  He wins.

What kind of cop were you before this?

I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?

Raincheck?

Howard --

I don't have any sugar either.

It was nobody's fault.

Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.

Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?

Yeah.

He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?

Yeah, snifters are for cognac --

Honestly, the suites are all about the same.

It's on West Broadway.

I don't get it. What do you do?

Will you leave me alone, already...? No, Sean, it's over... I don't care... As a matter of fact, I am... Yeah. In his hotel room...

He's great, right. Is he great?

You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.

A elephant seal. Where's mommy?

You're not my daddy.

Uncle Bobby?

I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.

No. What kind of bachelor party?

Oh my god. What happened?

They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.

She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.

Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.

Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!

Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!

Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.

It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?

Yeah.

So, when's the drop.

What's that?

Heard of them.

A million. Easy.

You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.

Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.

Yeah. Sure.

Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?

I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --

'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?.

Hi. I, uh, think that's us.

Where is the Soho Grand?

So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?

Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?

No. Just the cross streets.

'Trustafarians?'

Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...

So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?

We're with Ruiz.

Any time, bro.

You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.

So, it's not a winning record.

Yeah. Page me. You know the number?

Ask if he said anything to her.

I'll page you with the number.

We need guns.

We look good this year.

Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.

We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.

I gotta pick up the baby.

How'd you unlock my phone?

No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --

Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?

Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.

Jesus, man. Plus ten?

Great. On my fucking room.

Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.

What are you doing?

They didn't say an address?

How'd they know who you were?

You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.

You just don't fucking get it, do you?

What the fuck is that supposed --

Yeah. What vibe?

So is this the drop?

He woulda told us right?

Why you gotta make everything difficult?

You fucking nuts?

What the fuck was that about?

He wants to see us now.

You gonna shank him in the shower?

Let's do it.

Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.

I'm pretty sure we do.

You wanna see how fast I get a gun?

No.

Eighty five.

You did?

This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.

Three and a half hours?

Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice...

Fine, fine. And you were...?

Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.  You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?

You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?

Yes?

Yes?

You strapped?

What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'

Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.

Here they are, then.

Come, now. You just got here.

Yeah.

So you're our own private guy?

Don't worry. I get it.

No. I'll take a strega.

No...

And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?

I am.

Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.

What they call you?

Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.

How's it feel?

Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there?

Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.

Shit, what else she gonna say?

I'm wearing, Archie.

And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.

Let Billie finish.

Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --

Yeah, got to do something about you.

If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?

Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?

Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?

I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.

Don't con me.

What? Everybody knows God is White.

What the hell for, man?

Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.

You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.

I don't know how.

Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?

What can I do for you?

Do you?

What points?

Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.

But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.

I think so. Can you catch a plane?

What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.

I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.

Brother Earl.

Brother Minister, what is wrong?

Why don't you just ask your question?

As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.

You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?

The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew --

Let's go.

I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.

Get out.

Did you hear me?!

How many you turning out?

Another one?

To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.

I'm with you, Brother Minister.

You're my father.

That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.

You the man.

You will, baby -- if the time come.

That's a fine chick.

Bang, bang. You're dead.

Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.

I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.

I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.

Who the hell are they?

Only a pig could do a thing like that.

Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.

Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.

I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.

Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.

It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.

I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.

Where does he live?

[Reina Rosas.]

[Daniel.]

[Who's Tazinari?]

[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]

[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]

[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]

Who's he?

[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]

[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]

[How much do you want?]

[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]

[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]

[Yes. Many times.]

[There was no ten million dollars.]

[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]

Were you provided with a gun?

Is it loaded?

And what if amateurs try it?

I'm here.

So what's wrong?

So how's business?

But don't you stay in El Paso?

Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?

We're taking a different way home.

So you were unhappy?

And don't start crying.

How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?

The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.

What's so important in Los Angeles?

You think too much?

Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.

The world of our children. How dare they?

You're American.

I don't believe you.

Where are you?

The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.

If she pisses you off, you get another one.

All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.

For an American she understands this country very well.

[You have the money.]

Good news. You're going back to school.

I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.

I'll call you from Detroit, baby.

I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.

She likes him.

It will be a hard break.

[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]

[You only fuck me to get information.]

He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.

You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?

Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.

Waddaya gonna do now?

Who you gonna call?

Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?

She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?

Marty.

Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.

I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.

Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.

I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?

So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.

I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.

It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.

...It's really a fine opportunity for me. But I'm not sure I want to be a department head. It's mostly executive and administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...

This is the kitchen.

No, Marty, please...

We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.

You got an elevator in this house?

Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?

Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.

I'm just here with another girl.

Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.

It's loaded with what?

Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.

So I'll die without a son.

Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.

She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.

What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.

Don't bring her to the house no more.

I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...

That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.

No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor. They moved to Detroit last year. And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, that was a big affair. Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. How's that with you?

When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.

Sure.

I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.

He coming home right now.

Sure.

On accounta...

Tommy...

Wadda you so sore about?

Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!

What do you want me to do?

You boys'll have to go to work early.

Stop him! Stop that man!

Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?

Where?

Which hospital?

Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?

She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.

Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.

Y'all mind the store.

Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?

You  must  open  me  up  again?

I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...

My name's Hawkeye Pierce.

You got directions?

Crabapple Cove. Maine.

Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?

Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?

Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.

Y'all just act natural.

Where the hell we going to get us a football team?

Look at the size of those two beasts.

Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.

Any time. Whenever we want.

There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.

Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.

You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.

The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!

And there it is.

Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.

I think I heard about that.

...But I turned in my knee pads.

It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.

But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.

Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.

If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.

Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.

It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.

It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?

Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.

Major Burns is far from satisfied.

Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.

Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.

I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.

I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.

Dear, sweet Hawkeye.

How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?

Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.

You're asking for somebody else?

He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.

It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.

It was really nice of you to take me along.

You really say the cutest things.

Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!

You don't go after the local scrunch?

Why can't you look at him?

What's wrong with him?

Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.

Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?

Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.

Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.

About that chest-cutter...

O'Reilly!

Sir?

To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.

Sir?

Can you make out what they're talking about?

Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?

Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.

Never mind.

Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?

Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.

Against anything. Just protest.

Yes!

Can I help you pack?

Do you care if I sit down out here?

You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.

But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .

Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.

. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?

Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.

Devoted entirely to the interests of all the John Does all over the country. Which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. He will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. A man whom he, personally, recommends. A great humanitarian; the best friend the John Does have.

That's good.

The Websters!

Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!

That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!

The letter from John Doe.

Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?

That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!

I can read. I can read!

Yes.  What's he doing here?

Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterdayhere he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!

Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!

Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.

Where's Connell?

No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!

Baseball?

I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy

Who's got him?

And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.

Sure, you are.

Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.

I gotta figure some way out of this thing!

Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.

Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.

Join the John Doe Club.

I trust him.

Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown.

Now, that's all right, isn't it?

Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!

I want it as soon as possible.

Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.

Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and

How about family? Got any family?

Oh, just traveling through, huh?

Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!

What difference does that make?

No, I didn't write it, but

Oh!

Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!

Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.

Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.

I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.

This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.

Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.

Who is it?

Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.

You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.

Don't make do it, Mike.

I hate fucking Springfield.

What?!

Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.

We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?

And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.

I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?

Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.

Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?

What's the point of this?

You don't like New York?

She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.

No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.

You think you can learn, McCall?

I can't do that.

If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.

What's the first commandment?

To save lives.

What did you see?

So what do you want?... An autograph.

To run last?

He's got the girl.

You're crazy.

How many have you lost?

And what if you can't live with it?

Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?

Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.

Is the hostage injured?

Something I guess I can't have anymore.

It's already started.

Yeah?

I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.

Stay up there, Girl...

What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?

Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?

I can't do that.

What have you promised them?

What do you need?

They have nothing to do with this --

You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --

She said I have a son...

How come I can't remember?

Why --

This is how you pick up women --

You were the one who was dying.

Where you plugged-in from?

What?

What's her name?

He had access to the keys --

One condition.

What is it?

A hotel?

Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.

Then you had her killed.

An interface attendant.

What brings you inside?

Then how do you know about --

We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --

You said we were on the same programming team.

To see how long it would take for me to realize.

What?

I wasn't with you.

But you were with me.

Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?

Access granted.  Male or female?

It's passing over earth as we speak!  Trajectory coordinates are 009843.

It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.

Is this... food!

I heard that!

We've come all this way for a rock wall?!

To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.

Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!

... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers...

PTERODACTYL!

... Not bad.

Let's go after him!!

FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!

It's... an eagle?

Just shut your gap!

I'm outta here.

But boss, what about their parents?

What!

Mordant, go with them and report back to me!

Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!

Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.

I am the mighty ape!

I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.

We're asking you to go to prison.

So Chicago's been good to ya.

I had everything. Once.

And now you have everything.

When my money moves, I go with it.

Four-twenty-eight.

Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.

Masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. But his patience won't hold out much longer.

Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?

A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.

Well...

Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.

You got something to hide?

A lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. I'm sorry you got hit by it.

Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?

Julius Caesar never took no vote.

Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.

I'll handle the Boss.

After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.

Why's it gotta be Tommy!

We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.

I'm glad ya come.

This business is about taking risks.

You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.

Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.

Not stupid. Fat.

Then perhaps you need to know me.

Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.

You get fifteen percent.

If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.

Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.

Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.

The Big Picture.

So we're gonna knock 'em both off?

Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.

Anything ain't a very hard number.

You're fuckin' crazy.

Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.

I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.

If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.

DEATH!!

Hey. Where's Monkeybone?

Death! Thank you!

Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...

Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.

Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.

Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?

Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?

Look at this! He won't let us leave!

I might wake up.

How was it? I don't recall.

Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...

Don't ask where I got it.

Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?

He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.

It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?

Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.

Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.

I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?

How are you doing sweetheart?

You know ...  ... whoops!

He seemed quite taken with you.

What's wrong?

You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.

Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?

I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?

Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?

Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.

Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.

The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.

I'll take your hat into the cloak room.

--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!

And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?

You've never *seen* this contract.

But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?

You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?

Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.

What's he bringing pigeons for?

Positively not in the station! Gone!

How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!

What's this, Diz?

Will you go chase an ambulance!

Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?

Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.

Ah. One of the supporting characters.

Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--

Why do I always laugh at that?

Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--

Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?

Any time.

You know, we're getting married.

He's cooked! They'll drum the poor lug out of that chamber tomorrow as sure as I'm--! And now they're all down on him. Yeah--my press pals, too--he's a bad egg--still water running deep. Boloney! It's the frame of all time! When I see a phoney like this--my journalist blood boils-- I wanna *fight*!  Look, kid--rack your brains, will you? Haven't you got any confidential stuff on that mob? I'll write my arm off--I'll blow Taylor and his--

Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--

Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?

Yes, Joe, yes--right away. 

Taylor, my dear.

Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.

Oh--oh.

I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!

--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!

But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--

What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?

A dirty frame!

Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--

Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?

All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--

Uh--Senator--I thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.

Ma's told me about it a thousand times.

Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--

But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--

Y-yes.

I have no defense against forged papers and--

Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--

Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--

But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--

Can't you?

Is--is something the matter?

--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--

Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.

Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?

A *day*!

Pardon?

I did--and--and I got right up.

On paper?

You mean--here?

I know. It's--Violet.

Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--

Well--no. I didn't. Why?

Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.

I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!

Yay!

Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!

A camp! Well!

It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.

Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.

"I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."

The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.

The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?

However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--

Since the time of Adams--not Washington.

Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--

Marvelous! And what would this camp set the Government back?

What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?

You can't find it in racing forms, Chick.

Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--

--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!

That's right.

Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--

All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!

You can't say *that* to--

Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!

Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.

How nice.

Father--oh.

That's going to be fun.

I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?

Most every day.

Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.

Oh, yes.

Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?

You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?

And you saw them happen?

You fainted.

Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.

What?

You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?

There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.

To most people, it's an awful letdown.

I say, to most people it's a washout.

Now, what do you see?

There's Times Square.

You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.

You said I was a lady in distress.

Yeah, I know.

Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?

"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.

The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.

Hello, Mary?

You're a fool, Babe.

What'll I tell him if he calls up?

You're acting like a school girl.

Did it?

You're a genius, Babe - a genius!

Come on, come on!

don't want to be critical, John, but here it is

Who? Miss Dawson?

Fourteen carat?

Is that the best you've got?

He's not home, I tell you!

Thank heaven.

The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.

Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.

But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.

I can understand that.  We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later.  Goodbye and thank you.

Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.

Are your parents living?

Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.

No?

Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.

Why not? Who is he?

He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.

Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?

Oh, it'll do in a pinch.

I've got one for Cobb

You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]

That's funny. Why is that?

Women! Ever heard of 'em?

Arthur! Who's Arthur?

And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.

I don't remember. "Cinderella Man!" What do they mean by that?

I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.

Yes, I guess I'll have to.

You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?

Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.

We provide opera.

That's impossible. The opera has never paid.

The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!

Why not?

Yes, sir.

I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.

Why, I turned them down, naturally.

Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.

I say we don't want to appear greedy.

Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.

Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.

There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.

No.

Your Honor

Proceed.

Huh? On, no. Nobody important.

Uh-huh.

Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?

New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?

How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?

Where is your farm?

South Dakota - north?

Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?

Tails tonight, sir?

A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]

Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?

What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.

That's what the two policemen said, sir.

Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.

Me, sir?

But she isn't due for an hour, sir.

Why are they ganging up against me?

It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.

Dr. Mumford.

But you do therapy?

...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.

Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.

Why not?

I was... never satisfied.

-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --

What brought this on?

Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.

Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.

...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?

So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?

That's a lot of people all at once.

Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.

So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?

How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.

Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.

-- you crazy? You can't do this!

Don't you at least have a back door I can use?

Got a license?  But no car?

I been drivin' since I was twelve.

What's wrong with her?

Well... you see, the problem is --

No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.

Even if you don't think it's real?

What would you do?

I don't know. I barely made it today.

Is that the technical description of what I've got?

Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.

I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.

Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?

No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.

You're doing great.

...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.

Why'd you come to the house the other night?

Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.

First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.

Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.

...How violated I feel?

You feel violated?

I am irate!

But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.

Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.

Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?

She's probably ten years older than you.

Well, there's Lily.

Amazing.

What?

How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.

You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?

All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.

A doll?

Sounds like kind of a good idea.

Damn! What is your name?

I've told you a lot of private stuff.

But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.

-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?

And the drugs?

I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.

I know it starts with a birth certificate...

What about it?

It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.

Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.

You know where he's taking her?

And how does one do that?

Now go find me a big stick.

How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?

O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!

Goin' somewhere?

C'mon, friend.

Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?

Immune from what?

I'm sorry, it was an accident.

You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.

She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.

Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.

I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.

See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!

I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!

You bastards!

The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.

And what is he in prison for?

Where are they taking him?

I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.

Fifty percent.

Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.

You know your history.

Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?

You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!

But he's just a filthy criminal?

I found it, Evy! I found it

I can't believe the price of these fleabags.

You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.

Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.

He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.

We gotta get her back.

I knew you'd know.

But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?

Everything's going exactly as we planned.

Our guests are waiting.

You two timing psychotic bastard.

We didn't think this through very well.

He was the last time I saw him.

Much less go outside.

Come on, baby!

Atta, girl!

How about... the Savage Six?

But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.

But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --

Hey... Can I buy you a beer?

Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!

But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.

Superheroes.

I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?

Are you with me... or against me?

And the light goes out...

I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".

Then why are you here?

Or talk?

Hi.

I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.

Bye. 

Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --

And it would be the right thing to do.

Have you ever seen him?

You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!

So what else has Superman got?

This place is built like a fortress.

We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!

Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 

Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.

Agents?

So you're like... struggling superheroes?

What are you doing in the silver drawer?

It's on the television.

Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!

Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?

It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.

Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.

I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.

The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.

And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.

Ah -- you approve?

Please...

To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.

The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.

I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.

But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?

But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?

She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!

Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?

You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.

Yes, sir?

Hello there, Picart.

A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.

Does your mother know you have come?

But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...

The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?

Then what brings you out on such a night?

Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.

That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?

Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?

Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.

The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts.

The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.

It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.

Ah, that is good.

Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.

Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?

Were they pretty?

Promise.

Separate bedrooms?

Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.

God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?

Why did you give it to him?

Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?

I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.

Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.

I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.

May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.

If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?

Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.

Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.

Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.

What did you say his name was?

Is he alone?

Come in.

He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.

I know Alexander.  His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland.

Well, let me in.

Y'all never use it?

Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?

No.  Thought he was with you.

Who are you?

What you mean talk to her?

For sure.  That's how I like 'em.

Man, Day-Day is my people!

You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion.

This you?

I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!

Damn, you got a stalker.

You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?

How can they do this?

I ain't trying to get in it.

Blow.

How you know?  It could be anything.

You go first.

Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.

You sure you don't wanna stay?

To the Cucamonga shopping center.

Hello, remember me?

You did all this for me?

Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.

Next time, page me first.

Can I help you?

I don't play for no team.

What is it?

What it smell like?

Craig, remember what I told you.

Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.

My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?

I can't get jiggy with this shit.  Where is the damn manager?

I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.

I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.

Roach...Roach, come on.

Get 'em, Craig!

Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.

If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call.

I thought you were taking me to see Mama?

You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.

Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.

Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.

Elroy, what happen?

All right, I'll do it.

Business or pleasure?

'S okay. What do you think?

Somebody close?

I have a problem.

There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.

For what?

Can we go now?

Daddy?

You're out of your mind.

How should I...?

I killed you.

My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.

Yes, you're right, I don't understand.

The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.

All right. Kisses to you.

You got anything smaller?

Mister, what are you dragging me into?

This gorilla's watching you, is that right?

Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.

I don't have to pay you nothin'.

Fuckin' A.

You stole that.

He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.

That's pretty good.

You have, huh?

You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  Do it.

Come Back.

Where's your Mom?

..."and I won't never tell about the money."

Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?

Do you mind me cussin', boy?

Where's Ruby?

AAA-MENN!

See ye got two more peeps to your brood.

Plan on a longer visit next time.

Icey, I'm worried about Willa.

I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.

Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.

What's wrong, Mother?

That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.

My, that fudge smells yummy!

Amen! Amen!

Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.

Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!

Tell me a story, John.

Where's Mom?

If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.

John?

Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!

Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!

Don't you hurt her!

John, where's your folks?

Story, honey? Why, what story?

Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.

What are you doing, boy?

Now: Where?

Yes; John's bad.

O no! Your turn!

Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?

She'll come draggin' her tail back home.

John: take that look offen your face and act nice.

John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.

You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?

Do you want more children, Willa?

You were listening outside the parlor window.

Mornin', ladies.

Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.

What do you want?

Pearl and John!

You'll whip me!

Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.

They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.

Oh my god, oh my god...

It's just a stupid cat.

You okay?

Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.

And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?

The killer.

You crazy? Hit him with what?

Dad -- what you doing here?

Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.

That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.

Tell her I'm not here, tell her...

Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.

Maybe god's punishing us all...

Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.

What?

You okay?

What's with the bars?

We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.

The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.

I never touched her.

No.

What you dream?

What the hell you doing here?

No more fights?

Thank you, Comrade.

Bring me forty-five back.

I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?

Ever since you have been back from Paris...

When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.

You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.

It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.

An evening gown.

You want this?

No, that's not him...

Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.

If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?

Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.

Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.

That must be the one!

And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!

You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.

Let's be happy that we're all alive.

May I ask how much your rooms are?

This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.

There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.

And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."

Guest?

Count d'Algout is still asleep.

Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.

Good evening, Gaston.

Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...

Your breakfast, monsieur.

I am, Gaston.

Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?

They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.

You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?

General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.

They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in -- a French maid.

Let's do that.

Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?

And if we have to go to Siberia...

She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.

Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.

A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move our things to the smallest room you've got.

Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!

He is a porter. He wants to carry them.

Allow me, Comrade.

We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.

I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.

The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.

Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.

I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...

That's two weeks from Thursday...

Give me another double brandy.

What can I do about it?

Don't hold that against me... please!

That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...

Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!

Yes. Could you give me some information?

Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...

Why do you need my finger?

You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?

I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.

Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.

Does that mean that you want me to go there?

Then you don't want me to go there.

Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?

I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.

You are something we do not have in Russia.

It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...

Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!

Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?

I have never heard one.

Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?

Did you make any change in this room?

It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.

Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.

Go on.

Comrades! Comrades!

But, darling, you can't do that.

Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.

Not white, darling.

Our salute will be a kiss.

Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.

Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?

First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?

Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?

Is anything wrong? Are you ill?

Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.

All right, I'll listen.

Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?

Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.

You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.

That's all right... I grow on people.

Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.

Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.

Unfortunately.

I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.

Here, please...

Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?

Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.

You want me to go to Constantinople?

I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.

How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.

At Père Mathieu's.

It's just a place for workmen.

We could check the tape again, sir.

For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!

So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.

He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.

How much do you need?

I'm still not confident we can ride through this.  Some people are going to have to go to jail.  Hunt's not the only problem.  Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments.  Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh, I think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses.

Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...

I agree it's ridiculous but --

He's right.  Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John.  A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate.  What do we have to hide?

I understand that, sir.

The President would like to know if that was the last payment.

It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.

He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.

I think he means the Kennedy assassination.

Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.

McCord? ...

I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again. 

And?

This is not a joke, John!

No, you didn't, Bob.

I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.

No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.

It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!

Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!

"Victory at Sea," Al ... Henry.  The Pacific Theatre.  Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks.

Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."

We can't survive this, sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.

Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --

... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...

Fucking hell.

But what are we paying him for?

Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...

We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.

This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.

I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...

He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.

There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...

Mr. President!

She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ...

You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.

Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.

It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.

What'd he say?

Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.

I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ...

Not if I give you all the cards ...

It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.

Are you tapping Kissinger?

Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.

This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.

Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.

... little Bobby.

Ummm...

It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.

Oh, my goodness ...

The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.

Kissinger?

This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.

You're fucking me.

Where'd you find him?

Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.

Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?!

Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...

Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far.

Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry.  When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react?  Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?

If they harass you, I, too, will resign.  And I will tell the world why.

... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.

He was a politician.

I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...

You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.

What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?

And Dick beat the shit out of them.

It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.

Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.

You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.

Jesus Christ!

But it was all we had.

That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...

... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...

We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.

We got the press this time!

Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.

And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!

We lost ...

You're not a failure, Dick.

Don't you want to listen to Brown's victory speech?

I'll concede in the morning.

Yeah ... I'm out.

Dick, you should call Bobby.

They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.

He looked old, didn't he?

Won or lost?

Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...

How'd you know I was here.

You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?

What would you a done if he'd been released?

Yes.

...I don't know what I do feel like.

Well what would you call him.

Hard to believe.

Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.

Who's he in trouble with then?

Yes ma'am, I do.

Well. Old age flattens a man.

Probably must be.

Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?

Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.

Yessir.

You gonna drive out there?

How's that, Sheriff?

When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.

No.

...Where'd you get the pistol?

I need to know that.

...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.

Not we, you. Stay with your mother.

Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.

Why all the way to Del Rio?

I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.

What should I do?

What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?

Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.

What's that.

Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?

Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?

Hello?

Huh? What is...

...You getting anything on this?

How'd you find it?

What airport would you use.

Airport.

...You need to talk to me.

...Me?

How much?

...Will there be somethin' else?

Is somethin' wrong?

...What time do you go to bed.

This was my wife's father's place. Originally.

Call it.

Just call it.

Look... I got to know what I stand to win.

Tent poles.

You already have the tent?

One room, one night.

Good. I need everything else.

You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?

...Keep going. Don't stop.

Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.

November the 28th, last year.

Yessir.

Okay.

...I'm wondering...

You tell me the option.

...You pick the option with the applicable rate.

That's me.

Then you'll like me.

...But that won't last.

...What do you do?

What did you do?

I don't mean braze.

Why would he go to Odessa?

The heroin. You don't have it.

Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?

Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?

I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?

IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!

Sheriff, I don't...

I thought you said the eggs weren't...

Bad idea...

I questioned Joyce about all this...

You're lying!

What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?

Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!

Need something else?

Great. Good. Content...

You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?

So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?

Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.

Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.

You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?

I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...

No... what about your sister?

All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?

Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.

...of course you do.  You don't remember me?

You never gave us a chance...

I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...

Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?

For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.

I don't think your friend likes me.

Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...

David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?

Why are you doing this to me?

Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.

I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!

I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --

Sure you don't want any salad?

Yes.

You're in serious danger!

What's the matter here?

If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.

I left my husband two days ago.

No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.

I got this apartment with a guy.

It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.

Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?

You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.

...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.

Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?

Does he know you think he's real?

No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?

Your husband?!

I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.

What can I do for you, gentlemen?

The fuck you talking about?

You did not just say "Injuns," Del.

Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?

Hey... you got a fine one right here!

Relax, we brought the cash.

That is so right.

Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.

Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.

Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...

We should go.

"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?

Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?

You need to remember who you're talking to...

Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!

What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?

I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.

If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.

But she wanted more out of life, right?

I see.  May I?

What'd you get her?

Seems like a nice place.

Jesus Christ!

She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.

I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?

It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!

Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.

You're wastin' your time, Roy.

Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.

No... before that.

What did you say?

No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?

So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?

Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?

You lie, motherfucker...

Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?

Her show?

Waitaminute -

We ain't gonna make it walkin'.

I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.

NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!

This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.

Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!

Whuhh...

Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?

A miracle! It was a miracle!

Latch right on to that tit.

Helluva idea.

Vernon Waldrip.

Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.

McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.

It's just a symbol, honey -

That's not my ring.

That's not my ring.

I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.

Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?

Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!

Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!

To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.

So I borrowed it till I did know!

A million dollars.

The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!

...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...

Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...

Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil!

Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!

How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?

You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.

Come back here, kid!

Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!

So what're you doing in Seattle?

You... in the Navy?

Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?

Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --

That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.

Go on, Zack! Go for the record!

When did this happen?

Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?

What's your name, boy?

Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.

What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.

I know.

What did you call me, boy?

You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?

No, sir!

Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.

What did you call me, Mayo?

I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...

Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...

By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?

How late?

But... but what would we do? Where would we go?

That was you guys, huh?

Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.

You serious about having him over?

You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?

What did you tell him about the baby?

And you turned him down??

You got a girl?

Yeah? Why're you here?

Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.

There's always a choice.

I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!

You stayed after all.

Want me to get a towel?

The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.

I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.

Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?

Hi.

I'm looking for Sid.

Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.

I'd like to come with you.

Yeah. You got the whole story just right.

I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.

You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.

What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?

Thanks for covering for me.

Sid, what happened?

Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!

You're fuckin' A we can do this.

What if she called the cops?

Are you okay?

That's your problem.

Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.

The walls are steel, right?

Fuck!

Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!

It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.

I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.

Open it.

They're coughing.

May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?

I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.

I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.

Oh, I've seen these...

Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!

Push that button for me, will you?

Watch your mouth.

Cut it back a little bit.

Makes me nervous.

What?!

Why did the chicken cross the road?

YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!

YOU HAVE TO!

Got him!

Why?

Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?

Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.

Where is the Glucogen?

Uhh... I with it sister but...

Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?

What are you doing with the gun?

Well... is it loaded?

What's up?

...The police report says he was shot three times but the coroner's report says quite clearly that Denzil Dowell was shot six times. And two of those shots were in his armpits. Brothers and Sisters you know why that is?  Because Denzil had his hands up!!

What the fuck?

I can't... they don't operate that way...

Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?

Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is.

Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.

I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.

Motherfucker... you stay away...

...Glad you came man.

Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.

I don't think that will be any problem...

Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?

Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.

That's right brother... listen and learn.

Yeah man, but where's Judge?

Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?

I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?

Man, this shit's pretty thick.

Huh?

Sorry man...

Fuck is up?!

You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that.

Yeah.

I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.

When?

Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?

Cheerful news to greet the morn.

Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.

He shouldn't make light.  That Redcoat should not have been killed.

I know him well enough?

And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.

Goodbye, Charlotte.

What unit?

Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.

I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.

First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.

Thank you.

That is a separate issue.

Very well, let us move on to...

It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.

Do you see that, Colonel?

Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.

The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...

Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.

We'd cover more ground if we split up.

And, Corporal...  ... be careful.

How old are you?

Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.

Gabriel?  Are you asleep?

Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.

Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?

Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?

An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?

Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.

Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.

Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...

Where is he now?

And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.

The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.

Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.

They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.

His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.

Goodbye, Francis.

Your son, what did you name him?

Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.

Yes, quite, but you should know that...

Reverend.

Thank you.

How many came back?

Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...

Gray.

Seventeen.

Put those away.

Who might you be, little Miss?

But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?

Yes, but the rope might be--

I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!

Please hurry.

That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.

Because you promised.

Huh?

Ellie--

Do you swear?

No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.

What were you listening to?

You folks ready to go on?

Not yet...how much further is it?

My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.

Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?

Going to tell Ellie?

But--

Yes, but--

I'm not climbing that.

It's funny, all right.

The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.

You want to rest a bit before you start?

What are those for?

Doesn't look like they last long.

Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?

Rachel not feeling well?

Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?

--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.

I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--

Leave me alone!

Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.

Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.

I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.

That boat is my livelihood!

What's in your head, boy?

Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.

The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?

I'll watch my back.

The situation has changed.

There's ... another exit?

So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?

My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?

There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?

I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'

Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.

Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.

I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.

Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.

No.  The pirates have taken Will --

I could never forget it, Miss Swann.

I'm glad we got here in time.

If I had known --

Come on!

So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?

You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.

Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.

Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...

Why?

Say again?

Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?

How did you get off the island?

How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?

It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.

Dead serious.

None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.

Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?

You would do that?

You cheated.

Move away.

Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?

Because you're a pirate.

Not without my effects.

This is either crazy, or brilliant.

Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.

I swear, you look just like him.

Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.

Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!

Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --

Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?

You haven't seen it.

He's still breathing.

Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.

How long do you leave him in there?

Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that.

Pollution?

What are you going to do to him?

What did you use?

She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.

Gently, Ott.  Gently.

You know how I feel about you.  You know how much I need you.  How much I trust you.  I would do anything for you.

The fact is, that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up.

Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.

Yeah, I do!

Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!

Well, you got another problem.

You're afraid of him.

Yes?

When did you...?

I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going.

God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.

Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!

Why?

Susan!

Look at this!

Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!

Uh oh.  I remember that temper.

Did you go?

I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.

Daniel, just forget Argon.  Let's get out of here.  We'll find another way to stop the waste.

You're not going after Argon!

God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal.  Do you remember that?

You!  I remember you!

Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!

That's impossible.

Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.

Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --

Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?

Don't mind Mother.

I suppose you're going to print them?

Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff

Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?

What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot

Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house

Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?

Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now

Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.

Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.

Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?

Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.

Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I

and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.

You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.

Yale '21, I believe.

So, you see how silly that rumor is?

Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition.

How's that?

Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?

I bring a message from Garcia.

It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.

Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.

Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.

I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!

Look, I quit!

What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.

Why not?

Mr. Schuyler .

Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?

Did you take anything out of those pants?

And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it

Thanks, thanks.

Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.

Sure - I think so, Stew.

Well, I'll have to look someplace else.

They all consider me just as one of the boys.

I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.

Here you are.

Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about?

Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?

I think you'd better go.

Well, at best you might deny it.

She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.

Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony?

Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.

I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?

Come in, Joe. It's all right.

I'm sorry nobody could come.

Some bicarbonate - quick!

Double-strength!

Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousandand you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!

Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.

But I

Did you call, sir?

You try it.

Found no skeletons?

It's haunted just the same.

Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?

Yes sir.

I put blueberries in them just the way you like.

What goes on up at Lover's Lane?

You sure you want to know this?

Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.

Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?

Have you got any make up?

Wait.

Like a drum.

Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.

Oh yeah.

"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?

And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.

Did you do this?

Do you know that it's illegal?

You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.

Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.

It's not in ME.

How'd you know about the fire?

Hear your Dad got a new car.

Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!

Jen, listen ...

You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.

David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.

D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?

Yeah ...

And you're sure about this?

Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.

You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?

A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?

I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.

... Like Prince Charming.

No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."

Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.

... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...

Don't get upset.

I had nothing to do with that.

Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?

Because you're coming home.

How long do you think you've been here?

There's worse places.

There aren't any cheeseburgers.

You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.

No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...

Aren't you a little early?

What's wrong?

Yeah. TV busted?

Oh GOD ...

Well, I can't talk though --

Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?

What city?

Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?

Yes, indeed, yes I am.

Well I don't want to do something like that.

Yeah, but please don't do that.

I don't think I'm going to the party.

...please, I just don't want it....

Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.

You look nervous.

It's not cool?

-- do you think you'll ask her out?

Are you gonna do it?

Yeah I can't.

Goodbye.

Hey. What are you doing?

What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --

-- what are you talking about, come on --

Nothing.

No.

No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?

....no....

It doesn't matter.

Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.

It doesn't matter.

...yeah....well you have me now.

I'm fine. Who is this?

Not very late.

Me?

I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.

Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?

Are you telling me no?

They're not open yet?

Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?

Do you have brothers or sisters?

That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.

I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?

I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.

That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?

-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?

There's a better place for us to eat.

Yeah.

I don't freak out very often.

Yeah?

HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?

Do you wanna have sex?

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

No.

I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.

It's just for verification through the credit card company.

It's ok, take your time.

I said calm down and shut the fuck up. What's your problem?

How many sisters do you have?

Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.

Hey, good morning, Barry.

Yeah.....you got here early huh?

Why is it here? Barry....Barry?

Good morning, Barry....

No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.

You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?

....now: this pudding?

It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.

They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...

Seven o'clock.

I know.

I know.

Ok.

That's it.

What's the problem?

What did you say?

He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --

It's not bad, it's ok.

I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?

So...did my brother call you?

I'll just see you when you get back here.

I don't believe it. The Marquis de Sade? You're actually publishing his novels?

Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.

"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"

Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.

"With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"

Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?

Has he hurt you?

Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.

Go back to your room. Quickly.

Don't come back, not tonight, not again --

Free his mouth.

Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?

Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --

Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?

There I was taxed; it's true.

It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?

Mightier than the sword indeed.

You mean to take us all down with you?

I have a proposition.

That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --

OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!

I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!

Don't confuse one organ with another --

Go to hell!

I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --

I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?

Surely you'll grant me a final word.

Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --

You have to believe me, I had no idea --

You're a sentimental man.

And --?

He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --

My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.

How is the patient faring?

I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.

I'll pass the word on, then.

I'm only a laundress; not a detective.

It's a long story, this one.

The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.

Surely you've seen a man naked.

It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --

Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...

Don't toy with me, Doctor.

Doesn't that please you?

It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.

God, these parties are the worst

I did my best but, well, you know me

Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!

It's not really--

There's a different between want and

The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...

Why did we not know about this sooner?

Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?

I wanna see the picture today

What are movies about?

Nope.

But with compassion and insight--

Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.

Mank-

Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.

Fuck you

Fuck you--

The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.

Cain -- like the Bible guy?

Jesus Christ --

Hey, kid. Gregg.

They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.

Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!

Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.

You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.

"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.

Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-

It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--

How 'bout a real drink?

He's Christ?

You want to do the life of Jesus?

Let's go, Jake, wake up!

Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.

I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.

Believe what you want.

Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.

J.R., glad you could make it.

Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?

You know?

You want me to do what?

And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.

Go 'head.

Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.

You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.

Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.

Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.

What?

Did you ever fuck my wife?

I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.

I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.

Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!

It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.

Nine o'clock.

You go first. Let me watch how to do this.

I can't find my ball.

Can you see it?

Take off my pants.

I was just...

I went out.

Where you been all day?

I called. You weren't there.

You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.

Jake --

Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.

Vickie, open up. I need to come in.

What are you doing?

But they don't have a case against you.

Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!

Hi, Tommy. How are you?

How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?

Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?

Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.

I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.

It don't look right.

Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?

This could go off in a month -- or an hour.

Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.

Name me a better photographer.

I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.

Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.

His wife took a trip.

I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?

If possible -- both.

Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!

A detective's nightmare.

One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!

Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!

Jewelry?

Did you ever own a saw?

Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.

Jefferies.

My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.

Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.

That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.

Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?

Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.

Read some good books.

It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.

For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.

That's abnormal.

Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.

Her father loading up the shotgun?

The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.

Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.

When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.

Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.

Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?

Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you.

Huh?

I'm just going to get the name of their truck!

You shouldn't have let her do that! If he ever --

When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?

Ten here.

Yes.

It is something really important, Jeff?

I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.

Goodnight, you idiot.

And your stomach?

Anything else bothering you?

You can't buy that kind of publicity.

I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.

Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.

Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.

Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?

Lisa, please!

What are you getting at?

That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.

Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.

Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.

What doesn't?

Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.

Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.

I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.

The same.

Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."

Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?

Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.

Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.

Shut up. I'm all right.

L. B. Jefferies.

Chelsea 2-5598.

What's happening?

What you say your name was?

We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?

How'd he get in?

That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.

Tell him why we moved here.

Yeah!  Shh!

Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?

Hey--I want to ask you something.

What would you do, Dad?

You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.

Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.

You sure?

I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.

Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?

Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.

I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!

Who's there?  Anyone there?

They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now.

Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?

You remember me?

Boy!

Are you really going to meet them?

What?

It's me!

We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?

I don't want you for my father!

You sure?

Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.

I'm sorry.

Sit down and eat--you'll be late.

'Bye, Mom.

What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.

Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.

Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?

Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?

You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?

That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.

A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.

If he could--

I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.

Hey!  That's enough static out of you.

Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.

"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.

See, I'm new.

They'll be looking for you.

No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?

I don't think you trust anybody, do you?

Why did you do that?

Where you going?

Oh, Jim!

Ever been in a place like this before?

I never felt so clean before.

After he tried to shoot you?

What makes you think he hates you, Judy?

That one?

Didn't you forget something?

IS THIS NICK MASON!!??

Gabriel, you promised!

Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...

Gabriel!

Toys for... adults?

Negative five?

Thought you wrote you had a mustache.

You need a COAT!

Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --

We'll have more fun in Detroit.

NO!

Get the hell off of me!

He'll kill you.

Your pen palls dead, lady.

...maybe I die for Nick...

He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --

And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?

We get to the bridge, we're all right!

I love you, Nick...

He wants to see your map.

How are we gonna do this, Nick?

Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.

WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!

What?

No, you can't --

Put him in the truck.

You're not Nick Mason...

What'd they call her in high school?

Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales --

They wouldn't have changed the security setup.

So what the hell good are you...

A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.

Start singing.

Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.

So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six.

No way.

No gun.

You gotta be kidding me.

You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --

Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.

I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.

What about the Powwow Safe?

Cancer-sucker.

I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?

Hell yeah. You work here long?

What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.

What about the money?

DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!

Hot chocolate.

Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...

She's using a new perfume.

Don't look like he missed the sunlight.

Tell Ashley... I...

Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?

Start talkin

Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.

He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.

Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.

Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.

Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.

I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?

Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.

The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."

He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.

Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?

Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...

The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.

The Brewers.

I can do that.

Let's go over it. Where are you?

How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?

Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?

Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.

But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.

When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.

He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.

Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.

So, talk.

Follow you where?

Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?

I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.

Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.

What's wrong with it?

Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?

I got the diamonds.

No shit?

Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.

He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.

Not these guys.

And that's more important than finding Lednov?

Yes, ma'am.

They won't be riding in the wagon.

I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.

She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.

But the rest is right.

He knows his alphabet.

Don't you trust me?

Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.

No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.

All my clothes --

Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.

That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?

Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.

That's right.

You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.

You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.

But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?

Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.

I've got eleven horses.

A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.

Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.

I can't take her with me.

You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.

Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?

You got no business snoopin' around --

What is it?

Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.

I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.

I suppose that's your wagon in the river.

Until you came along we were going to Sonora.

Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.

We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.

It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.

I tried my best, but these things take time.

Go on. Have another try at him.

We might as well start a fire.

-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?

Clay Phillips.

He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.

You're so nice.

Good night, Miss Wells.

U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?

What do they look like?

Well, Steve?

Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.

You don't know what it is to be sorry.

Goodnight.

Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.

No, I won't let you do it.

Me, too. 101?

And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.

Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.

Cindy, what's going on?

He's right. I should go first.

That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.

Buddy...

Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.

Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...

Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?

Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...

What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.

Better try a little higher.

Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...

Listen to me I --

What should we get?

No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.

Let her go, Cin.

Where's Shorty?

Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!

Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."

It was you...

Noooo!!!

Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.

Father!

Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.

Oh.

Am I cool now?

That was a great idea, Shorty.

I got it!

Got a problem with that?

Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.

I finished all the interviews.

Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.

That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.

My God! Is she dead?

I can do it myself.

Hello Dwight.

That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.

What if I wanted to borrow those keys?

She's right. We should stick together.

A little bit... Give me your belt.

You're not wearing a belt.

You mean to tell me we're dead!

No thanks.

Now you're being rude, Shorty.

Sorry, y'all. My bad.

This part removes the sense of humor.

...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!

Bring her home... I guess.

I wouldn't give ya a nickel.

Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.

Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 

Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?

That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?

I got somebody you could run over, Mother!

She's gonna kill Scotty!

Hi, Hank.

No woman would!

I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.

It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?

Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?

Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!

You bitch!

Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!

MOTHERFUCKER!!

Who wants fruit salad?

You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 

Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!

Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?

Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.

Certainly not!

I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!

Murder, honey.

Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee

I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.

You can't tell.

When I wanted to.

No.

I'll give you a check.

I haven't got that much in cash.

But tell me --

Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.

Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village -	"The Dante."

She's a pretty good sort.

The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.

What did she want?

And that was all?

A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her - something you never get hold of - something that keeps a man following after her.

The important thing is, the police won't believe you.

Yes, of course  but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.

I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.

You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.

It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.

Please - I can't explain things like this to your right ear.

She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.

Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.

That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here -

I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you - you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister  whom I had lost and have found again....   

Well?

All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?

Let her know what?

And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.

I'm tired of being afraid - of waiting.

Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.

At least you knew about Dr. Judd.

It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.

I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --

My window - - through which I see the world.

And you believe that?

Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.

Where is Jacqueline Gibson?

Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.

And this poetry  like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?

Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish  to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous.

It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.

Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.

I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.

I'd hardly describe It that way - The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.

I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice  that's it, isn't it?

Are we?	I thought I was very gay.

I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.

This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it  your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?

I didn't know.

There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?

I'm afraid not.

Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.

I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.

You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.

Oh, I like it. I like it very much.

Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.

That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.

Mother, father, sister.

Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.

Would you mind?

Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.

I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with.

You are?

Well... are you self-conscious about it?

Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?

Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?

So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.

It's a personal project I'm working on.

Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.

Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.

Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.

No.

What... what are these interviews about?

Like what?

This is just... so...

How did you know?

Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.

I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...

About me?

Can't.

Her name was Elizabeth.

Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?

No, you're not.

But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.

I can't.

Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?

That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.

Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.

Yes. I just got busy.

Something wrong?

For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.

Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.

I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.

You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't.

Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.

What upsets you about that?

Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?

No, he left last week.

Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?

I say it because it's descriptive.

I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.

"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?

Well, I'll call him when he does.

What are you talking about?

Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.

And what?

A card? For her fiftieth birthday?

I just thought it might --

No, it's nothing like that.

Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.

He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?

Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?

Here it is.

Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.

The extrovert.

How long will it take?

Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --

Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?

How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?

What did you think? Did it look like you expected?

Do you think I'm pretty?

No.

I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.

Hello.

Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.

Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.

Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.

Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?

Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.

Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.

No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.

Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!

Mr. Millaney?

Jesus!

So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?

I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.

Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?

Good shape for an old man, eh?

So who changes?

Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?

But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?

He didn't make it.

BREAKING OUT

How's Brad?

Is it because I'm becoming too popular?

When do I get to see Brad?

But...how?

Why Janet?

Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?

With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.

A free thinker.

Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...

Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.

A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.

Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.

SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT

I'll leave you young things to it.

I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE

SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EACH OTHER

SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT

I'd forgotten.

Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?

We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?

Could you tell us a little about it?

Vance!  Vance Parker.

I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME

You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!

F for...

HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.

It's you we're concerned about, Janet.

That's an extremely negative response.

This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.

HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...

I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.

How's the trip?

And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.

Are you there? Miles?

How's it hanging, Miles?

They're from both of us.

Yeah, well, you should be my agent.

Is it chicken?

How you doin' tonight, beautiful?

I'm thinking about the duck breast.

Anything I'd know?

I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.

Why did you tell them my book was being published?

What?

Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.

It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.

Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.

Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?

Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...

That's what you do with every one.

I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.

We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.

Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?

The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.

Have you no shame?

Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!

You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.

She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.

Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.

And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.

And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.

You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --

Later.

Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.

What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.

Call me on my cell if you go out.

Nice shot.

Huh.

What is it?

Fucker hit into us.

Is it the money thing?

I said okay?

Do you like them?

What's that supposed to mean?

Don't give up. You're going to make it.

Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?

No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.

So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.

We gotta go back.

Please, Miles, please.

She tell you she was married?

So what the fuck were you thinking?

Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...

Fuck you. I'll get it myself.

Come on, let me drive.

What the fuck!

What the fuck!

Look at this!

Well. That about does it.

Uh-uh. You're on your own.

This is good. Little hints of clove.

So what gems do you have in your collection?

The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.

I started to get serious about seven years ago.

So what's your novel about?

Oh. You mean... today?

So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?

Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.

You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?

About two-thirty.

Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...

Oh, Maya. No.

Where are you?

I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --

That was big of him.

Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.

So what do you think?

What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.

So what are you up to today, Miles?

What's wrong with the water next to your bed?

No.

Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?

Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.

The same windows.

Does it hurt?

...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.

And tell Merrill to swing away.

You do?

Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!

Explain, act crazy?

That roof is over ten feet high.

Pharmacy crowded?

It's noise.

Do you think it's a possibility?

For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?

This is going to do nothing.

He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.

Graham.

It needs batteries.

We might lose the signal.

Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?

It's the strangest thing Father.

Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.

Is anything missing?

Is he okay?

Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?

I think we lost 'em.

McKendrick's men got him.

The Parkers seem like nice folks.

I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.

Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.

Are you all right?

You must have known that before you came.

I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.

Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.

I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.

South of here, past Chimayo.

All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.

Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb.

That's a lie.

He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.

A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.

Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.

Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.

Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?

That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.

New record.

Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.

I don't like that word much, Carter.

He was murdered.

What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.

Get out. We have nothing to talk about.

Why him?

You got a place to stay?

I'm a great believer in doing nothing.

I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.

I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --

It's the only place I'm happy.

Is this a fair mix?

What makes you say that?

Some people think because they're stronger -- or meaner -- they can push you around. I've seen a lot of that. But it's only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it.

I've got a place I can hide her.

A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?

But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.

Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?

Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.

I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.

My God, are you alright, Simone?

We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.

Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.

No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!

Why not?

Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.

Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.

Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.

Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.

-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will.

The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.

She doesn't want pity.

She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?

Elaine, it's Wednesday.

That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.

-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.

Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.

Mom, do you miss Dad?

I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence.  Have you?

You look so, so...

Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.

Sure.  Where would you like to start?

And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.

You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.

There's... a wall between you --

-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.

Is she here?

You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.

-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --

-- Flesh is weak.

I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.

Hi, Dad.

Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.

How?

Okay, Dad.

So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?

It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".

-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.

-- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!

Do I know you?

So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.

I've done my homework.  I've studied her.

I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.

We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.

A lot's happened since we last saw each other.

You could play the lead.

Hi.

You did create me.

See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.

Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.

Why did you leave me?

What were they hiding from?

I forgot your name.

Where should I look then, Cole?

Know what?

I didn't know you were funny.

Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--

No.

I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.

...No.

Yes?

What do you want more than anything?

I have to.

You weren't a paper champion.

Something happened, didn't it?

I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.

What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?

I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?

She wanted me to tell you--

Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.

Stuttering Stanley!

The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.

I'd watch your step if I were you, son.

Could take a little while, though.

Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?

You have a strong unfufilled desire.

There's something weird going on here, Suzie.

Gene.

Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"

Curt Cobain.

Well, there goes our record deal.

Should we be doing this, dude?

"Old Macdonald... had --"

Joseph Macdonald... Your son.

Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?

You'll be back.

Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.

You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.

Is that right?

So?

We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?

You wouldn't understand.

You're... limping.

Listen to me --

The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...

What is it?!!

She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.

Second verse!

Carl.

Someone better tell Mac.

Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.

Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.

No reception out here.

Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.

What?

We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?

What's she see in that douchebag?

He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.

Where are you?!

Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.

Rorschach.

Looks like a chipmunk.

Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.

Where's the old half--Mexican?

Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.

Sure thing, killer.

Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --

That's not true -- Where are you--?

You're my princess, aren't you?

Who's that?

But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.

He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.

I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.

Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.

I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.

Driving, talking to me...

You know, you're not a bad driver.

You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.

Christ, what channel are we on?...

Hey...

Let's hit it.

Kate...

I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.

-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.

My very words.

What are you thinking?

I'm begging.

How long's this gonna take?

If I say go to two, it's really one.

Liquid gold.

You know how to drive one of these things?

I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey. I don't know what the sucker wants.

Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.

Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.

Bandit II?

Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.

Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.

When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?

Breaker. Breaker.

Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?

I think you're just yellow.

Oh, yeah. Good for him.

Is that Bandit in the lead?

Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?

Five thou.

But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?

He's giving them up?

No.

Did he give you his name?

You're sure?

And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --

Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.

But there were more of you?

What happened?

So I guess you're not going.

-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?

Do you want me to say I'm sorry?

-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --

Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...

A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.

On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.

It's the last place they'd look.

Where's Israel?

My debrief --

...A paternity suit, filed 1967...

...Does he know?

Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.

...When did you know all this?

...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?

I wouldn't go that far.

You're trying to save Sparazza?

...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...

Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.

Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --

-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --

Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.

That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?

No shit.

Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --

-- never in a million girl --

My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?

Why?

Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.

When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --

You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?

He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.

What'd you say?

Are you anywhere near the penthouse?

Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?

I DON'T KNOW!

Bulllllshit...

Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.

Where's his body?

That's fantastic.

She'll come back.

You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?

How long can you go without sleep?

I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?

It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.

Probably.

Kelvin, you awake?

If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?

Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.

She knows everything.  She knows who she is.

I don't know.  I can't be alone.

We're taking a flight?

I wasn't.

You want to fuck her?

You behave as though you want to fuck her.

Is it a planet?

What happened?

Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.

Why did you say those things?

Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?

You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.

Sartorius wants to destroy it.

What's wrong.

What are you talking about?

But we fought.

Why did she do it?

Was she right?

Do you want to stay here?

What's happening to us?

No.

Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.

It wouldn't have made any difference.

What do I have to do to stop it?

I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.

Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?

Is that really what you want?

You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --

It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.

I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God.  Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it.  It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that.  A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.  And us?  We would have to have "an arrangement".  An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How can I not hate something that does that?

They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.

A recoil, with no compensating mechanism.

Followed by non-human manifestations.

Looks a little constipated to me.

It's terrific Win.

I've never seen anyone killed before.

Right.  That's true.

I'm supposed to call in.

Put it on my account, please.

People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.

I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.

He said he'd kill me.

Claire?

You were reading my Renoir.

You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?

You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.

I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.

I don't know you...

Are you okay?

Where?

Claire...

Claire!

You still going away?

You're planning to speak?

Well, of course, we'd be... honored...

... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...

... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...

Keep what handy?

Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?

Hey, can we go to McDonald's?

Mike?

Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?

Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?

What did she say the down payment was?

Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.

It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.

C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?

He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.

I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?

What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.

Wasn't your fault.

Tell me I'm dreamin'.

... Hard?

I asked for the man in charge...

You should'a brought the girl.

Hold it...!

Why should she come in?

Bullshit!  Prove it.

Let my kid go.

Under the table.

Watch your step!

Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.

What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?

Well, look who's dressing for success.

And Flash isn't?

So, uh... how's college goin'?

You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.

"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."

"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."

You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?

How are you doing, kid?

Yeah--

Can we make it a hundred?

Can't focus...

Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--

I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--

Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.

Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."

You should write that one down.

This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?

You'd feel what?

May's much better. She'll be out soon.

Peter?

Hello, Liz.

Waldos.

Toxic dumps, huh.

Of course.

Aunt May, you're trespassing.

I am old enough to--

I'm a photographer, remember?

It's Friday night...

Absolutely no class.

Oh, Ben gets through everything.

Poison emergency.

Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--

Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.

A bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--

Really.  I'd like to speak with him.

I sent for  the police.  We can explain.

Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?

He'll try to finish his experiment.

A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.

I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...

Up here, Docky Ocky!

We made a deal with Barrack One.

Come on!

W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?

Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.

That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?

Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.

Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!

Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.

Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.

Then we're all in on it?

Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.

What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?

You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.

What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?

What some brandy?

105-353.

I'll live.

I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.

Ever try forty sleeping pills?

As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.

What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?

It is.

Interesting.

Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?

What is this? This is water?

Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!

Let me go! Let me go!

How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.

Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!

Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!

Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!

Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.

You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.

Says me.

You heard that, Sefton?

You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.

Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?

I'll kill you for that!

December seventh, forty-one.

The what?

Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.

Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.

Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?

That is my wife.

Is it all right if we smell it?

Have a nice time over there?

Toh-pak-cha=8A 

The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.

Target their Bridge.

Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.

But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...

Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.

Is she still angry?

But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?

What?

I don't see a control panel, or an access port.

We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.

Can you locate them?

We're within range, sir.

Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.

Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?

Well, may we have a look around?

What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.

Beautiful day, isn't it?

You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?

No, no, it's not. It's better.

Captain of the Enterprise, huh?

Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.

Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.

Keep her together until I get back.

What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?

We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.

Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.

Sir, is there anything wrong?

Maybe they're not out there.

I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.

Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.

It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.

Doctor Soran?

Nothing for me.  I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.

It looks like we're too late.

These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.

I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.

As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.

Mr. Chekov -- ?

Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.

Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.

I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.

Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.

Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.

Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!

My readings indicate great instability.

Saavik... My god, what happened to them?

How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!

It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?

I don't understand.

Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?

Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.

Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.

See! That shimmering area.

That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?

The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.

Gentlemen. Good evening.

Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!

Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?

Yours...?!

No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.

Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!

Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.

Then you know how bravely your son met his death.

I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!

What I have done, I had to do.

I ordered no interruptions.

We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.

1,000 Kellicams, closing!

My Lord... what are your orders?

Sir, may I --

We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --

Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.

Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!

But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...

Well -- what are we going to do about it?!

Uh -- what are they?

But I'm allergic to Retlax.

Say thank you.

Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.

Shore leave, Admiral.

It never rains but when it pours --

They even killed the galley chief.

But what if they went -- nowhere?

Until now.

You okay, Jim? How do you feel?

But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --

This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.

It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...

Does that about do it?

Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.

I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --

Don't tell me you've got something.

I told you! I told you I saw a --

A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --

Where's Dr. Marcus --

He's on a build up to detonation!

We encoded four minutes --

I didn't expect anything.

I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.

Let go -- he can't -- !

Steady on course. All systems normal.

They're requesting visual communications, sir.

Sir -- our shields are dropping!

Departing dark side, Regula.

Yours... is... the superior...

Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --

Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend...

Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.

Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?

On screen.

... No response, sir.

Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.

Midshipman, you're a tiger.

Mr. Scott, the word is given.

If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.

Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?

So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your protg's first rare -- a trifle emotional --

Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?

Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.

Gentlemen, this isn't --

One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.

Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...

You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...

A distinct possibility.

What IS working around here?

Kirk here.

Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...

Very well.

A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?

I did not think so.

May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?

Khan!

It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.

Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?

Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'

Time!

Admiral on the bridge!

Stop engines.

Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...

He's very human.

Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.

You lied.

I would accept that as an axiom.

Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.

I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.

And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --

Sorry if I spoke out of turn.

You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?

You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?

Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..

I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!

Oh, joy.

Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.

Wake up, man, wake up!

Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.

10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.

You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.

Naturally.  So what is your problem?

Guess, Spock. Your best guess.

What's your degree in, dentistry?

What's causing that!?

Find it?

Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...

All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?

Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.

Shields, Mr. Chekov.

"Neutralized?" How?

They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.

So you were at Berkeley.

Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?

Back to San Francisco.

There's really very little point in my trying to explain.

Memory problems, too.

All right. Who are you? and don't jerk me around any more. I want to know how you know that.

Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.

So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?

Sorry, the time would have to be right now.

I bet you're a damn good poker player.

Here... In the park?

It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.

Oh my God, we're too late!

You mean this is -- goodbye?

Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?

The late 20th Century.

Earth... But when?... Spock?

There is a 20th Century possibility.

As you observed, a primitive Culture.

Admiral, may I ask you a question?

Spock...

You've done it before. Can't you remember?

That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?

Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!

No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.

Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales.  Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?

Spock: Condition report!

Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...

Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...

What is our condition?

10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.

10 seconds, sir!

I have no control, sir!

Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.

We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?

Estimate range, ship to whales!

They're giving out. De-crystallizing.

I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...

Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...

Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?

I notice you're still working with polymers.

Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?

My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.

Deceive us?

There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.

Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.

There are days.

An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?

I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.

There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?

I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...

When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...

Mother and son. You arranged this...?

I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.

Won't he rust?

Will he live?

... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.

Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.

It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.

That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...

I'll order Riker to turn around.

We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...

You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?

What kind of concerns?

Captain, I wasn't expecting you.

... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...

With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?

It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?

We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation.  This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.

Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.

But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.

Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?

There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.

By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.

All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...

Full impulse.

If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.

That's your expert opinion?

The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...

The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.

Who is it?

... and gorgonzolla cheese.

Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...

Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...

The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.

Captain...

He's activated a transport inhibitor.

Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?

Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?

Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...

It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...

Why don't you try sitting up?

Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...

Initiate launch sequence.

This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?

The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?

Montana.  Energize.

Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?

What are we waiting for? Let's go.

He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.

You actually performed surgery...?

You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.

Yes...

But now... they are all one with the Borg.

No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.

"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?

This must be it.

Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.

Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?

We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.

Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...

The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.

Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.

What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.

Yes.

Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...

Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.

What?

I'd say you already have.

Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.

Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.

Life signs?

Port battery, ready sir!

Hull integrity down to thirty percent...

Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.

We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...

Captain?

Good luck, sir.

Return to our own time?

A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!

What are they doing?

And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.

Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!

Someone...?

Wil... Data was down there.

They're bypassing Engineering...

They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...

I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...

Uh, Jim...

Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...

Figures.

Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.

- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...

What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -

Damned clever if you ask me...

Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.

Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.

Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?

Too bad we can't SMELL her.

I was nervous -

I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.

What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?

They'll respect him now...

It takes a lot of effort.

Would you care to go topside?

My God, what happened here?

WHAT HAPPENED?

You were demoted...

For insubordination.

You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?

You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?

Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??

From Starfleet?

She's here - somewhere.

Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...

You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.

Aye, sir.

An INCIDENT?

Thank you, Captain.

And your coat.

How did you know...?

We don't get many presidential assassins.

Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?

I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.

I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.

Who is "US?"

This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.

I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.

The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.

Me?

What is it?

The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.

The peace conference.

I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.

Are you dining on worms?

Captain --

How did you - ?

Direct hit -

We can send a message to Starfleet Command -

I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --

I have confirmed the location, sir, but...

And if they're still in place?

They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.

Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...

You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?

Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.

They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.

Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?

Can you remember our father?

Indefinitely.

I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I dont show up for my physical on time!

He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.

And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?

Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.

My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.

Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.

Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander.

"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.

Yes.

But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.

How can you be sure?

Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.

We are being hailed.

Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.

Why am I looking at me?

Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. Id say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .

Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.

But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.

What is our approximate distance?

It appears to be...  ... an arm.

Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.

And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.

The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.

Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.

How can you be certain?

The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.

But how can he? He'll kill you.

You're not here.

No.

I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.



Open a channel.

You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now, Mister La Forge.

Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.

New Praetor?

I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.

Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.

To find the head, sir?

Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.

We're being hailed.

What's this?

It's working.

Not very chatty.

The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.

Anything.

I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?

On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.

I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.

No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?

You know I need to verify this.

Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.

With a full head of hair.

Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.

What are you doing?

Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe Ill snap its ugly head off.

And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?

Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.

It amazes me how little you know yourself.

I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.

Yes.

That's your life... not mine.

Its too late.

So theyve got him up and running.

Are we prepared?

Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.

The bond is broken.

No -- this is wasting time.

What is it?!! Focus on your job!!

Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?

You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guards whip and you'll soon understand patience.

Benny, there's nothing there.

What can I do for you folks?

Do you have a good map of Death Valley?

No!!! No!!!

Where did you stop last?

We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?

Recognize this?

I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...

None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...

Contain it and get back to me.

Then it's not an accident that they found us.

Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?

It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...

I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.

We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.

Mrs. Haydn...

I want to speak to Marc Shermin.

Please...

Ah... no...

Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...

What?

Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?

No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.

Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?

No gas.

Who?

Shit.

I...

I want to try it.

Sun...

I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...

You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?

The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...

I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...

Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...

'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'

Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.

Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?

Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?

Nobody knows.

I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?

I am not a good singer.

You liked my singing?

Are you angry at me?

Where are you going?

We're not going to get a ride tonight.

Good morning.

You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.

This is crazy. We don't have time for this.

The cook again?

It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...

Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.

Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?

Well...

Tell the baby about me.

They after you?

I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.

The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.

Is it for real?

Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.

Oh, Jesus.

Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...

Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.

I told you...

Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.

Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?

Yeah, that's right.

Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?

You said you were going to get her out of this.

Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.

Cut it out, Tran.

No.

Talk to me about costs, here.

Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?

Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.

Naw.  She won't call me.

You should feel like shit.

Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.

Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?

But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--

That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.

Jesus.

No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.

I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'

Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.

Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?

Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.

So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?

What's his name?

What the fuck are you doing?

Are we having a bad night?

I thought we were friends.

Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?

What's that?  Present from Faith?

No it doesn't.

Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?

How's Zander?

You better keep a low profile for a while.

Shit!

Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!

This is bad.

There's a plus side?

You see Tran?

Alright.  We're going up.

Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?

Are we under arrest?

Hey, Lenny.  We made it.

Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.

Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?

Testa?

Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?

Anybody talk to the press?

Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?

Hey, Sheriff.

The room key's in the car. On the seat.

You have the body?

I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?

We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.

Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.

Jesus.

Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.

What are you...?

How did you know he was a construction worker?

Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.

We have another one.

Deputy Director, get out, sir.

You refused to comply with a direct order.

Its called insubordination.

How do you feel, Agent

Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.

The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?

You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?

I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.

Why did you go to Chicago?

You didn't tell anyone where you were?

That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.

Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal.  The Agent died that night, killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon, the second man Richard killed.

We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.

You are so fucked up.

Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This is not hypothetical, this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.

None taken.

You work with Koessler?

Why did he come out here? What's going on?

Doesn't fit.

Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.

What about the chat rooms themselves?

Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."

People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.

I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.

Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her.

I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.

He's called a couple times.

Find the feet?

We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?

The tattoo?

I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.

There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.

My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.

You were right. He found me.

Who are you?

Agent Mackelway?

Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.

There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.

[Lionheart, what happened?]

I've been to Chicago.

Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.

I want to help you.

I want to go live with you.

I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?

"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?

Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?

I don't...

Speck is dead.

You should call your Grandmother.

Like the quiche?

Like what?

Anything?

You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?

Charles! What's up, man?

...and boy does it hurt when they ask.

...not until you book it...

I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".

It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.

Wait here, I'll get you that martini.

You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.

I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.

It's a rebound.

Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?

Well... This is it.

Me too.

I'll be around.

I'll have to come see you sometime.

Hello?

Lorraine?

Hi.

So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.

There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.

What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?

I didn't mention her once today.

You want to hit the town tonight?

What do you have? A Pluto call back?

How many strokes?

I'll give you an eight. 

Sounds more like Aids...

Kinda money, huh?

I'll get a Dewars rocks... 

...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.

Oh, like that song...

I got to at least try once.

Uuuuugh!

I think I'm gonna move Back East.

How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?

You miss the pain?

It's kinda money, actually.

...which means no one will get there 'til ten.

What's he do?

...It was six months, and she didn't dump...

Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 

There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.

Hello?

VEGAS.

Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.

I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.

I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.

Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?

Wake up, baby.

First let's see what happens if we play it cool.

The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.

Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.

You gotta do it.

Always, baby.

I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.

Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.

You think so?

She likes you.

I know. I know.

What was the part?

No!

Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.

Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.

Christy was nice...

She didn't like me, anyway.

I just don't think she liked me in that way.

Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.

I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.

I hear she's getting real fat.

No.

Who? Rob?

Oh, it's on, baby...

It's on.

...Anaheim...

This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.

But your daughter is still alive.

You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.

Godfather!

The word is out in the streets that he's dead.

Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.

You take care of Paulie?

Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.

We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.

Is it necessary?

He's his own boss, and very competent.

When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?

No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?

Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?

What was this for?

Have you thought about a wife?  A family?

I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.

No, I wanted other things for you.

You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.

Barzini will move against you first.

I know.

What is it?

Beautiful all over, eh?

It's the real Thunderbolt, then.

You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.

Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.

Is the hospital covered?

One of Tattaglia's people?

Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it.

Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.

Michael, what are those men doing?

Why do they bother him on a day like this?

Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.  They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.

Then Luca turned to the other man...

I never know when you're telling me the truth.

Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.

Michael.

Michael, what are you doing?

When will I see you again?

Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.

You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.

Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.

I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.

Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.

Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.

Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?

Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.

That's not how Pop would have played it.

All right, Sonny.  All right.

Where are you going?

A million times.

Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.

Let us fill up our Regimes.

Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.

The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.

You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.

Yeah.

I think so.  Detective squad?

Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.

Marge, you like everybody.

If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.

Okay.  And did we know each other?

Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.

It's just an undercoat. 

You know, a primer.

I'm intruding.

Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.

You like jazz!

Good afternoon!

I have to go to Venice.

The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.

Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?

You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.

Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.

Shoes too?

She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?

To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.

I've got plans!

I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?

I wanted to tell you my plan.

You love me and you're not marrying me.

What?

Dick -- you've got to hear this!

Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.

He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.

Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.

Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?

You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.

That ring's so great. The green one.

You really should go in, it's marvelous.

Are you okay?

How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?

He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.

Dickie?

Tom?

You've got Dickie's rings.

Marge? Where are you going?

I told you. He gave them to me.

I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --

Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!

No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.

What's funny?

You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?

Which is?

The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.

At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --

The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.

Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...

You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.

So -- are you travelling under R?

Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.

Will we see you later?

We'll be there.

My God.

That's good, isn't it?

In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.

Tell him I have a fiancée, Dickie has a fiancée and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.

He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?

Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?

Not guilty.

Do you want me to stick around?

Tom, are you okay?

Hello. What are you up to?

You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.

Why lie?

And don't forget. I have the key.

Dickie Greenleaf?

So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?

Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.

Was it? Did you speak to Tom?

I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.

Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?

You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?

You want to canvass?

Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.

I don't know...

Where do you live?

So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?

What kind of people?

What did you do?

The moon?

That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?

You must be rich.

That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 

I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.

You didn't have to spend your money -- ?

Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.

I see where Palantine got the nomination.

Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?

Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.

First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.

No, I didn't forget "sexy".

Oh, Tom, please.

Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?

How long has he been there?

Try holding the match like this.

No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.

Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?

First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.

First she did her make-up. You know, I hate it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge...

Yeah.

Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge..."

Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.

20 bucks?

What's your real name?

Do you understand why I came here?

Don't you want to go?

But that one night?

Can I see you again?

But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.

I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.

You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.

What should I do? Call the cops?

How?

What do you mean?

I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes.

Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?

How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?

I'm here to see Iris.

Wha -- ?

Get it.

Wiz?

Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...

Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.

John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....

Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...

I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?

What, vou?

Surprise, surprise.

I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.

You've got everything?

You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.

Did you bring along something to read?

Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!

I do?

I'm sorry.

Were we going to get married?

We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.

Nine hundred...

You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.

Now, did you remember that, or...

How do you tell those two apart, anyway?

It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.

Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.

Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.

Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?

Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?

Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.

Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?

Here we are.

No wallet, huh?

You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.

Wait'll you see the inside!

Why?

This is the staff of the Bijou.

And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?

Beautiful, wasn't it?

Luke... what time is it?

Jesus...

Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.

... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.

Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.

Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.

They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.

However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.

Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.

Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.

Why not?

I can play the piano?

Is there a young Tim?

Found me.

Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.  Hi, Cat.

T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.

Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?

They all know you?

Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist?

Yes?

Are you a friend of Mitch's?

Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?

It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?

Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?

That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?

Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?

San Francisco.

You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.

Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.

Then what was it?

Afraid you'd take Mitch?

It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?

Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.

Don't you like Bodega Bay?

Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.

Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?

Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.

What?

Good morning.

I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.

Where does he live?

And the white house?

The two kids?

The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?

You see, I wanted to surprise them.

It's a surprise, you see.

The little girl's name.

Are you sure?

Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.

One apple pie! You want more coffee?

Oh. I see.

Across at Brinkmeyer's.

There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.

Yes?

Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.

Maybe we ought to leave.

I don't know. We'll break up the furni...

Mitch...

We'll worry about that when we get there.

Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?

Why? Didn't Al believe my story?

Do you think Cathy's all right?

Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.

I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here. 

Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.

I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?

I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?

There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...

Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?

I understand completely, sir.

Doesn't what make me...?

Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.

What did you say?

But how... how do you know my name?

I don't know you.

What are you? A policeman?

Do you practice here?

To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.

After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.

Certainly, but...

I'm sure.

Why did he shoot her?

I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.

Without any clothes on?

The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...

...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...

And you didn't come up here to see her.

Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?

Do you expect me to believe...?

I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.

Really? Tell me about it.

And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!

No, no...

I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?

I think it's safe to get out now.

Do you want to try your father again? 

Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.

No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?

They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.

I don't know why.

Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...

Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.

How do you plan to do that?

Scotch, light on the water.

We need them.

Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.

I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.

Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?

Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.

You must leave this house.

Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.

Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.

You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.

There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.

Dr. MacFarlane --

Wilmont used up the last spinal section.

Yes, I suppose so.

Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.

Well --

We can't be sure of that.

I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.

Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --

I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.

Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.

Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --

Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.

What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?

I thought this was a school day.

You'll not need that again, Georgina.

He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.

I'm by way of being a medical myself.

It might be an interesting case.

Toddy hates me.

I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.

Have another glass of something good, Toddy.

Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --

But why, Gray? Why?

A pleasure to torment me?

Can anyone hear what we say?

You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?

Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?

I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.

You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?

I hate that picture.

Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.

Where is it? This place?

Sssshhh. She's resting.

One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.

Wrong. Answer.

Fucking Zombie.

I heard you were looking for this.

The scar. Which of you has it?

Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.

Yeah, no kidding.

And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?

Daisy. How did you know?

You killed that cop Dutton.

Are you ok?

No. You don't.

I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.

Fucking crow.

How about sign of a big black bird?

Just don't believe everything you see.

Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.

What's with your friend there?

Look, can I just call a cab?

Erin!

I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.

The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!

In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.

We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.

I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.

Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?

Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?  I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!

I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?

Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?

Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.

Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?

Sure. Right near where my mother works.

I thought that was only for bombs.

Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.

No foolin'? Will you?

Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.

All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.

What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?

The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs - heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.

Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.

It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.

The present situation?

I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--

I was only hoping to make you understand.

Perhaps if you could explain a little--

We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.

Your impatience is quite understandable.

It was a wonderful day.

I will be in just a minute.

I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.

I wonder if we ought to--

Are you crazy? After what happened today?

He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.

What happened?

Just twelve.

It must be twelve-thirty.

No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.

I was.

No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.

But how -- how long--?

How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?

Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.

You sure about that?

Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?

Well, how do I know who you are?

Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.

I don't like horror comics.

How do you like Santa Carla?

They wouldn't be out in the daytime.

The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.

Whattaya mean?

That's right.

So how do you like those maggots, Michael?

Where is she?!

Where's Star, David?!

Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.

Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.

I thought they'd be in coffins.

We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.

Of course not!

Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!

Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!

Are we havin' fun or what?

You didn't tell David?

Still mad at me?

Michael, are you still in bed?

-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.

Oh, no.  Now what?

What did you say?

Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.

There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --

So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.

But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?

Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.

Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?

This looks terrific, Lucy.

Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.

Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?

Does it burn?

Are you following me?

When?

Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!

Why not?

Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?

Did you spill something?

What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!

What??

No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.

How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?

Sure.  You think there's a connection?

Too damn dangerous.

... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!

Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.

Let's open it.

Let's open it.  Now...

I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...

Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.

Torch it over there!

I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.

Where's the other half?

What do we do about those three?

We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.

... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...

We should have jumped his ass.

Not the only one.

... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.

Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.

Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.

'Bout eighty kilos southwest.

Hey, man...!

Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...

We're on fire!

You're not thinking of going after them, are you?

Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...

How long's it been?

No it ain't there.  Would I be asking if it were there?

This storm do that?

Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...

Maybe it ain't coming.

Ah... no.

There's a place that might help... we could try going there.

I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.

Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.

... Well, you wanted to see it.

Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?

Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --

So, do we go on?

In for a penny, in for a pound.  Do you know that saying?

What's it all for?

Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.

They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.

This has to end.

You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.

And what of the Eloi?

If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...

I'm tired of running.

How do you keep the water temperature stable?

Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --

You promised me flowers.

You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?

... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?

I know it's not a diamond but --

Alex...?!

My God...

Let them.

Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?

In the future, we'll be better.

Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.

I've been working.

I'm sorry, David.

It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.

What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...

It wasn't your fault, Alex.

Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --

Yes.

Is there a lot of illness?

It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.

How long ago?

Why?

I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?

Is he all right?

I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.

You seem fascinated by the stars.

Good night, then.

Yes.

And this is your "work"?

Want to be a high climber now, do you?

It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.

I don't understand.

Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.

This is where my journey started... right here.

Yes.

Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.

Yes... I suppose so.

Kalen...

Don't torture me -- do you have it?

Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.

Yes, sir, he --

My equations are not parlor-tricks!

And hungry, I'd say.  You had such a long journey.

I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?

You ok?

[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...

You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?

I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.

We are not birds of a feather.

Yes.

You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.

The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.

That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.

My father used to talk about you.

This is really happening, isn't it?

Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.

Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...

[Beat] What's your name?

What for?

How'd he die?

I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.

[Beat] You bled to death.

I have no idea.

Why?

Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?

Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.

And if I didn't want to come?

You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.

No. I don't want it to.

You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.

At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.

Exactly.

I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?

Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?

The future doesn't look different?

You told me this was how it happened.

I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.

Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.

[Beat] How do you know?

Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...

It's gonna be sticky.

I'm not sure.

Well, where are you from?

Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.

[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.

What's this?

I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...

You like it?

... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.

That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?

Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!

You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come out alive?  I don't know. Let us think about that.

That's certainly possible.

Good God.

Now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out.  And you know Judge Hainey.  He hates this sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well, I think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight, don't you?

Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!

Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan!

So J.D., what are you studying in school?

So how come you don't have any kids?

I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?

That sounds nice.

I am the great and powerful Oz...

How?

No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?

Where'd y'all go?

You're in Oklahoma?!

Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.

You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.

Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.

You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.

Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.

I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.

I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.

I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.

Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?

Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.

Shit!  I... I, which way?

We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?

Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?

I wish we could've brought him with us.

Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...

That's puttin' it mildly.

I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.

So what are you gonna tell him?

How do I look?

Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.

Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.

I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?

Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.

I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.

For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.

Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?

But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!

It won't work.

That J.D. kid is a little shit.

I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.

Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.

What?!

Sorry!

Ready?

Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.

What?

You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?

We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.

We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.

I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting!

Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?

We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.

There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.

God!  It looks like the Army!

I'm not apologizing for shit!

Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?

That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.

Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.

I'm asking you to leave.

Gay? He said you were gay?

Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.

Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?

You're kidding? What did they say?

Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.

You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?

And this adversely affects me how...?

Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.

Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?

The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.

So... I see you made the news.

Uh-huh. Where was he?

He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?

We're in love with your roommate.

You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?

Nineteen months I been sober.

I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.

The sawbones?

Oh yeah.

The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.

Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.

Don't you want to know my name?

What are you doing with all these blueprints?

Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?

The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?

Is this one art deco or art nouveau?

You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...

Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.

No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.

Yeah.

Mary ah, forget it.

Fuck!!

How's my stomach taste, she says.  Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.

Urrggghh...

Any idea where I might start looking?

All you want is a phone number?

She's blackmailing you, right?

You want her dead, don't you?

Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?

I think your life's about to change.

Nope. Never been.

Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.

Thanks, Healy. Good work.

Well I think you're right, I should look her up.

Hey, hey, hey!

...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.

That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?

Thanks for picking me up.

Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?

Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?

Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.

So who's the lucky guy?

Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?

Bundt cake?

Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?

You don't think they're too big?

So who you taking to the prom?

Are you all right?

Ted, are you okay?

You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?

Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --

Sure.

Twenty-two.

It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.

Well... why don't you move back?

So you're a writer?

That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.

Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?

That you put a murderer on my trail?

Get over here.

Yeah? What do you want?

I, uh... I got it stuck.

You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.

Well, there's only one thing to do.

No! I was pissing!

We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.

This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?

With the caveat that it is not made public in any way, shape or form.  And we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest. I cannot stress this point enough.

He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.

What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.

I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.

Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.

We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.

We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.

He gets it, but he's pissed.

Jesus...

Zorin will eat him alive!

Oh, still sore about this.

Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.

We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?

What's it about?

Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.

John. How much time?

Max.

-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!

Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?

Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. He can clear the air on Anglo American relations.

It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?

Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.

No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.

Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.

I don't care. Cancel it.

I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.

We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.

We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.

What's that?

-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --

At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.

Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.

Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?

They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.

Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.

Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.

Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?

Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --

Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently.

Couldn't sleep.

I got one up on ya.

Meet me at base. Over.

They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.

I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.

Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --

Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...

Alright. Alright...

I'll sleep around a little.

You ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking Everglades, Mister.

What?!

-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.

No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.

I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.

Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.

But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.

What's he smoke in that?

What was he saying?

So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --

The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?

Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.

Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?

Not no more.

You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.

You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?

Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?

1868...

Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.

This Clear Moon's house?

I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.

You take care.

You're the Indian FBI.

Thank you.

Your relatives must've taught you something.

Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.

What ya want?

Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.

That's a big comfort to me.

I thought he'd never leave.

You saw a MiG 21?

It's what?

Two.

What would?

Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?

What if he's not?

And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...

Hard to argue with that, isn't it...

Why'd you do that?

No!

Does it bother you?

That's what you get flight pay for.

You don't have to do this.

Goose is dead.

You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.

Looks like a tie.

Well?

One SIXTH the speed of sound!

Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...

I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.

We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?

Were upside down!

We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.

OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!

WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?

If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!

THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!

5000 feet. Speed two hundred.

What do you want?

Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.

Did what?

What are you doing?

Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.

What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?

Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.

That's Kazanski.

I was a victim of circumstance.

She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.

He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!

ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.

ON THE NOSE?

I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT.

The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?

It was bad.

Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.

Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?

SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..

For the same reason you are.

How do you feel?

He was...my responsibility--my RIO.

I called your house.

We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.

Or you can quit.

Not something they tell dependents.

What to the rebels want?

So, where to?

And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.

What do you want?

Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.

He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.

I didn't want it to end this way.  I wanted Hauser back.  But nooo.  You had to be Quaid.

What the fuck is going on down there?!

Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.

I say we throw the switch and see what happens.

Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.

Two-headed monsters?

Your sexual orientation?

Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.

Amazing.  Where are we?

I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.

Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.

Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.

Quaid!  That's Quaid!

HER!

On his way.

Yeah.

Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall?

They sell fake memories.

I don't know.  Maybe.

Why not?

No shit...

What trip?

I did?

What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!

You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.

Are you saying she liked it?

What was that?  I couldn't hear you.

He's not at ground level.

Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?

Lori...

--I got a trip to Mars.

You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.

Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.

Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...

I give up.

Secret agent...How much is that?

Go on.

...What?

I'm not falling for it.

So you dropped by to apologize?

Now what?

By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?

Not bad, for a hooker.

The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.

What can I do?

The whole core of Mars is ice.  The reactor melts it and releases oxygen.

Wait!

Yeah, like they got a plan...

Yeah, still got one poking around.

Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...

What the hell you doing back already?

Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.

We're not going over there, right?

Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.

Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.

Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.

You're gonna get us hung up.

You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.

Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.

Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?

Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.

Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.

Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!

You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.

You go north, I'll go south.

You're right, don't matter where they come from.

Its tires are flat...

Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!

They're...they're trying to make us move!

Road's in!

She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.

The con...!  Oh my God.

And I appreciate it.

Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...

You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.

Yeah, they're confused.  They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.

I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!

It worked!  There they go!

I brought it... to the coroner.

Or this -- is this a significant difference?

I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi.

Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?

Clyde, you wait here.  Glenn, got a minute?

Not the whole time, of course. I --

You see that? You wanna be like that?

What other case?

I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!

I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.

I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!

"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!

...Jesus!

How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?

Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?

I embellished.

I embroidered.

-- Find him?

I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work.

Eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and --

Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...

Racist asshole came at me.

An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face.

But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?

'lo, Cecil.

Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?

I see: He'd walk out next month.

Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --

-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?

I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.

My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes. One's in Butte, Montana. Other's at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric.

It's okay. It was always like that.

...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?

Mr. Ortega, you've known the defendant at Ossining Correctional for how long?

Five years.

Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.

Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?

And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?

By "takes care of," you mean "kills".

Mr. Ortega, what is Shu Kai Kim's rank within La Compania?

You're a l-lawyer?  I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...

CIA?

The phone company was broken up.

Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?

Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?

Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?

Tell me some other things about her.

No.

No. Never. You'll have to kill me.

Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?

Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.

What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.

Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.

That's not the way to Cliff's trailer. I told you.

Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.

Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.

OK, Gordon.

Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.

That was really something.  That dancing girl.  What did it mean?

What is it?

One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?

Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.

The usual, 9:15.

You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...

Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.

Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?

Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.

If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.

No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.

Why do you do it, Laura?

Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.

Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.

You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.

No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.

It does matter. We're in love.

We were supposed to be together.

I've got to see you.

What's going on?

Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.

Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?

History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.

Josie, I think we should go public.

Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.

Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.

Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?

My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.

Where's Dad?

Who was that?

No.

Did you come home during the day last week?

Did you get this from your lover?

Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.

Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?

He was accused of jury tampering.

So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.

That was our insurance company's recommendation.

Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.

What are you doing here?

...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...

...he wants to testify...?

This is going to drive the ante up.

In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?

Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?

Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?

Orthopedics?

What book is that?

...of Anesthesiology?

How old are you?

Objection, we've...

Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...

Say it.

Anything special about the case?

Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...

...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.

And what did your team do...

...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...

You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?

Dr. Thompson...?

These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...

You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.

Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?

If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?

They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...

Uh, why, why are you doing this?

Thank you.

D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?

And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?

Yessir. I'm sorry.

That's it...?  Come on, guys... life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.  Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.

I need an extension for my case.

I had a witness disappear on me.

I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today.

Galvin, look, many years ago...

D'you find an apartment?

I changed my life today. What did you do?

What Hotel are you staying at?

I'm a lawyer.

Really. How wonderful for you.

Why don't you get some rest?

Well, then what are you doing here?

You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?

Maybe I'll tell you later.

You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...

Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!

Joe...  Joe...

Thank you.

Continental Casualty...

I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...

You know what happened.

Then why don't you testify?

I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?

My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...

He saw her at the Northern Care...

We just can't do it anymore.  This is our chance to get away.

What does it mean?  I... I mean we, you have other tactics...

Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...

No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...

Well, well, well. Huh?

Hi, Mickey...

...now who is that...?

I have to talk to you.

Are you out of your mind...?

You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.

Right.

Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.

Give 'em a box of Macanudos.

Yeah? How's our new witness?

Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?

'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'

...four years ago...

What the hell are you doing here?

We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?

I spoke to her, and everything is all right.

...of the procedures...

Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.

Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?

Did you see it come down?

Did it do you any good?

I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.

How does it happen cars are running?

I never noticed before - that's a cowboy tie....

Is that... machine...?

I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.

He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!

How long was I out?

That needle ain't pointing north!

What is that gizmo?!

A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.

That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.

That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?

I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.

I thought he'd stopped doing horror.

The nightmares.

So I don't know about horror.

Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.

And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?

Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?

Just be careful, okay?

Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!

no.

This is going to give you nightmares.

"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."

Dylan, you go back to sleep now.

I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!

You okay, champ?

Tell you what.  I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now.  You know home isn't far from here, right?

Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?

I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?

You didn't jump in.

A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.

I want to see the body.

Heather, what is it?

I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.

Like the Genie in the bottle.

Then what is he doing?

Isn't there anyone that can stop him?

Can I get you something to drink?

That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there.

Looks like weather.

A pretty young maiden she happened my way...

Everyone aboard young Bill?

Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!

Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?

How old are you, son?

Make us proud.

I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  That sound good?

Rick March.  Who the hell are you?

I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.

Yeah.

Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me?

They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.

I thought this was your dream come true.

I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".

You only hurt yourself you know?

Listen man, I think I have a problem.

Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?

Do you have your ticket?

How ya doing?

My parents don't do it anymore.

Where are you from any way?

Ah... Northeast... sir.

Shouldn't we turn away?

Chicken is a fool's game captain.

Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?

Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.

Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.

Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.

Oh, really?

Well, what does it have to do with? Us?

I think you were too hard on Weathers.

Son-of-a-bitch.

They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.

Don't ever call me stupid.

How would you know?

I don't.

Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.

Tie it off!!

Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...

About yourself?

Phil.  What are you doing?

You're a day late.  We keep a schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend on it.  Hello, Philip.

Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.

Yes, that's true.

The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  Everybody goes home.

The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.

And you didn't do anything about it?

If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?

Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.

Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.

Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.

Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?

Need a hand?

Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.

What's she doin' here?

Nice of you to drop by.

What'd you say?

Mostly black though in that boogie place.

You hitched yet?

I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.

But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?

The same to you. If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us. The Hondurans are great friends of the American people. But I have a joke for you before I go. If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first?

Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?

Hasta siempre.

I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there'd be trouble. He's just got some kind of influence over her I can't decipher. There's somethin' wild in Lula I don't know where it comes from. You gotta find 'em, Johnnie.

I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.

Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.

Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.

Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.

Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.

Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?

What brand'd she smoke?

I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.

Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?

Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?

He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.

Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.

One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...

Sailor!

I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.

What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.

They sure do stink.

Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.

Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...

Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.

Just part of life on the road, peanut.

Now what?

You find any work?

It's okay by me, peanut.

You been drinkin', huh?

Sail?

He's the kind liked it.

Mama???

Just a place.

Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?

Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.

Six.

Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.

Wouldn't make any difference.

Oh God! What does that mean?

What do you want me to do about it?

Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.

How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?

You need to explain it.

Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?

Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.

...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?

So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.

Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...

Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...

What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.

That's just how my brain works, I guess.

Actually... I just want to go home.

He's fine. He's narrating.

Hey. What are you guys doing here?

You snore.

Thank you.

Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.

It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.

Left you...? Who? Emily?

So. Is he any good?

Shit.

You know -- based on what I've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade.

Which is?

Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?

Is he awake?

Shut up, James.

Who do you think it is?

So -- what do we do now?

Naturally you have copies.

Came to my senses.

Me? What can I do?

I'll be... somewhere else.

You driving this car?

Vernon.

Who's got a gun?

Yes. But that's not why I called...

...reconcile with Emily.

Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.

It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.

Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?

You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.

Well...

Really? That's remarkable.

James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.

Is that really it?

I'm okay. I just lost my balance.

Oh.

How did I get here last night?

I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.

Who?

It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.

Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.

It feels really... good... here.

I just wanted a little sip.

Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.

Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.

It's warm.

Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.

It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --

Want a bite?

What would you call them then?

You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?

I'm not going with them.

I'm a little worried, James.

James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.

I thought we were going to talk. Last night.

Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?

The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?

Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.

I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.

I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.

Has he asked to see the book yet?

Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.

Well...

Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.

You heard? How?

Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.

I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?

And what did you say?

I guess you have to go on faith.

Did you just make that up?

Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.

You mean because his career's ruined and all?

Who's this ?

It's three-thirty, Grady.

Excuse me?

Do you get high, Sam?

Where's Emily, Hank?

Where you stand?

We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.

One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?

Are you riding with me, James?

Hey, is that a school?

She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.

Then what? What?!

You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.

Carlos, can I ask you something?

Nothing.

Something like that.

See anything interesting?

Hiya, Walter.

I think you do.

Doesn't everybody?

Too much sun.

You walked home.

Do you believe in them?

Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?

You don't know?

I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?

What's with the boxes?

The passionate one?

Are you taking your medication?

But you are taking it?

You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.

Yeah, like the bird.

No thank you.

Yes.

I don't want to hurt my daddy.

You should go home.

That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?

You seem a little hostile today.

How's the journal?

Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.

What are you afraid will happen?

Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?

Do you think you're crazy?

How long is this going to take?

Will I ever be normal?

How do you define it?

I want to be normal!

I don't know.

You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.

Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!

We'll talk about it more on Thursday.

You're very late.

Please don't do it again.

When did it all start?

If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.

Close your eyes.

And what are you doing?

A nap?

Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?

She's still really hurt... and angry. I don't know... if she will ever... forgive me. I understand that. I do. I just hope... I just want her to...

What?

I'm talking about you.

Very weird.

You don't hang out with the other guys.

Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.

My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.

What about bears?

They could eat you.

I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.

I thought I'd stay the night.

Is that all?

Look, you can go now.

Why don't you just go now, okay?

Get your kicks somewhere else.

You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?

You know, this is crazy.

Being here, with me.

All three -- in chronological order.

I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.

You're scared.

We should live together.

It's a bad idea.

Most people don't have my kind of problems.

Don't be scared, Walter.

Don't do that.

What's going on?

Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.

She-hit.

Lord Almighty.

I can't believe you let them do this!

No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.

I haven't worn mine in months.

Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?

The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.

Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.

All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.

Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.

I think it likes you.

You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.

You totaled it, huh?

Son of a bitch!

Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--

It is insane.

Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.

Do we just leave him there?

Come on, man.  What else could it be?

Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.

Hey, you guys are milking that job.

Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.

Y'all could be more specific.

SHIT!

Figured that out for yourself, did you?

A non-terrestrial intelligence.

Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...

High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.

He can still make it.

Would we see the flash?

When do you have to go back?

Then how come you're not with him?

A little more so this time.

In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?

It's already two hours... What are we going to do?

These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.

It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.

Have you decided?

How wonderful!

There's no comparison.

And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it?

Has she ever spoken to you about me?

Claudia, listen to me...

Any news?

Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.

That's why I asked you...

But you know it already. Why must I tell you?

No, Sandro... Please...

What are you saying?

I'm too sleepy.

Good night, my love.

I don't love you.

Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?

I'm not coming.

How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.

They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.

And tell Corrado, too, that I'm here... if he wants me. You can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad, and that at this moment, it's the only thing that interests me. Is that clear?

Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?

At one time the Aeolian isles were all volcanoes.

Why didn't you ask me to go with you?

I'll stay here also.

Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?

But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?

Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.

Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.

Don't you ever paint men?

And why wouldn't we have one like this?

Whose boat is that?

Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?

We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.

And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?

You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.

Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...

I would like to ask you something.

Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.

I can't say.

I am, there's too much flesh on me.

It's a sin to be fat.

Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.

But she watches... she listens.

I'm not hungry.

Of God.

Why?

We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.

For what?

Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?

I just heard you.

Have you ever loved anyone?

Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?

Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?

Do you think he loves you?

You've been alone together?

Something I ate.

Down... there.

I... I don't understand.

I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.

No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.

No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?

I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?

How did she know that?

Who?

Agnes...

Did your mother see angels often?

Do you believe she really saw them?

Why not?

What the child?

What did you do?

Yes?

Oh, yes.

Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?

Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.

Are you pretty?

You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.

And why am I here?

Why?

And then what happened?

Which one?

Why isn't anyone coming?

Him.

She'd seen him too.

From the belltower the day she before she died.

I hate him...

You saw it all didn't you?

What did you do?

Eve, she strangled a baby!

Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.

Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.

Something they... that they overlooked.

I'll have a decision by next week.

I'll have it.

No, no, no...

No!

Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?

Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.

Yes.

I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...

You can call me Sister.

How did she hide it during the day?

Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?

And you didn't try to find out who?

She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?

Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.

Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.

Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.

No... not in the eyes of the police.

This was before her pregnancy?

Why didn't you take her to a doctor?

She has it now.

You hate us don't you?

When would Agnes have conceived the child?

Do you have a... a diary or a day book?

Oh, Dear God...

No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?

Do you know what she did to her?

We'll see about that.

Bullshit yourself!

Who said anything about the Catholic Church...

That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.

Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...

Mary Magdelen?

Do you want to become one?

Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?

I'd like to begin.

I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.

If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. 

Don't be ridiculous.

There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.

You tied the cord around its neck.

I doubt that's what she'd say.

She can't remember.

Lay them down.

They're yours.

You heard, it gets on my wick.

What about all these letters?

Can you fix him for me?

I'm afraid I don't understand.

Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?

Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.

Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.

Sure. .

Oh, listen to teacher's pet.

You haven't, you're just late.  Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.

Come on, Auntie, you're winning.

What are we waiting for?

Morning!  Who's that little old man?

Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.

Sorry.

Oh!

Are you supposed to be here?

Thank you.

Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?

But that's not like a real person at all.

They ought to be.

Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!

And what do you do about it?

Ah.

And what's it all come to in the end?

When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.

Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?

And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.

What are you doing?

I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.

Hello, Grandfather!

You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.

And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!

Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?

Yeah ... so what?

Is that yours?

What are you doing there?

Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.

Behave...

Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.

Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!

I'll brook no denial!

Hi Norm!

No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.

Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...

It's all over the place, everyone knows.

You're a window rattler, son.

Eh, where's my grandfather?

I've got the stuff. Come here.

Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.

Stop picking on him.

What do you think are you're up to?

Look after him.

Down the ... er ...

"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!

Put it this way, he's mislaid him.

Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?

So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.

Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?

Gravity?

Activate lifter quads.

Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.

This is Chaz.

Maybe we can get in by the top.

Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down.

Are you okay in there?

What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?

What's wrong?

Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?

Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?

Unknown!  What do you mean?

What do you mean?

Okay.

Dead!

Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.

It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.

He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.

It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.

I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.

I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock.

Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.

We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 

<u>How</u>?

If we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.

You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.

Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.

Now what's wrong?

What?  What was that?

What do you mean, no?

I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.

That must have been when he got it.

I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.

This should do it.

I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.

Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?

That way.

It's close, real close.

<u>What is it</u>?

Oh God, oh God no.

It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.

I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it "The Snark Log."

How?

I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.

No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.

All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.

What the hell happened?

Yeah, okay. 

Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.

What would you say that was supposed to mean?

Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --

Here, Chaz.

I understand why you did that.

Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him.

Take us up.

Yes!

What's it doing, having a seizure?

Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!

Are you <u>crazy</u>?

Two down, four to go.

Can you make out any pattern in all that?

It was time for that a couple days ago.

Let's hear it.

All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.

Kill me...

That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...

No... don't...

What is it?

Better?

Yeah, it's fine.

A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.

MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.

I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?

Where're they headed?

What's going on?

Not yet.

Oh, man...

One of 'em must have escaped.

What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?

Hold it, hold it...

Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.

We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.

She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.

Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?

It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.

Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.

Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.

What is that?

First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.

Think I spoke too soon...

I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.

And what is your name?

After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.

- perhaps more than one. There's so much I want to know. I've heard your story in bits and pieces... your home in Wisconsin, your tragic marriage, your financial attachment to Margo - it started in San Francisco, didn't it?  I say - your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco, didn't it?

And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?

You take charge.

I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...

Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.

I don't think that's funny.

There never was, there'll never be another like you.

Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!

I can't believe my ears...

You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it!

Then say so.

And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?

I don't suppose there's a drink left...

Because I don't want to.

No, it's not.  It's for this.

Let's go sit by the piano.

Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?

This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.

I was there. An eyewitness.

Margo? Lunching in public?

I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?

Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...

Good luck, genius...

Nothing?

Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard-

Can't keep his eyes off my legs.

I told her. I sounded off.

Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...

Many happy returns of the day...

Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?

Okay.

Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!

It's a pretty rare quality these days.

Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out?

Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?

The audition.

You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?

- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!

I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.

I wish it were.

The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard...

There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...

I don't have to. I want to.

Every day.

Thanks for your help... good luck.

Yes. Yes, it does.

I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.

- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.

You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?

You hear all kinds of things.

Find out.

You need new girdles.

How do you do, my dear.

There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-

An answer.

She works hard.

You all put together?

The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.

I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.

Who are you?

How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?

Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-

I'm going to take you to Margo...

You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?

If I only knew how...

Not just that way. As a friend...

Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up...  ... whose is it?

Mrs. Richards.

Karen...  ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.

... you want to be Margo's new understudy.

No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...

You won't forget it?

I don't expect you to be pleasant.

Addison wants me to play it.

Congratulations, Eve.

Well... it started with the play before this one...

No, don't go...

I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?

If you'd like.

Good evening, Mr. deWitt.

Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start? Oh, hello, Eve...

Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...

Ain't it the truth?

So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...

Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.

About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.

"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"

It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"

Now let's not get into a big hassle-

Coming?

It's just possible she didn't...

What time is it?

I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...

Lloyd, be careful...

Eve.

She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...

You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression...

If we could cast it properly, that is...

You've got to admit it would be a novelty.

Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?

The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?

Who's left out there?

When you do, let me in on it.

"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?

Don't be evasive.

Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...

... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-

She's your understudy.

I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-

I'm sure.

You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-

You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...

I never said it was!

I don't think I could be.

Hello..

I placed...?

"Liebestraum."

Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?

Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...

I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?

Anything to help you out, Max.

Promise.

Are you breaking the contract?

--it was fine the way it was--

--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--

--no way--

You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.

All right, what do we know?

Maybe a political operative of some sort--

What's that?

See her?  Get anything?

Who's first?

I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.

--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.

It goes very high--we've got to find out where--

--there had to be a White House overseer--

--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--

That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--

California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states.  Why does everything you play sound the same?

What's the matter?

--Jesus--

--jeeeeeeesus--

--jeeeeeeesus--

--what time is it?

Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.

I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.

Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?

According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.

During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.

You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.

But you know who did.

Sure--off the record.

I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--

Down to Miami and back--how much damage can I do?

--you got more than one source?--

What's a real denial?

--if he did it or just said he did it, God knows.

--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?

Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.

Five hundred; six maybe.

--you don't really think you're being followed?

You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?

No games, Irwin; give.

Who by?

We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.

What's this?

It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.

What I don't understand is how you got here.

Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?

They are not my clients.

You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?

The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--

That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign.

In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.

Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.

I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.

Where?

--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--

Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."

Anything?

Mr. Sloan?

I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.

Does "they" mean the White House?

Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.

Go on.

Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and I hate to bother you at home--

No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.

Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.

Good morning gentleman.

...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?

All right, I got some scotch.

So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?

I had no idea you'd be this good!

This is your plan, Finch?

This.  Right now.

You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...

You're gonna shit your pants!

Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?

Hey, what're you doing here?

What?  No I'm not.

Hi...

So you're going to Michigan?

I know.  Salt and pepper?

I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...

What about the game?!

There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.

This isn't any better, Chris.

I think I've had one.

Jessica, can you drive me home?

You got it, stud.

I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.

No comment.

Thanks.  It was my idea.

There's our man.

Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.

At least now I know what the hell they're saying.

Like a bet?

I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.

That's stupid.

Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.

Yeah?  Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.

Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!

Jim?

Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.

Dad.

Dad!!

Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?

Yes.  Seriously.

Whatever you want.

Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.

That is a <u>nasty</u> story!

...excuse me?!

This'll do.

She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.

Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.

You've still got a chance with Nadia, right?

No...you...go...ahead.

You are very good in the world history class, yes?

So you need to change, right?

You are done, James.  Perhaps I should be going now.

Stifler, you're such an asshole.

SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!

Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?

Oh, Kev.

And I want to try to make it up to you.

Like how?

And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.

See -- this is the nicest room.

Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.

Victoria...I love you.

I can't believe we just had our senior prom.

You ever hear of something called The Bible?

Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.

Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?

Yeah, but we'll still see each other.

<u>Yeah</u>!

God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.

Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre!

Merde! Just missed!

Merde! I can't believe this!

Either way works for us...

Oh fuck, you are his nephew...

Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.

Sure. I can follow that.

You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.

What happened? Did you cut yourself?

What about your glasses?

Don't you want to change?

Hello?

I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.

Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...

I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.

What the fuck!? You too!?

I hope they fucking fry us all.

Holy mother of God...

We don't both have to die.

I know where he'll go.

What does it say?

Whoa...

These tunnels must loop around and connect.

Oh God. Shit...

Okay, what the hell are you up to?

It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!

In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Enculé d'Americain.

Bullshit! Your uncle told you!

Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM!  Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!

No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!

Claude...?

The ADM. Let's go.

So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?

You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!

You recognize her?

Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?

I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.

I don't believe we've been introduced.

It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.

Claude.

He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...

Jesus...

Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -

Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?

Andy!

Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...

No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.

What did she say?

I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.

Here.

What were you showing her?

Are you running away?

Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!

Noooo....

Poor Meetoo!

Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.

I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.

Why do you want to go to Paris?

You said you wouldn't laugh!

Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?

I'm glad you found what you were looking for.

Dmitri?

Dmitri didn't want the money?

So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...

Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!

It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!

What was that?

Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.

Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...

She does.

Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?

What's your name?

Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!

Can I have your autograph?

Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.

What do you mean, next?

No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.

No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-

H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!

Lyndon Johnson?

Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.

Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?

Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?

I missed my therapy. I overslept.

Stop it, Alvy!

You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.

I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.

Alvy, now don't panic. Please.

Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.

Don't give it to me. Don't!

Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.

He was creepy.

You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?

So sorry.

No, no thanks. Hey, don't-

All right.

Oh, you do?

That's okay, you... we-we can walk to the curb from here.

You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?

Well... thank you again.

No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.

No, I got time.

Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?

Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...

Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.

Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-

Fifteen years, huh?

Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!

I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.

Yeah?

Gimme a kiss.

We can digest our-

Oh, yeah?

No.  You're a wreck.

Here, you want some?

Those are the two categories...

You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.

Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?

You see, like you and I...

Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.

You- Do you love me?

Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.

Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?

Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.

Uh-uh-why?

Well, I need grass and so do you.

Yeah.

Do you realize how paranoid you are?

Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.

Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?

Will it change my life?

Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?

David! David! I can't believe this!

Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?

Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...

Yeah, where is the spider?

Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?

Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-

Yeah, but it's real close.

I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...

You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.

Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.

God, it's so clean out here.

Oh, good. Okay.

Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.

Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.

No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.

You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.

What'd I do?

Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!

Here you are. There's people out there.

Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.

Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.

What-

Where are you going?

I can think of another word.

You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?

I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...

Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!

Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.

This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?

Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers.

What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.

Mean?

Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.

There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.

We do the show live in front of an audience.

You wanna lie down?

How about a ginger ale?

I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.

Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.

You fired the cleaning woman?

But she's colored.

Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.

Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.

Oh, gosh.

We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.

It could be freezing, it could be raining.

So who won?

Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?

Like you didn't know.  Who invited the bimbo?

It has your ring.

Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.

Isn't Skye amazing?

Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?

Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.

Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.

Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy.

You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.

What what's about?

Why didn't you bring him?

You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

So where is young Jonah?

Are you the funniest person I know, or what?

Thanks for coming.

I'm the hired help.

In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.

What is it?

And?

You need to call your dad.

And you know our friends, how?

The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.

He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.

Scout's honor.

What was it?  What the fuck was it?

I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.

Kiss the back of my knees.

I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?

Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.

She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.

Well, not yet.  The gate was open?

Two minutes.

She left the fucking gate open.

It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.

You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.

I don't look my age, Joe.

It's a shit novel anyway.

Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.

Anyone else?

I had an abortion two weeks ago.

You think this was to hurt you?!  My God, Joe.  It isn't about you.

I'm a monster.  Exactly.

I don't want to go tonight.

Panes!  How are you?

We have a gift?

Yes.

Do I put you off?

And I you.

You got your DP?

And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?

I meant Sally.

Please, Ryan.

Something soft.

Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't.

I'm a little nervous, so...

I need to leave you now.

Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.

I think there are sixteen there.

What?

I love it here.  Don't you love it here, Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love tonight.  And I love these people.  And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.  Utterly fantastic.

I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.

Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  Because, God help you if something happens to that dog?

Hi.  Monica and Ryan?

Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.

Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?

Panes is here!

Fuck you, Panes.

Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.

I don't want it to be just one of our parties.

Shit!

Shit.  It's my Galiano.

Um.  Happy for you.

Thank you, Panes.

You're keeping a record, are you?

Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.

I didn't know you had this.

Enough about me.

Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?

We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?

Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?

Tell me about it.

Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!

So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?

He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.

Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.

So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?

Really?

You're right!

You dance...

I order you to find out where we are!

Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?

But can there be a society composed of just two ants?

I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.

<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!

Worker!  Come back here now!

We're going to die!

Come on, Z.

So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?

Z!  what are you doing?

The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.

Of course --

Of course not --

Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.

Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!

Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.

What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Come on, you yellow-bellies!  Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!

Good.  You're a good soldier.

May I cut in?

General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?

No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?

Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?

All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.

Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.

We declared war again?  Are you scared?

Did you see that?  How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.

Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.

Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!

You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!

So this is your mother's apartment?

I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.

She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.

What did you do to your hair?

Good night.

Oh -- Miss Kubelik.  I've been waiting for you. FRAN You have?

I wasn't trying to be personal -- it's just that the fellows in the office were -- whether you wondering about you ever --

Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?

They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.

Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.

Marry Christmas.

One more?

Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?

No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?

That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --

I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --

Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?

What's your friend's name?

Something wrong with your legs?

But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --

You want me to move the television set in here?  You play gin rummy?

That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.

Too slow?

You sure you want to throw that card?

-- Mr. Sheldrake.

Are you all right?

In this house, you're supposed to.

Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?

Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.

Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.

You don't have to if you don't want to --

Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.

I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.

Would you mind repeating the question?

You do?

That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --

Where is your apartment?

How do you work it with the key?

The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?

I made other plans. You can have both tickets.

Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --

Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.

Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.

Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.

Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --

Naturally.

I see.

You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.

Especially not Miss Kubelik.

Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.

But this is the key to the executive washroom.

What's gotten into you, Baxter?

On account of me.

Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.

I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --

I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.

Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?

Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.

I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --

Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --

Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.

Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!

She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --

Any of that coffee left?

How do you spell her last name?

It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --

How's the patient?

What's this -- you packing?

Where are you moving to?

You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.

You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?

Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?

Not so rough, honey.

What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?

Say, what's going on here, anyway?

Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.

Sleeping pills.

Please -- just let me sleep.

What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?

Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?

I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --

Now, Fran --

Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.

I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.

All right -- I'll take you to the subway.

Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.

Did you have a nice Christmas?

You came in on that boat, didn't you?

Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --

What !

How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --

Two whole drums --

North ?

Sometimes.

Holy shit.

Arch light.

Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?

I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --

I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !

What're you trying to say, Captain --

Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --

Will they attack?

Who knows? Right.

What cat  ?

Touchy.

Terminate ?

Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?

Spooky.

Who is he?

Yeah.

Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.

You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?

American weapons?

We don't want to bother you any, we --

But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.

Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.

Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !

Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.

Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.

Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.

What's the furthest you been in?

Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?

That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.

Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?

You know, some day this war's gonna end..

Why did you come to ... my province.

You were not coming here, to see me?

What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?

Do you know me?

I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.

Do you?

I had immense plans.

And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?

The other one --

You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.

Simple. They don't want him to go.

But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'

You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son.

Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?

Are you warm, Captain?

What show ?

What?

30   CONTINUED:

102  CONTINUED:

Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you.  That's what you want out of this, isn't it?

...I won't let a killer walk!

165  CONTINUED:  

You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.

212  CONTINUED:

Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.

A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-

Had?

Oh.

What happened here?

Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'

I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.  Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  What's that?

High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.

Let's go.

Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.

Be careful, okay?

You're hurt.

Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.

When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington.

Surviving is what I know --

Stay put!

Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?

Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.

Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?

Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.

Have to backtrack, find another way down.

Folks come to Alaska for a real short list of reasons:  Money. Adventure.  Solitude.  Those cover most everyone.  But frontiers also draw another type of man.  One with a demon in his gut.  He comes to the edge of the world to face that demon, and lay it to rest.

There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.

I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.

Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.

Snow's to their advantage, kid. You can't see them, but soon as that plane comes, they'll sure as hell know where we're going. Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon. I'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away.

How come you didn't let him shoot me?

Look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.

Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?

You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.

Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.

You don't care enough about Sam to --

Neff, you know better than this...

You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.

Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.

I didn't know you had a secret admire.

There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.

It lets a crazy man into our lives.

Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.

Do you love me?

Have they done blood tests on him?

Have they done skin testing for allergies?

I'm starving.

The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.

Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.

An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.

So what are you doing with a dog?

Oh, please...

I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.

So you'll be at work?

No... no thank you notes.

Nice of you... thank you.

No, sir...

Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?

My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.

No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.

I'll never forget you said it.

Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?

How you doing?

Cute.

I should've danced with you.

Grouchy?

If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.

Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.

Well...

Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.

How to die, mostly.

Good night.

But you're beautiful... your skin glows.

We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.

I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.

I also regrew my beard...  but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you...  when it comes to people you...

He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?

How could you do that? He'll hurt him.

You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...

I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.

Actually, I don't think so.

My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?

Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

Would you leave now, please?

What did she say?

But you know where you're lucky?

Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.

That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.

Yeah.

What are you doing?

Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.

Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!

How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?

Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?

You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?

I'm on the scent.

How in the fuck do you know that?

What?

Is this how it went, Nick?

Bullshit.

You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.

What does that mean?

Who is that other guy?

So this is something between you and him?

I don't need you to get the money -- my money!

Listen -- I don't even know your name.

Because I'm done.

It looks like white's game.

More or less.

No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.

Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.

Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.

Do you have a passport?

About?

It helps me to focus.  It centers me, helps me think.

Not even a stalemate?

In Costa Blanca.

Really?

Where did you learn it?

Two way?

That's right.

If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.

What did he say?

You didn't take it.

Did you think they were newlyweds?

I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.

He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.

Why?  I don't know.

Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?

Attraction is a complication?

Were you attracted to me right away?

When did it start?

Was nice.

I wasn't watching television.

Thank you.

Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.

I think I've heard of you.

One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?

I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?

Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.

Can I ask you a question?

Your a good guy Chris you deserve a nice girl.

You guys having a go a me or what?

Anything in it?

Fifteen crowns.

Oh yeah, what's that?

He's not drunk, he's crazy.

Like Custer huh?

Good news comrades, it's better than we'd hoped. Lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it's a piece of cake.

Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.

Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.

Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.

I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.

It must be on the other side of this.

I thought you were gonna throw these?

So why didn't we?

You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.

Red or white?

No, We aren't going to do it.

Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.

My God! What happened?

What happened to Katka?

You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?

Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?

Shit no, it'll be twice cost.

I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.

Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.

Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?

Yeah, no problem.

It was a condition of getting Doug out.

Yeah, pretty well.

Take this exit.

There shooting at something.

Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.

Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?

Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.

It's just talk, he's drunk.

I don't want to get in trouble.

That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?

If you get out can we be together again.

But we could go to London and live in England.

I don't understand, it's your home?

Forget about me Kat.

No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.

Yes, of course...maybe one hour.

You mean it's started?

I thought I'd help out.

Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.

Why are you doing all this, what for?

Shall I wash these out?

Did you take your things over to my place?

Why don't we both forget about him?

Where did you steal the car?

And you broke into that room?

What was the real purpose behind this venture?

Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.

Would you like your things now?

And a fifty foot extension lead?

Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.

All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.

I decided to help out at the Asylum.

Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?

That's my bag.

Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.

Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?

She's coming over here...

She asleep?

Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --

There's hot cider in the kitchen.

Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.

I'm sorry. I didn't know.

I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?

Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.

Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.

Who are you?

You.

Get yourself a glass.

He goes to my father's church. He could've died --

Because, growing up, books were my world.

'Is it really me?'

This play -- ?

I'm an enemy?

Like you'd know.

No problem --

I'll get something for us to drink --

But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --

Looking for intelligent life?

You're really into God, right?

Yeah.

You're not in a very good mood.

Or anywhere where people might see us.

All of it.

Your turn.

It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.

You're acting like a crazy person.

We can measure wind.

I might do it wrong.

Come on.

How do you know this place?

When did you build this?

Here. Why am I looking at this star?

I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --

Now? We just --

I'll talk to your father.

Will you do something for me?

The Carter boy. Tell me about him.

By accident --

Did you give him a gift?

I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.

No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.

You're in the play?

I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.

I care for her.

This week.

So talk to us about something.

How about your family?

I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?

I thought she built it herself.

You've been well?

You're marrying again.

Now I can do what I want.

Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.

For Jefferson High. For books.

So what did we just make?

Morning Dick.

How was school today?

Learn anything?

Hi, Marty.

George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!

Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?

Oh yeah.

You've gotta ask her to the dance!

Huh?

Maybe if I used my left....

You know damn well that's not what I meant.

Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.

March 11th.

What?!

The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.

Of course. Shemp is unaware that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over. We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp the trip was instantaneous.

A gold mine?

Well, Professor, are you sure you want me to tell you? You know, changing the course of history and all....

Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!

I don't recall ever seeing it before.

Where did you get this?

Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.

That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?

Thanks for everything, Pro.

What year is this?

What theater was I at?

Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.

Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.

...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.

What did you do to your hair?

How you doing, Cato?

Where'd you get them antlers?

What'd they look like?

Does he bite?

What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?

Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.

Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?

What for?

No, you're not either.

I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.

Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?

Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.

You still in school?

Yeah.

Nothing.

Quit my job.

Anybody ever call you "Red"?

Why not?

Somebody else is going to get it.

Gosh, what was everybody talking about?

You know what I think?

"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."

I found a lid. It was laying on the ground over there.

Look at all this junk.

You tired?

Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.

Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.

I'd like to get out of here.

I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.

Course it's too bad about your dad.

Yes.

She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?

Not me. No way.

Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.

Planet 10?

It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.

All accounted for?  Where's Penny?

Does this thing have guns, John Parker?

Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?

He offered you money?

What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?

Go away.  Let me rot?

Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!

You keep an eye on it.

Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.

Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.

Never.

I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.

Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.

What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.

Jammed--? By who? Whom by?

How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?

It's a spittin' image.

That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.

Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?

I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.

Okay, but that doesn't excuse his 

Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-

Before what?

Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-

Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-

So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.

I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks  well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational

No, I  I didn't mean to sound 

I beg your pardon?

...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?

...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man  to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.

I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.

I'm sorry, I just feel like I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-

I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the 

Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!

A souse!

I don't understand-

What do you do far a living?

... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.

...Is the egg showing or what?!

That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.

Well ain't that a kick in the head!

My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.

...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?

Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...

...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?

Yeah, but 

...Can I come in?

Why don't we go to your room-

Hold on 

Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.

Jesus, Charlie, I...

...Don't look at me like that, neighbor.  It's just me  Charlie.

To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik 

I  Mr. Lipnik 

Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.

Big fuckin' deal.

Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.

Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.

Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?

Why's it so goddamn hot out here?

Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik.

...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.

Mr. Lipnik, I 

The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.

I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here.

As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.

So -- how are things?

How is your -- personal life?

No?

What are you doing here?

We were in some of the same classes.

What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?

Who?

Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --

You should do something about this lock.

What are you doing here?

How long were you dating him?

How long were you having sex with him?

Did you leave the club with him?

Do you always keep old newspapers around?

Yes, you do.

But you didn't hurt --

I don't know anything that isn't police business.

What did you pay Nilsen?

What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?

Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"

I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.

You shouldn't play this game.

I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?

Do you think I told her to kill You?

I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.

You won't believe me.

I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.

About three months before I met you.

You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy --

They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.

Why not?

What do we do now, Nick?

I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?

There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.

Did you ever tie him up?

He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.

I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?

Was she ever a suspect?

What's goin' down, son?

No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke off yonder on the horizon.  They're gonna want your badge.

I don't think it's funny.

Everybody that she plays with dies.

Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.

I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!

What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.

You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?

You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?

How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?

Were you with him last night?

What was the motive?

Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything.  I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus.

First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.

You knew her, didn't you?

She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.

We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.

How old was she when this happened?

Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry.  No Lisa.

Hey  it's the big A.M..

Why, so you could humiliate me?

It's in New York.

You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.

Yeah... Like  stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.

Ten bucks apiece.

Cool.

Piss painting?

I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?

When?

Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.

Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?

Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?

I'm not black.

Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he?

Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?

I see..  And... How do you respond to being called  hmmm...   yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."

I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.

Paint it out.

It's Andy again.

You want me to put it here?

Hey  Willie Mays.

Who's that?

You got a date already?

Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.

Oh man! Folklore guy  worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?

What're you doing? You're doing something.

Check you later, man.

What's the rush, John Henry?

I don't really have any problems.

I don't go there. Too many party girls.

Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?

... babies.

What's that?

You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.

Would you check out my studio some time?

I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.

Some of them.

See you later.

That's a beautiful name. French?

What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it  did your girlfriend leave you?

Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts  you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..

You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother  when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.

You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.

I need this?

'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --

Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?

Admiring your handiwork?

Didn't I say that?

Well that's a ... long story ...

... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.

"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?

It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.

Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.

You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?

I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!

Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.

I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!

Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?

... eight, seven...

Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.

Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.

I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...

He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..

You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!

Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -

You certainly will not.

I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And...

I'm sorry.  I was too late.

He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.

Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze.  Batman monopolized the evening news.

Is there something wrong, sir?

I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death.  What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?

Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.

It's good to see you.

Women.

First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.

Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.

Please be looking for me.

Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.

Crimefighter's rule number two.

Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.

The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.

You think Freeze will take the bait?

I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.

No beauty...

No sign of the snowman.

Winded, old timer?

That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?

Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?

Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?

Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.

I wouldn't bet on that.

You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?

He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.

My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.

Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.

What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.

It'll never work.

Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?

Actually, he took the car.

She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.

I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne.  But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.

...A bat.

All the answers are numbers.

And another name for Mystery?

Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.

I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...

We all wear masks.

I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.

I haven't had much luck with women...

Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?

Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.

Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.

Psychiatrists make you nervous?

Fast work. You just moved here.

A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....

There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...

Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.

The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.

Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.

That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?

Wait! You said you'd let me go!

Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?

Where are you sending Batboy this time?

Not until you do that thing I like.  On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie...  Woah. Harsh toke.

Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.

We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.

Where's the boy?

I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.

All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.

What is this stuff? Kevlar?

Great.  Give me a grant.

I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.

Do you sail?

No.

Odd desire for anyone.

I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.

But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --

God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.

To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.

All street mimes should be executed.

I know it's late. I -- Are you there?

I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.

Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.

Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.

All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.

SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --

I'm on top of it.  If there's a problem --

My brother's a priest, man.

It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."

It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.

Joker here. Can we talk?

You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!

Burned out.  I need a vacation.

No.

Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.

Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?

Peanuts?

Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.

Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon

Are they paying you for all this?

Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.

I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.

The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!

HOLY SHIT!!

Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!

Yeeees?

Do we know anything about him?

David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?

Scottish.

It isn't working any more, David.

Jesus.

Go ahead.

Ali?  What's wrong?

Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.

Sort of half.....

I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.

0 my god.

Better go.  Grierson hates people being late.

It wasn't a dream, was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.

'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?

Say that again, son.

So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.

Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?

Ah... He certainly has something, sir.

You're not going to ....

The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.

Thank you David.  However, flattery will get you nowhere.  Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.  Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...

I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.

Honey, calm down now... it's okay...

You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?

They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?

But is she gonna be okay?

It is urgent, sir.

Interesting suit.

off the peg?

Huh huh huh. He said "anus."

Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.

Huh huh huh. That was cool.

Actually, we just wanna watch TV...

Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.

Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?

Beavis. This is what it's all about.

Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?

Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.

Heh heh. We're in Washington!

Damn, huh huh.

Check it out Butt-Head, TV!

Check it out Butt-Head, porta-potties.

Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?

Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt cheeks, huh huh huh.

Uh, you first.

You hear that, Beavis! We're gonna get alcohol, tobacco and guns!

Cigarettes and beer rule! Huh huh.

Uh... bye-bye.

Beavis.

I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down...

Does that say Xanax?

This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.

You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!

Did you give him a full cavity search?

You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?

Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?

What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?

Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!

We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.

Chief, look!

Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?

Really? That's where we're from.

Who sent ya?

Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.

Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!

Wave at the lion.

This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.

What?

Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.

Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --

We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.

Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.

There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.

What about this Beetle guy?

My God, we're back where we started.

God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?

Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.

Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?

And your sushi was remarkable.

<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?

Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!

A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?

What is going on?

Help vouchers?

You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?

This is <u>my</u> town.

<u>Barbara</u>?!!

I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.

Handbook?  When...?

Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?

Just one daughter.

I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.

Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.

If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...

If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.

I want to be dead too.

Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.

The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?

Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?

Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?

You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.

No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.

Can you help <u>me</u>?

Just don't tell Lydia.

Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!

Stepmother's...

Answer your mother.

Look at all that <u>parking</u>!

Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.

They're... not here anymore.

Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.

We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.

What's wrong?

'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?

You don't have a key?

I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.

Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?

It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.

Otho, that's terrible.

Their wedding clothes.

You were wrong, it did hurt.

You can pull your trousers up, now.

Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?

Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?

Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...

Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.

Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.

I would like to walk today.

Will you be leaving now, Robert?

Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.

A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.

Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.

At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.

We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!

Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.

Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.

Would you care to take it, sir?

Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.

I would like to watch television.

May I ask your name?

I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.

Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.

... Why... No, I don't think so...

Oh, I like that very much.

I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...

And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.

Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?

... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?

Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.

... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...

To watch...? To watch me...?

Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.

Chauncey! Chauncey!

I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?

Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.

Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?

Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!

Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.

It's a very pleasant room, Ben.

He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?

He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.

... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?

Yes. I would like to escort Eve.

... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...

Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...

Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?

... Sir?

How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?

It's starting to swell, is it painful?

... My suitcase.

... Evening, Chance.

... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.

Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook?  That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!

Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...

... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'...  ... gotta go now, Chance...

1952...?

What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?

No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.

Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.

Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...

... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of First American. But before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background...  ... Kinney, what did you come up with?

Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.

Do you feel well enough for that?

Good evening, Mrs. Rand.

Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.

... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.

It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...

I can certainly understand that...

It's that gardener!

And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.

This is not what I requested.

But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.

... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.

No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.

John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.

I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...

Say, aren't you that actor guy?

I never played a jewel thief.

Hello, I'm here about the ad.

Enjoy.

We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.

Seven-ish

I want to try.

I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.

What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.

You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.

What are you doing?

You've always hated the animals.

Suck my dick!

Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.

It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.

Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.

I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.

A better friend.

Maxine...

Holy shit, yes!

Holy shit! He said what I said!

I know. I'm sorry...

Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?

Mr. Juarez?

You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.

You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?

Just one. Why is this floor so short?

Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.

No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.

Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.

Dr. Lester. . .

Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.

Buy you a drink, Maxine?

Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.

Tickets to Malkovich?

But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.

Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!

But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.

Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?

Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.

No. Don't be an ass.

Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.

What kind of circumstances?

Do tell. I love a good plan.

Do you dream often?

Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.

I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.

I gotta know the truth, Kevin.

You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?

Anybody else?

But of course.

What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!

Aaaahhhh, the portal!

Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.

When?

We have to meet.

Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!

Never heard of it.

Can I get you a drink?

So, do you enjoy being an actor?

Come on in.

You still there, sweets?

Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.

Vegas.

This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.

Yeah what?!

Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.

You got to go sometime. You got to go out there by yourself sometime.

There ain't.

Well?

Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?

You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying?

We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle?

They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.

What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.

YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?

I want somethin' sweet.

Well, good luck with the job.

Yes?

Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.

What you want'em for?

I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.

Be here. In case.

They good whitefolks?

Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.

Back stiff?

She likes to see you off in the morning.

OUT THERE. WAY OFF.

Out where?

I know Denver.

Can't locate him.

You know he's colored? What else there to know?

It's her, ain't it?

I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.

You?

You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.

Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.

She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.

Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.

You shaved.

She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.

I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.

What, baby?

What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?

I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.

Sure Allan, I'll be there.

We've had some terrible news.  Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.

I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!

Excuse me?

What's this?

Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.

This is a hundred and eighty dollars.

His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!

Yeah.

Sheesh.

Almost five!

What tied the room together, Dude?

What--

What's a pederast, Walter?

If what's during league play?

It's already posted.

Kill that poor woman.

Who has your undies, Walter?

And then they're gonna stamp on it?!

What do you need that for, Dude?

And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.

That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--

Wonderful woman.  We were very--

Yes, heh--

Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.

Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?

I like your style, Dude.

Howdy do, Dude.

People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone--

Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.

I've heard the kidnapping story, so save it.  I know you're mixed up in all this, Dude, and I don't care what you're trying to take off her husband.  That's your business.  All I'm saying is, I want mine.

Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?

Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!

Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!

Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.

Well--sure, I could do that--

Oh that's okay, I hardly even--

She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.

From who?

Dieter Hauff?

Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?

Well...yeah--

Well yeah...I know that.

Jeffrey--

No, but--

Yeah, but--

Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.

Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.

I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--

Have it your way.  The point is--

Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?

They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!

Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs--

Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used to say.

Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--

Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--

You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.

I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--

They're nihilists.

Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!

Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your homework, Larry?

Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--

His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!

You're fucking Polish Catholic--

There weren't any shots.

Call the medics, Dude.

Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!

Dude here.

Yeah.

Another Caucasian, Gary.

Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--

Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--

Employed?

Huh?

Brandt, give him the envelope.

You monsters!

Whatta we do about the Mex?

Two years.

Where to first?

This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.

What about Nomak?

how long since he was bitten?

No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.

He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.

Anyone else make it?

You're hurting me.

It means "bloodbrother."

How do you feel?

He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.

What's your problem, Whistler?

Put it back in park, Blade.

Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.

What's going on?

Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.

What the fuck you doing?

His name is Jared Nomak.

Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?

Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?

This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.

Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.

I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --

Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.

You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.

Graffiti --

You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.

Like what?

I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.

Just get out of here.

I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.

No --

I can't -- I won't be able to stop --

How's it going, Kam?

Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.

Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.

The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.

I thought you promised to give me some distance?

That's weird --

Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?

-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.

These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.

How many of you are there?

Blade --

Who are you people?

Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.

I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --

I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.

What happened to the power?

Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?

I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.

Try, please, Anna--

Not that I can see.

Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!

Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."

Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.

Druid Hill Park.

So says her website.

No.

The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.

No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.

Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.

What?

You want me to scooch over next to you?

For once could you just sit down, shut up, and give something a <u>chance</u>?

--now c'mon!

Nothing. I dunno--

Are you marked like this??

Oh, Jesus, no--

Absolutely.

--hours before--

<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?

It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!

Okay, a blur.

The witch?

You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?

From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?

You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.

Never would've guessed.

Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.

Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.

Get <u>out</u> of here!

Get inside quick, they'll stop.

English.

She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.

Not the place you want to announce your arrival.

--it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--

--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--

You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?

Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.

Okay, but--

Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?

There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--

What--

Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.

--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.

Women miscarry all the--

What's that?

Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.

What're you afraid's going to happen?

--I know!

You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--

What?

Domini's the only logical explanation.

I can't do it!

"It's why the witch kills children."

What the fuck's going on here?

Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.

Good morning, Sheriff's Office.

....Ma'am?

Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.

Who was it?

Ray?... What time is it?

...You all right?

...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.

I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.

...But first I gotta know what happened.

If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?

So how long have you know Meurice?

I reckon I can hear him. TV option, that's a dollar twenty, makes nine eighty-six plus tax.

...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.

I told you. I like you.

Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?

Yeah.

I don't particularly want to talk to you.

...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--

Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?

...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.

...it's too damn risky.

Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.

No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?

Pour that back.

Howdy stranger.

Is Marty here?

I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.

Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.

To your health, Frank.

Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.

By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?

I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.

What color is it?

Who knows you have these?

For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.

Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.

Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.

He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.

Yes? What is it?

Oh God, that stuff stinks.

Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?

An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.

How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.

Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?

Sure I'm alright. 

Yes.

Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.

It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.

Oh shit.

Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.

Look.

Yes.

Do you like my body?

I want you to hurt me.

Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.

Look, snap out of it, will ya?

What?

Hold me, Don.

You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.

I don't want to go.

On a ride.

Hey? . You like to walk.

What are you lookin' at?

Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?

Oh yeah?

What else is new?. right?

Did they find out anything when they questioned her?

Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?

You hungry or thirsty, or both?

It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.

I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.

No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.

So. what's next?

I owe you. since I goofed up this one.

You really want to do this, don't you?

Brilliant.

It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.

. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.

Okay. yeah, call.

Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?

That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?

What's with Mike?

I'm sorry, I didn't.

You're sure right. It is a strange world.

I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you.  . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble.

No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.

I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.

You worry about me really?

Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.

I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!

Oh my God. What's wrong?

My father has a gun at home.

I should go with her, Sandy.

Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.

Look Jeffrey.

Thanks a lot, Mom.

I'm going out for awhile.

No.

No. you're right.

Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!

I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.

Come on out a minute, okay?

QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?

Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.

Are you sure this guy is cool?

Nothing like this back home.

This is it for me.

Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.

Should we buy it?

You wanna split?

I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.

George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.

You can't sell this to your friends.

Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?

Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?

I don't know...

Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?

Christ almighty, George.  Feed her a cheeseburger or something.  What does she weight, eighty pounds?

George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.

What's that?

I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.

Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?

How many kilos can we fit in these planes?

Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.

Diego?  It's George.

How are we doing?

Good to see you, Diego.

George.

Where do I put this!?

Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy.

Nothing.  Todo esta bien.

Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.

Cocaine?  How much?

Mexico.

Barbara.

Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.

The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?

The man in the garden.  He was full of courage.

Freedom.

Keep them coming.

Money.

I'm sorry, George.

There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.

I know.

No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?

She's angry.  It's all over the news.

...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's boots.

How are you doing, George?

You hear about your old friend, Diego?

Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him. We've got him dead to rights.  But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.

Figured it out.

Figured it out.

Hello.

I don't know.  My name is George.

Pablo said no?

What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!

Not in front of the kid.

What?

What do you want?

Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.

Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.

Mirtha, how are you doing?

I don't know.

What?

Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?

California, huh?

Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?

That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.

I swear.  On my life.

You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.

Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.

For instance, something like this?

Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?

Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.

Right on.

Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?

Nice weed, huh?

Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.

It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...

In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.

Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...

Which "district" do you belong to?

Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?

What ... What must I decide?

Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...

Of course. As soon as possible.

Read it.

No ...

Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.

Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thèbes?

Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...

Why?

Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - -  I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me.  I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?

Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.

Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon?

Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.

An inquiry into what?

Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces of sperm on the sheets.  The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.

Then how did it get into his body?

What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?

What did they argue about?

What was the nature of the argument?

I'll tell her but she won't take it.

I've got work to do.

That's ridiculous.

Her name?

Tell the court about that, please.

How did he look?

Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?

What happened next?

How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?

When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?

Can you give the court an example?

Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?

Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.

I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.

Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.

Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?

--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?

What did he say?

What happened?

Who told you that?

I've been to a few -- yes.

In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why do you think he did that?

Yes.

You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.

Yes.

And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.

He'll file.  He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.

As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?

Can we get out of here?

Why not?

What do you think?

Hello?

It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.

Really?

That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?

Can I see you later?

Something wrong?

I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.

Sugar or honey?

Rebecca -- take these off.

No -- he's lying.

Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?

You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?  How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?

Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.

Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.

What's she like?

Humped

I don't know.

Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!

I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.

Yes.

Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.

Well, that's a long time.

I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!

I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.

What?!

Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.

Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?

My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.

Grateful!?

I bet mom could've helped her.

Not yet. You want to go?

What do you know about "the changes"?

I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.

Roseman Bridge?

Pretty country.

There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?

Oh.

No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.

Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?

Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.

No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.

Help cook?

Oh my God...  You're blushing.

"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?

Do you miss it?

My God. How I'd love to see that.

You drink bug repellent?

When?

Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.

But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?

But it's not the same.

I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.

Francesca?

I would love to come for dinner.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.

Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.

Am I too heavy for you?

Sleep all right?

What are you doing?

Stop it!

You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.

I don't know. Please...

What about your husband?

What time is it?

Where you going?

"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."

I'm positive.

Betty.

Oh my God...!

It clearly states in the will --

Is it true?

Died there?  How?

You didn't hear that?  "Take him... " Something.  "Bury him" or...

'S up?

Damn.  That is the ugliest building I have ever seen.

You want us to move in here?

No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.

Where's the others?

We can climb out.

But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.

My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.

No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?

It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.

Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.

Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?

It's alright, baby.

If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.

Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.

Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.

Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.

We'll have to sneak in.

Guess it's not Rossmore Park.  Thanks for the help.

Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.

Cinn?

He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.

No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.

Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?

I'm here.

We're here.  Where the hell are you?

You got the cash?

Let me see it.

But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.

What are we doing down here?

Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!

No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.

Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.

Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --

Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.

What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.

You boys been hitting the pipe?

And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.

He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."

I thought you were bringing the Colonel?

Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.

Not really to live, just to play.

You don't think I'll do it, do you?

We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.

They just left, didn't they?

You mean they weren't up here?

Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?

I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him!

So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!

He didn't see you, did he?

See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!

Fuck.

What are you doing?

Where is the money?

Shut up, Violet.

Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've been going crazy over here, Gino!

We were in a car accident --

You planned this whole thing, didn't you?

You can't kill me yet.

Yeah?

No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.

No, Cease.  There was no answer.

We was worried about you, Cease.

Hey, Caesar, where's the key?

It's Gino!  It's Gino!

You got the key?

Call me as soon as you get him.

So this is temporary for you?

'63 Chevy.

So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?

I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...

A beer?

Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.

No.

How did you meet him?

Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.

I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.

For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar.  He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.

The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.

All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.

Why?

That's his brother.

Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?

Where will you be?

It's me.

Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.

okay, all right.

I was so afraid you ...

I'm sorry, Corky ...

Johnnie, what did I say?

Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!

I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.

They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?

She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.

We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?

<u>This is an operations desk</u>.

Forget it.

We don't know what we're into!

Treadstone?

Paris.  I live in Paris...

Yes.

<u>What did you do to me</u>?

I know you've been trying to kill me.

So now you know.

Jason Bourne is dead.

...yes -- oui -- uh...

...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?

We thought you were gone for good.

I need a ride.

I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.

Wait up --  -- just wait up --

And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?

-- you could put it together --

What are you talking about?

Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.

We're about an hour away.

Look, I don't know what's up there.

This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...

-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --

-- just --

He came to kill us.

You knew he was coming.

I trusted you.

But the police --

It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.

And that's it?

-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --

Where's the dog?

He run away often?

-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --

-- you gotta give me more to go on --

...ergency procedures.

... fix themselves.

Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!

...ven't you?

Sign here, please.

Sign the form so we can get to it.

Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.

We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.

Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.

Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one

Er ... Thanks ...

What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?

I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...

Too late? That's for me to say.

This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!

Hello, Jack!

Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.

Out of kindness.

Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?

Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.

It could all be coincidental.

Jack?... Jack?

How could you do this to me?

Yes.

I bet you'd like to touch them?

Are you alright?

Yes, of course. Sorry.

Where are you taking me?

What are you doing in Information Retrieval?

No, really.

Say, all wars have innocent victims.

Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.

Turn!

Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!

What happened to you after ...

Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?

Oh my God, a mistake!

Isn't it? Whose is it?

Oh, good!

It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.

I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.

Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.

There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?

Here. What do I do next?

Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?

Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?

Hey - that's my desk!

My mother said it would be all right.

Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.

I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am.

I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.

What were we saying?

Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.

Sam ... you haven't had dessert.

Mother? Is that you?

Is Mr Helpmann here?

Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?

Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.

Put the phone down and your hands up.

My I.D. cards.

Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?

I don't know which numero.

But we can get one.

Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.

A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.

Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.

The pace?

Can you fix it?

Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -

What do they want you or?

Frank Pierce.

She asked me to pick her up.

I guess I'll be going.

Does that hurt?

They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.

So, Frank, am I going to live?

Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.

Sure, sure, give go.

What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.

Is there any chance?

I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.

You shouldn't smoke.

That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?

He's dead, huh?

I think this place stinks.

My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...

You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.

I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.

Promise you won't go inside.

Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.

No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.

My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?

He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.

He one of them?

No.

Where's Burke?

I'm sorry.

The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.

Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.

Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.

You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.

Don't push it, Larry.

Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.

Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.

Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.

You're in the stomach!

Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.

Never to pretend to know more than I did.

Wait.

No.  No.

Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.

You packing up tonight?

I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --

He excels at gratitude.

It's nice to see you.

I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?

You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?

He must have been great-looking, right?

Nine seconds.

Watch? --

I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.

Did you bring your grey suit?

Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...

Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.

Aaron, will you tell me?

I think you're the Devil.

You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?

I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.

I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?

We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?

Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.

We came from Washington.

Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.

Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.

No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.

Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.

Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.

Anchor?

Look, I can start up with him again if you really...

Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.

How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.

Why so glum?

As long as that's your only problem you're...

I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.

It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.

I had no idea she was this good.

Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...

I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.

Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.

I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --

Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?

The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.

At work there's always this sort of film over you.

You okay?

It's not important.

What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.

No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?

Why can't I let go of this woman?

What?

Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.

Why?

I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?

I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.

If you were an artist you could have created something!

Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!

It's kind of dark -

I'm almost ready -

Not even a little bit?

When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...

A girl with a body like mine?

Walter can I ask you something?

Look -  This pose is all wrong!

You really like it?

What's it called?

These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.

You think she's better than Murdered Man?

May I please have another little kiss?

Did you hear what he said?

Are you ready?

I like you very much, Walter.

- even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him and I - just -

Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?

Are you alright?

Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.

No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...

It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.

I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?

Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...

Now what kind of statue was that?

Man this is heavy!

Where'd ya buy that?

No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.

Hiya Carla.

A show?!  Like this Sunday?

You better hold off on the bubbly.

You might talk too much.

What do you have in the box?

You like chasing the dragon, Walter?

You're gonna shoot me!

I saw your...cat.

I won't say good luck, Walter.

T-tell him that?

Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some friends later, and I have to take a shower!

I don't think this is gold.

You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.

I look horrible.

Well, um... litter?

Buffy!  Looking tasty.

Figures.

Hey!  She wasted my dog!

When you get your car together, man, let's bail.

I... feel.... pretty.

I'm hungry.

Wheels?

Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.

Buffy, what are you doing here?

I don't understand.

You left me a message?

Hi.

Pike, I don't think you're up to this.

Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.

You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.

Let's meet tonight, okay?

I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.

Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.

What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?

Why?

Everybody does.

None of your business.  God.

It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.

What, um...  What do we do?

Why do you keep saying that?

Oh, him.

Who we gonna beat?

Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!

What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?

Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?

What!?!

And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.

Five?

How can you keep doing this?

Watchers?

I'm curious, is all.

Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.

Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.

We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.

Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.

Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.

Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.

That is so cool.

Yeah... She's okay, though.

Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.

Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.

Hi, guys.

I can't!

The mark of the Coven.

Oh, yes!  Yes!

Buffy?

And Spring Fling.

What happened?

You're kidding.

I never thought of that.

They'll kill us!

God!  Take a chill lozenge.

Environment.  That's cool with me.

Oh, yeah!

All right.  Take care of yourself.

You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--

How ya like that?

God...I think I'm gonna be sick--

I think you're real cute.

We lost.

I'd like you to meet my father.

It's Skip, for you.

Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.

Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?

After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.

I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap.  I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.

But you were pulling your hips last night.

I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.

Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.

Damn.

Your place or mine?

Crash...I want you.

I think of you and the "boy" all the time.

And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.

I doubt that.

Why baseball?

I don't know if I'd go that far.

Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?

I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.

I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.

Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?

God bless you.

No, no, no.  Put it back on and take it off slowly.

No, that is not belief.  That is desperation.

I didn't spit on you!

Fastball.

An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?

Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...

You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.

You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?

Can I ask you something?

Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.

Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.

She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?

What's wrong?

No.

Good.  Good.  That's terrific...

We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.

Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?

Take the first shot at me.

Who you calling a "boy"?

No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.

Little high.

Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?

It's a miracle.

The organization wants to make a change...now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher...

Ain't here.

Well, I'd rather not say.

I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.

So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.

Hey, I need a room. Need a room.

You were wandering around.

You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!

You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.

Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.

Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?

...stupid things.

Stop -

But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.

Okay.

Hello.

...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.

After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.

Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.

I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.

If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.

Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?

In other words, I'm fucked.

- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.

...very difficult to get in.

Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.

You should say so.

Just say so.

What happened to me? What happened to you?

Yeah.

Listen, I would -

I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.

Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.

What - what, Caesar's?

...hundred yards further down the road.

You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!

You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.

Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?

What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!

I just told you. She called me.

Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?

Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?

You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.

You go and put your things away.

Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.

You've got to stop her.

...trying to offer you the respect that your...

He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.

She took care of the dealers...

You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?

Oh, it's so soft.

Oh, fabulous.

Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?

You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?

You didn't have to beat him up!

You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.

Yes, I - yes, I do.

Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.

What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?

Right.

So, what'd ya do with it?

With the money.

With Jennifer.

Why do you want to do that?

I was with somebody.

...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.

I mean, it could get us both killed.

Oh...

It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.

Oh, sh-

Fuck you.

Why don't you just let me go, Sam?

I want you to let me go.

Should I let her in like - ?

After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway.

- you could put 'em on your expense account?

Loose machines are right back over there.

Well...

Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!

You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.

Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.

We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.

Excuse me.

I just wanna get out of here.

I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-

You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.

I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.

Yeah.  I think I want my money back.

I'm just trying to get in my house!

Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay?

You just - Just stop him.

Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.

Hey!

You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?

You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -

Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you.

Are you sure?

You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?

But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.

Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.

Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.

I can see that. Sure.

I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.

He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?

You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?

And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.

See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.

I'm not as tough as you think I am.

What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him.

Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.

Yes!

What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.

Yes.

Well, how 'bout that?

Yeah.

I'm always here for you.

No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -

...they're in Penthouse K.

They checked in alone.

There's more!

There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.

Mm-hm.

Yeah, but they're complaining.

They're havin' a good time too.

You must have drunk too much.

He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.

He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.

Who's this guy? Who's this guy?

Take it easy!

You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.

I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad.

Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!

Tony.

I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.

You're a little confused?

...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.

That's enough.

I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...

I know it, I know it.

...done right, you gotta do it yourself.

The crowd bought it.

You say that like an amnesia victim.

Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.

Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..

But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.

I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten.  When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?

Are you sure?

Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..

Hmm. Not bad.

No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--

This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...

A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?

You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.

I've been looking for you.

Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...

Car wash, Captain?

The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?

My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.

How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that!

Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.

You're late. I've got some good news and some good news. I'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in.

You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...

There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up..

Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."

A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.  Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up.  Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..

I don't know what came over me.

Yeah, she's okay.

I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...

Next time, call...

Hey, Captain God!

You turned around!

Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?

Lose the smile, Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night--good food, good conversation--some Catwomen show up and it's "You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout--Oh, I'm sorry, I mean "warehouse."

You know, now that I hear myself tell it, I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What, you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday, then Brock takes it for the weekend...

It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?

A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...

Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.

I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...

Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.

Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...

I don't know if I can do it alone.

You seem sad, Spooky.

You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...

What are you doing on Theo's line?

He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.

I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!

You gotta just look the other way.

Now that'd be a misdemeanor.

Lady, don't let him do it!

Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die.  Particularly if you're not expecting it.  You don't know what hit you.

I told you I should've cuffed him.

I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.

Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.

You never miss a trick.

What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?

If you know that just back off.

He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.

And what're you whispering for?

What do they need her for?

The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.

He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.

Tell me what she looks like.

I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.

It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.

I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.

He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.

What bank?

I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?

They'll recognize it's not your husband.

What's going on?

It won't be him.

Yes?  Yes?

They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.

Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.

Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?

Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.

She'll never be the same.  None of us will.

He had a gun.  I have it now.

Whose money is this?

Damned if I know.

I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.

What's Nels' number?

Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.

Some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me.

Exactly who was this Oberfeld?

Know what else is in here?

It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.

Five ... six.

Twenty percent.

You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.

Sure.

I don't know what you mean.

That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.

Stop the crying.

Count it.

What's he doing?  Answer me!

Who am I talking to?

You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.

From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.

Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.

I'm in awe.

Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.

You could always make it up to her.

See that, Col?

He gave me a look.

Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.

You see that, Col?

Don't chuck my clothes out!

Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?

I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.

Everybody wants something.

He's getting up.

Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.

Give me that look again.

Jesus Christ!

He was different.

But you can t stay, you know that?

Shouldn't you be in mourning?

Maybe.

You mean that?

Tell him it hurt --

Sorry, darling.

You could?

Don't.

Won't be quite the same though, will it?

Don't ask me in.

No. Can't pretend that much.

So I got it wrong, then.

Dil, this is Jude.

What you doing, Jimmy?

Why?

You like me better like this.

Why?

What?

You tried.

Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.

See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.

Why?

You like me now, Jimmy?

Love me.

And you'll never leave me?

Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --

Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --

What was it?

But you know what the thing is, Fergus?

You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.

Fergus, I think you don't trust me.

Give him a cup of tea.

So?

Why?

Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus.

Why do you want to do that for?

You sure about that?

He's at home.

I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?

So what do you think that is, Hennessy?

Who is he?

Hope not.

Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.

You're going to have to do it, aren't you?

Why can't we?

What do you know about my nature?

Shut the fuck up, would you?

C'mere.

What the fuck am I doing here.

Nice to meet you, Fergus.

Can't.

Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.

Why?

Where would you most like to be now, man?

Oh, yeah.

The best.

Depends on what you believe in.

Is it bad?

You liked her?

Don't know her.

Don't think that way.

Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --

Help me.

What?

Nothing.

Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --

You stupid bastard --

Don't run off, Jude.

Not here.

Come and get me, soldier --

What are you talking about?

Oh, you should see your face.

Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?

Aren't you allowed to kiss back?

If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?

What is it?

I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.

Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.

Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.

Reggie -- stop!

Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?

Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --

You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.

Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.

And I'm afraid we want it back.

That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.

Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.

Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?

What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?

Steal it how?

We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.

C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.

We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.

No, Mrs. Lampert.

Are you sure there's no mistake?

The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.

No.

Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?

But you're -- divorced?

You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?

You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.

Back where?

Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.

Does it hurt?

Sure.

Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.

There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?

Why not a lying Blackfoot?

I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.

What day is it?

Yes, I know.

What? Assassinate somebody?

Then I suggest you call one of them.

What are you doing?

Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.

Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.

Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.

It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.

Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.

The man's the same, even if the name isn't.

Monsieur Félix -- ?

Yes.

In human life? In greed? In suffering?

The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.

I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.

You sure nuthin's missin'?

Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?

I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.

You loved him?

He was American?

Oh. Swiss. His profession?

If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.

Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?

Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?

Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?

But he is gone.

He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?

How's that?

Sorry. Which view would you like?

I'm not sure I --

Is your husband with you?

It's terrible -- you just made it up.

What are you doing here?

Doing what?

Instant divorce you mean?

Hallo, Peter.

Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.

You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.

Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'

Nothing. Good night.

What?

So they think he left it with you.

Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?

I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --

Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.

Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.

Howdy, Miz Lampert.

Stop that!

Can you give me one good reason why I should?

But why do you want a divorce?

Have you no idea who could have done it?

Do you know him?

What is it about?

Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?

Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!

We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!

Howdy, Miz Lampert.

Why?

Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.

Hi Jody.

Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?

If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.

Hi honey.

Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!

Who is she Daddy?

You were eavesdropping.

No!

What happened?

Is Jody still awake?

Can you get inside?

Is there a picture of her somewhere?

Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.

You aren't going to the party?

You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.

I don't know what I'm so scared of.

Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.

Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.

They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?

This place is empty.

I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?

Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.

Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.

Are you coming to the party?

Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.

Jody. Wait.

Go to the police station!

Mom?

I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.

I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.

I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.

What?

You're so beautiful.

Hey! That was a 3k machine.

I said no.



Come on, Night Shift.

Great. 

Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?

...moron.

Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...

Aw!  Oh, Jesus.

I need your truck.

No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...

Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.

Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.

All right.



No cell.

Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.

No, no, no.

You stole this truck!



...work!  It's not even load-...

    Elvis is on ice again.

Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.

...I'm not the psycho.

...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...

Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...

...waiting!

...up!

...Shift.



 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!

Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.

Get over!  Get over!

Come on, old Pete.  Oh.

Come on.

What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!

Ho, ho...



Yeah, he's a dangerous...



Keep still.

Oh, no!



...did you?

...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...

How wonderful for you.

...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...

 Whoo!

Arlo, shut up.





Okay. 

Okay, here we go.

Aw, shit.  Would you be more care-...

Whoo!

Shoot me. 

All right 

Come on.  Come on.

What?



...-ta get outta here!



Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!

Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.



You did help a little.

Who put the big hurt on...

...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...

 Yeah.

...face" crap you've been telling me?

...us.

Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.

You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.

 you see, that was a-that was my mission.

 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.





It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.

Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...

...take my sorry old truck.

...here.   Mason... 

Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!

Looks like it.  Yes, sir.

...-lar.

...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.

"Went away."  I like that.

Do you know what'll...

Dennis, radio the bikes.  I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...

Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.

Hit him.



This was supposed to be a...

Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay.  Fur-...

Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.

Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...

Richard Long.

Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--

You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.

...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?

....-lene.

Yeah?

Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...

...-tainer!





And don't give him any ice cream...

Oh, caught a few, lost a few.



Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?

Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?

...-time. 



...is a perfect hunter.

...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...

Cold?  Cold.  How cold?

...-m-means, Mason.  

Yeah, I just....

Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.

Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis?!

Mason.  Mason!

You find yourself wearing a...

Lying? 

...tunnel now!

 

Yeah, I'm sure.

Get in 



Arlo.

Oh.

Do it now.

I'll stay here and secure this position.

It's too late, Mason. I've...

Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?

But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.

Sir?

Always?

If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.

Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.

Oh yes.

'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.

Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?

Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?

If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.

I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?

Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.

I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.

Just find the girl.

An obituary column... can you read in this light?

What does this mean?

Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?

Hello.

What are you talking about?

She's just no good.

What's that, Curly?

I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.

What kind of guy do you think I am?

Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?

In the garage.

Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.

I'll throw that in too.

So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.

That's a filthy habit.

Then what'll you do?

I'm not.

You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now.  And I'm out of Chinatown.

Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?

I don't want it anymore.

What are you doing here?

This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.

Well, let's go.

Give you three minutes.

No.

A complete surprise?

Iced tea.

So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?

You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.

Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --

No. I went riding rather early.

Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.

Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.

You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.

I can't tell you.

I mean I can't tell you.

You seem to have had a reason for every other question.

You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.

You sure shout that?

That dam is a con job.

Know him?

We got it. We got it, baby.

There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.

It was in Chinatown.

What's wrong?

This morning.

She's too upset.

I can't...

I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?

Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?

I said the truth!

...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...

...where does Kyo live?

On his day off. Get the exact address.

How do you know?

Walsh here?

Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.

Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?

Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.

I'm sorry. We don't.

He never even kids about it.

Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.

Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?

I don't understand.

You're a married man, am I right?

Have we ever met?

The water.

Gittes?... Gittes?

This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.

Mr. Mulwray, please.

Gittes.

Gee whiz.  And I'm late.

Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.

He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.

How did they get it away from him?

This?

What about?

Apple core?

Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.

Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.

Yeah?

What's that, pal?

Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?

Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?

Course, she settled down nicely.

Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.

Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!

Will they really find work in Germany?

It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.

Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.

Yes. I want proof.

But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!

Hi, Elena!

No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 

Father, I have sinned...

No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.

No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?

It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.

I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?

Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 

He sure did, Mr. Kane.

My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -

So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -

I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?

Go in and ask him to hurry.

He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?

Yes, very!  Naturally.

Who else you been to see?

Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.

Sure, sure.

I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!

Do you, Mr. Leland?

Do we stand for the same things that the "Chronicle" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?

Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic.  I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.

But, Mr. Kane -

Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!

But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.

Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.

What story, Mr. Rogers?

You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.

I know that, Emily -

What's this all about, Emily?  I've had a very tiring day and -

Oh!!

Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -

I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea -

Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.

A chicken?

I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.

Would you sing for me?

Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!

You'll never have another chance to hit me again.  I never knew till this minute -

Don't tell me you're sorry.

Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only we're talking now about what you are.  That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table.  I'm fighting for my life.  Not just my political life.  My life.  If your husband is elected governor -

You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why don't you -

I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.

But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -

Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -

You goin', Mom?

Is Mrs. Kane - 

Close the door, Raymond.

I mean I've got a job for you.

You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken."  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?

There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.

What?

Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -

That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?

Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.

What check?

Oh, yes, the bonus.

You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -

David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 

Brief marriage!  Ten years! 

I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.

On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?

I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.

Yes, and maybe he didn't.

I know, but -

You can go on asking questions if you want to.

Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?

Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?

That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.

Excuse me, but...

Maybe you should take that coffee outside.

If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.

She said not to come home until graduation.

You can hold me down.

So where is he?

Why aren't there any lights?

Territoriality. He was mine first.

My God. I haven't seen you since... 

Well... kind of, sort of?

I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?

The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.

I'm giving him his ring back.

I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...

I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.

Good. Stay in that frame of mind.

Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.

I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.

How'd you get here so fast?

Well he asked me for it!

Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.

If you can just wait a few more minutes.

Someone jammed gum in the locks.

Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees. He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday.  I tore up his membership.

Want something to drink? I'm buying.

She called me.

One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.

In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.

Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?

They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.

...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.

I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.

Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.

What's that?

So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.

You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...

Why doesn't he just mix and match?

Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.

There aren't.

He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?

At least we're stuck here together.

He's blunt, but he's got a point.

Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 

What happened to all the Gatorade?

You know what Sanford told me? 

Jesus.

I'm gonna go to her wake.

You hardly knew her!

Stop it. This is beneath even you.

Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.

I can't close the store.

That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.

No!

Who found him?

I could never reach.

I know it was a bad idea to close the store.

Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?

May I be blunt with you?

That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.

Get to work.

Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.

Then how come you got the fine?

You're lying.

Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?

You're happy?

Now I know you're lying.

Wow. You've had quite an evening.

Hey, what about Veronica?

You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?

All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.

I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.

Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?

She said she did all the work.

All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.

I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.

Am I right or what?

What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.

You still didn't have to choke me.

To talk to you.

No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.

Yes, they are. You're out of shape.

Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?

Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?

What? When? When did all this shit happen?

And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.

All right. How much is Pepsi here?

Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.

Be careful.

Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.

Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.

I said go ahead.

All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?

Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...

All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.

Don't you have a hockey game at two?

You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?

What were you doing up so late?

What? What is that?

How much money did you leave up there?

You're trusting.

You were making a generalization about "broads!"

Why'd you hit me?

Three?

They put up the least amount of struggle.

Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?

Sylvan can be talked into anything.

Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...

How many?

Well...?

What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?

A fine, for five hundred dollars.

I didn't do that!

Check this out, he's from Russia.

What did he say?

Did he say "making fuck?"

What part of Russia?

He really wants to play metal?

Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?

I think the lady called it.

It's probably from being around all this food every day.

You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!

Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?

Really?

I beg your pardon!

Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.

No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!

Did I hear somethin' break? Outside left!

Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.

That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?

Looks like the Tower.  It's a bad climb.

I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.

Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--

I'm coming out!

What the hell are you doing here?!

You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.

Room service...Hi, Sarah.

How're ya feeling?

Two...

That's a virtue isn't it?

Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.

Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?

Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.

And I can't leave.

If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.

I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--

Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?

Gabe...your arm?

Nice view, huh?

What was God thinking when he built this place?

Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.

Never, what?!

Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.

Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.

Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?

The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.

You said there was a way across.

Travers, you're not running things.

No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!

What's your names?

Then where the fuck is!

Why?  What are you going to do?!

Is it set?

Why the hell are we wasting time here?!

Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.

Mostly.  Armored cars can be hijacked.  Trains can be derailed.  But nobody can get to us in flight.

I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.

Come on, Alex. Come for walkies. Hahahahaha.

I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?

Good evening, sir.

No, my health doesn't allow it.

I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!

I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.

Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.

Fine, sir, fine.

Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?

The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.

So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?

You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?

Do you feel that way now?

Do you still feel suicidal?

We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.

Who said that?

Not feeling too bad now are you?

Thank you, sir.

As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.

What about Basil? Where's my snake?

What do I want?

Blue eyes?

Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?

Have you ever had any mental illness?

Are you an Epileptic?

No, sir.

No, sir.

Fine... fine.

Oh no, nothing of the sort.

Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.

Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.

Are you referring to the background score?

I'm your Psychiatrist.

No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?

Isn't the plumage beautiful?

Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.

You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. I've learned my lesson, sir. I see now what I've never seen before I'm cured, praise Bog!

You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.

Father, I have tried, have I not?

Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.

One shirt - blue, collar attached.

One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.

Mothballs, sir.

Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?

D'you think we should do something?

Hullo, son, how are you?

Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.

The ride is free.

Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.

It's no big deal.

You never answered my question.  You like what you do?

You need a vacation.

Annie...it's Max.

A deer?

Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.

...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.

Get outta here!  You and Louis?

And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.

Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?

The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.

Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.

...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...

Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...

...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...

What are you gonna do?

...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?

Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.

Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.

Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.

Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.

Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?

I was with Max when he got the call.

Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.

I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!

Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.

...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...

Mind if I time you?  What do I get if you're wrong?  A free ride?

First time in New York?

You should start a union.

Why not?

Oh?  How long you been doing this?

You - you killed him?

You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.

What?

Max.

You listening to me?

How about the thingy next to it?

Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.

I can't believe this.

I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.

Who's that?

So what?

Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...

Let's go.

Max?  What are you doing?

Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.

Show up for what?

Show up for <u>what?</u>

Limos, huh?

Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.

What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.

Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?

Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?

I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.

The man who hired me for this contract.

In case he asks.

Would you have called her?

Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?

Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway...

Head towards Union Station.

How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.

Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?

Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.

What're you thinking, Jerry?

Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.

Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.

Saved you last night's, too.

Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?

Not for years.

You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?

I better get going.

You switched the charts; you tell me.

You saved my life.

Yes.

Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.

That's it?

You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.

Here it is.  <u>Conspiracy Theory</u>  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.

'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'

Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?

You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?

Was that who I thought it was?

Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.

Did you see the van back there?

You haven't been bothering them, have you?

Cold War's over, Jerry.

And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.

They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!

Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?

You look great.

We're going to Queens?

After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.

How'd you get the picture?

You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.

Without a song in my heart.

Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?

Do I know you?

Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?

You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.

I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?

And you feel bad for it?

And you have no idea where he lives?

Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.

If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?

Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.

Where'd you get it?

Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.

So, you doing anything tonight?

Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.

It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.

Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?

Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.

Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.

Can I talk to you a second?

Do you believe me?

What gave me away?

No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?

What?

Is it possible...?

You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?

Dr. Arroway --

Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.

And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --

No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.

Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.

... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...

Do you have a minute -- ?

David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...

Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...

And?

Got a bogey, boss?

Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.

Dr. Cullers?

I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.

Pardon me, but you can't do -- !

Please answer the question, Doctor.

But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.

So.  What happens now?

Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.

That isn't the way it works.

No more stalling, Captain.

You live here.

What kind of deal?

What's that?

It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.

What are you talking about?  It's over.

You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?

I'd say this is slightly different.

I thought you were here because you want to go.

I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.

... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar...  God, I've missed you.

Greenbank?

Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.

Someone tell me this is really happening.

Ellie -- are you okay?

So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?

I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.

I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.

Do you really believe your life is meaningless?

... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.  How did you do it?  How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?

Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...

You're trembling.

Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.

They don't believe me.

I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.

Oh my God...

I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.

Yeah.

Lookit her bounce.

Gotta have kings.

Tell us about it.

What's all this dirt in the yard?

Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...

Here's the Patrol.

Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.

Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.

Man, this here Newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself Luke don't know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.

Lucille? Where do you get that?

Nuthin'! A handfull of nuthin'!  You stupid mullet-head. He beat you with nuthin'! Just like today when he kept coming back at me.

They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.

What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.

Don't hit me no more, Boss! Don't hit me! I'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! Oh Luke. You are an original, you truly are. You really fooled them.

Luke. Where you goin?

Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.

I'm in.

Cuter again.

Kick a buck.

You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back.

He'll never make it.

He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.

I hate this...

Now look what you did.

It's good medicine.

Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...

I got it myself... I couldn't wait.

I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.

Oh God.  I'm really crazy.

But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.

I want to die.

I can't, Andy.

She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?

Yes.  Without question.

He was lying.

The first two murders.

He told me he had done two others just like it.

Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.

Hello, Daryll Lee.

I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.

I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.

I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.

You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.

Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.

Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.

Who?

Because of your phone calls.

Would you want to work with us on this?

Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.

Is it an ongoing case?

Why imitate a dead serial killer?

Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.

It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.

There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.

You're afraid of him.

What's that siren?

Who's the married man?

Maybe you should...

How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?

You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.

Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.

Open the door.  Please.

He was in my apartment!

You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...

Hello.  I am  Meryhew Saks.  The song is called "Murder By Numbers."  The performers are a group called The Police.  Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note.  This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers.  We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims.  We have a team sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want to say a few word to you local people.  Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.  The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year.  We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy.  Together we can be unbeatable.  Which one is Inspector Halloran?

We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?

I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.

Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.

If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?

You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.

I heard. Good police work.

Absolutely.

Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.

The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.

I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...

I'm <U>telling</u> you.  Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work.

Sergeant?

You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?

Oh, maaaaan?!

So what have we got?

What the hell you need her for?

Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?

How'd you get in on the deal?

You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...

That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?

She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?

Where were you?

Poor darling.  What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.

I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.

You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?

After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one?  I'm trying to find Charles's car.

Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?

Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?

Please finish your story.

And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?

Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...

I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.

I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.

What?

It was just a little going-away gesture.

How can I help?

You did the right thing.

My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.

Tell us every detail.

Oh no.

Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.

Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.

Ruth's already taken him home.

We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.

I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.

Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...

Must you walk so quickly?

Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?

I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.

I don't mean to go on and on like this.

Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?

What if it's got a pattern?

Hey there. They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you...

A daisy for the lady.

Thanks.    Where've you been all day?

Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.

It's a good thing my family loves you.

Well?

Tell me all.

So there were no problems?

Just checking.

This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.

I love your apartment.

Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?

I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.

The store was busy.

You're going to miss the Top Ten.

Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?

Something like that.

Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.

I guess we need to talk.

I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.

I guess I should go now.

But what about that math project?

Forget I asked.

You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?

Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?

Yes, I suppose so.

I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?

Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.

It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.

Getting back.

Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.

Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.

What are you doing?

Where are the tapes?

A pass.

You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.

What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?

Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?

Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?

A million! I don't have that kind of money.

You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.

-- Super what?

I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.

Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?

But you were there?

They knew who you were when they broke in your house?

And for my help I would get what?

Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.

No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.

Why not just steal another one?

Why is everything an argument with you?

Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!

In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.

Hopefully no one.

We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.

I thought they came with batteries.

Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.

That moron.

Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?

You're sure?

I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.

This is Zero.

How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?

What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.

Guns.   Can you get them?

A thousand dollars?

Hey boss, it's not a science.

Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.

Just find them!

But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.

What'd you guys find?

What do we do?

No, I didn't.

No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.

I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?

How about Canada?

You lived there. You know the city.

I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!

I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.

He speaks about himself in the third person?

I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.

The money isn't here.

It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.

You like shoes?

The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.

Casandra. Old girlfriend?

Did she break your heart?

Sounds boring.

Who are you waiting for?

She seems pleasant enough.

What's this?

You're back!

Who are you?

I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.

Yes.

Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?

Who are you?  Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?

You don't seem to understand.

Please sit.

I'll socialize with whomever I please.

I'm tired now.

It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.

But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.

Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?

You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.

I've missed you.

I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.

I'll give them to you.

You know about Lo?

You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!

Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.

Let's stop a moment.

I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.

When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.

Mu Bai...It's been too long.

Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.

You were enlightened?

No, not yet...

That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.

Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.

Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.

What happened?

Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.

No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.

It's Jade Fox!

If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.

Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.

This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.

Could be.

Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass."

Thank you.  For giving a damn.

They couldn't do anything for me.

You sorta looked like you might need my help.

You're welcome.

Don't interfere.

Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?

Does she have a name?

I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?

What's goin' on, Elly?

Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.

You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?

I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.

How the hell did you do that?

Miss her?

Get it?

Coupla more rings... 24k.

...necklace... pearls...

That thing is poisonous.

His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.

No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?

Annette, how long have we known each other?

So what year are you going into?

I read your teen beat manifesto.

I must say I found it rather appalling.

Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?

Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.

Romantic? He rapes her.

How's the water?

That's also none of your business.

And you promise to abide by it?

Sure. Have a good night.

It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?

It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.

Why are you trying to hurt me?

My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.

What do you mean?

Are you shitting me?

I'm in the bath, mom.

So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.

That's great.

That's so romantic. Have you responded?

Well do you like him?

So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.

Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.

So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.

It's like a secret society.

What are you doing?

Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.

And then I can go home?

What are you doing?

Want a blow job?

And you haven't made an ounce of progress.

This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.

My daughter, Rachel.

Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.

Good luck, Sebastian.

Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.

-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.

Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.

Is she with you?

McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.

What do you do? Tell her you love her.

Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?

Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.

I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.

Why not?

I'll think about it...

I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.

In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.

Fuck her yet?

Loser.

Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.

Who are you calling?

Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.

That her?

Shut up.

Tell me all the details.

Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.

Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.

At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.

Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.

Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?

Ronald?

Get off me!

Not at all. What's wrong?

Ronald? That's crazy.

I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.

I'll do that.

Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -

Right after we played backgammon.

Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.

Did she show up?

Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.

Kathryn. Did you hit her?

Ronald, I'm sorry.

to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --

You get your wish!

Did you ever make a wish?

Did your wishes ever come true?

The Farren house

No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.

Well  the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.

Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.

No.  It's not that.  It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.

Where is everybody?

Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,

I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.

Ollie.

It's your play.

Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.

What's funny?

But I told her to go with you.

I got lots of presents.

Is that my birthday cake? May I see?

Certain wishes do.

What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?

Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?

No, I didn't.

It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!

She's there, just like I said she'd be.

Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.

Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.

Daddy?

My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?

We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.

Irena. But who are you?

You'll always play with me?

I shall wear it in my hair!

Merry Christmas.

So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.

You?

A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?

Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.

I wasn't singing to myself.

Because it can't. It's dead.

I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.

But I only came to give back the ring.

I like stories.

He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.

And does he kill people?

Hide me? Why?

Hurry!

Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?

And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!

There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.

You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.

I'm lucky Jen's not like that.

No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.

No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.

A dog at Victoria's Secret?

And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.

Translation: a total geek.

He hasn't said one word to me.

Can't you get contacts?

I think she broke the skin.

He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?

So did you do it?

Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.

At least your PMS is over.

I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.

Are those Mark's?

I wonder if he's married.

I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?

I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.

Charming Carlton.

So where's this infamous arm now?

And what makes you think you killed a man?

You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?

You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.

Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?

DON'T call the police.

There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.

How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?

Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.

What choice do we have?

About Benito.

So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "Son, you got into Harvard!" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating.

You don't have to pee.

Uh huh. So pee.

Script coverage?

No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.

I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.

You wanna get some coffee?

Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.

Oh, it's nothing.

It's stupid.

Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?

I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.

Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.

Is that how you feel?

You know, I've never seen your cat.

Your breasts feel larger.

Hello?

You at least owe me the truth.

If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.

Be careful!

I knew you wouldn't kill me.

That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.

Yes... I... we had dinner.

A kiss? Did you have sex with him?

We can get a warrant if you like.

No, I have a cat.

How the hell is that your business?

I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?

Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.

Hey, there was a lot of blood.

Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?

Madonna's in Penthouse?

She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.

Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.

Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.

Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.

It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.

Did we get those DNA tests back?

Sell maps?

Police.  Nobody move.

Doctor!  What brings you here?

I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...

Was that for real down there?

Itís extremely important to my investigation...

Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?

Do you wash your hands before you type things?

I need everything on the Jonathan White case.

Where do you think this goes?

Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.

Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...

But...  How long has this been happening?

You see it?

I see.  The verdict, yes...

I didn't realise...

Water?

Known me for long?

Don't say a .

Right and don't embellish.

Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'

Lots of shelters were in this bill.

... what?

Where's the girl?

I don't give a shit.

Till what?

Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.

Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.

When does it break?

Alan, we still have to control this guy...

What's with the cameras?

It's not his job -- It's my job!

Uh-oh...

Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?

I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.

They could put you in jail.

I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.

Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.

It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.

You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...

Presence.

I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.

Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?

Fine.

What do you mean you made it all up?

`Dave'?

Yes, but I wouldn't...

This is from the people of Burundi...

What are they?

Something like what...

The Fidelity nonsense...

Yeah.

Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...

Your government needs your help.

So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?

You ever use it?

Didn't mean to bum you out.

You sure you don't want a lift back home?

Look.  If there was some mistake...

So what do you do the rest of the time?

Yes.

It was okay?

What's wrong?

Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.

We're all set,  sir.

Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please.

His madness....could be from shock.

I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!

You'd hold us back. We have to go on.

Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's

Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.

We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!

Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.

Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!

How long do we have to watch him?

Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?

This stuff really works? No shit?

That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!

I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...

Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours.

You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.

I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.

No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.

You know how many demerits we're talking?

All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.

Why doesn't he let you do what you want?

Can you believe it?  She was gonna call me!  She invited me to a party with her!

So?

He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.

Yaa, I'm a dead poet!

Oh God, it's over now!

Mr. Keating!

You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?

It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?

Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?

Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.

No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.

Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.

Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying

Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?

What are you going to do? - Charlie?

What are you doing?!

Hello?

Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.

Knox, I don't believe this!

Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.

Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?

Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-

What is that?

The hoi polloi.  Doesn't it mean the herd?

A yawp?

Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!

Come on boys, don't be shy.

Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?

Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me.

Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?

Any group pictures in the annual?

When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.

You know what this means to your mother, don't you?

I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?

Beyond the stream.  I think I know.

Why'd you leave Balincrest?

Want to come to the study group?

A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?

And now he will?

Come on, that's impossible.

But if he said no before then...

Neil, how are you gonna do this?

It's not going to help us!

And no questions asked.

Where are my men?

I'm not staying here!

What are those things?

You don't have to be so touchy.

Self sufficient...

I don't know where it is!

Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.

What is it?

How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right?

You want ME to go up there?

Let's just keep going.

The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...

Shut up! You hear me!!

Finnegan, what the hell was that?

Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!

You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...

You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?

Where are you going?

Check it out!

She fucked us both.

Fucking women, man...

You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.

I'll get the boots.

Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!

Nick's going?

This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.

It's gotta be the next one. I mean it's gotta be! Right, Albert?

Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?

Then what's the gun for! What's this for?

In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!

Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married!

I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.

Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.

Did you ever think life would turn out like this?

I have to go.

Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?

Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --

Wait! First I give you special fuck!

She's in back.

How was huntin'?

Boy, do I love this conflict. Huh?... What the hell were you doin' in there?

Vince. Hey, you guys --

Where's it gone?

Rough, huh?

No?

Why?... What do you mean?... Why???

Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.

Linda...

I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because...

What?

How are you?

You seem... disturbed.

Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?

Playing?

How extremely clever. That is really most extraordinaire... Allow me please to introduce myself. I am Armand... And you are?

You think about it?

Fucking A.

You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.

Promise! You gotta promise!

It's ahead, by the tree.

Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.

Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.

Oh. You know. How's it with you?

What's that noise?

Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!

I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.

Well, who'd you get married to?

How's it feel, huh? How's it feel to be back?

I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --

No!

Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!

Six or eight.  And they go wild?

You're full of shit!

The fuck I did!!!

Down I would say... What would you say?

Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.

Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.

My man Dubbs.

I want to ask you a few questions.

I'm not on the force anymore.

Mug sheets.

Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.

I'm wasting time.

That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.

Kill him... kill him.

Sir, your transmission's fading.

You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.

You okay?

You sure?  I can help you.

Nobody's looking.

I drive.

I'm ready.

Got it.  Ejection seat?

I'll inform dispatch.

We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.

Yeah.

Hey, I'm eating.

Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?

You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?

But he was such a good cop.

You all right?

You could always take it off.

Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.

Let's dance together -- Belle.

What are those people doing there? What do they want?

You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?

That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?

No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?

Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!

Daniel give me that beanshooter!

But I like the new one better.

Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?

Say ... about the interest ...

Loan shark -- hey?

What Grange?

What's the matter with you?

Afraid ... of what?

Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.

It's mine?

No, no! Give it to me!

What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.

I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...

Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.

Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!

You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?

Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!

Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.

Dan'l Webster?

Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?

Down, Shep! Down!

He's stubborn as a Stone.

Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.

I'll get the doctor.

Mary -- what would you do?

I'm serious.

Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.

Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --

Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.

Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?

Jabez -- Jabez!

You know that, son.

Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.

Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!

Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.

It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.

Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.

I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.

Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?

Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.

You go down and see what's keeping Dorothy.

Hello, Sheriff.

It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.

What's that?

It is.

Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 

Jabez ...

There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?

Someone to see you, Dan'l!

It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster.

Say, that's pretty good, young man.

I wanted to give it all to the church.

No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...

I can't be honest with them.

The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?

'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.

Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.

How 'bout some Christmas music?

So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms.  Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?

You're all right, Argyle.

One of yours?

John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...

Hope I'm not interrupting...?

I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?

I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --

It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.

I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --

Bad for your health anyway.

Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.

That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.

I...have a request.

Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?

I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --

I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.

The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.

Yeah?  What's the odds?

Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?

I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?

What's going on?

I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.

I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?

Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.

Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.

What guns?

I'll kiss the baby for you.

Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?

So... that sure is something.

I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.

So!  Sal is with you?

Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!

I gotta listen to it if they think...

I don't have a choice.

Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?

If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?

You try calling the police?

What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.

You alone, or you got confederates?

Sonny-boy, one word?

How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?

Okay, give us the women.

You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.

You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?

Calm down, you're not ...

I want a helicopter to get outa here!  And a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  Outa the country, so no little jets.  A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.

You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...

Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...

All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...

Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...

Yeah?

I want to talk to him.

Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!

This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!

To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.

What?

Why the hell did he do that?  What the hell did I do?

I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.

You know ... I like you people ... I really do.

Are you a lawyer?

You got Bank Americard?

I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him.

How did you know your son was involved?

When was the last time you saw Sal?

Did you always call him Junior.

Do you remember anything else about Sal?

He's gone?

Sal, I'm sorry about this.  But we can get outta this thing.  There's a way outta this.

I want him to think that.

Okay, Sal ... what do we do?

I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...

Sonny -

Nobody give their right name ... it's the FBI!

Okay - you got your one.

That's the jet.  You give us one more, now.  That's the deal...

I ain't eaten all day.  I just realized it.

Hey, let's get ready!

Not now, Mom, please.

You could give up.

Morning.

<i>They can do subtitles.</i>

I LOVE YOU, DOMINO.

Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take a look at the bathroom window?

Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.

I'm so sorry to be bothering you in the middle of the night like this... but it's a bit of an emergency.

You're breaking up... I can't hear you.

I've already formulated a plan.

Where are you? <b> INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN -- NEXT </b> Claremont is behind the Wheel of a BLACK CHEVY SUBURBAN. He pulls into the Texaco parking lot.

Hello?

Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?

You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.

LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!

<i>After dad passed on, Mum's agenda was to hit the town and find another husband with a boatload of cash.</i> <b> INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- EVENING </b> Sophie is dolled up for a night on the town... CLEAVAGE spilling out of her cocktail dress. Domino is feeding her pet GOLDFISH. "THUNDERBIRDS" plays on the television.

The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.

I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.

Cunt.

What the... <i>who is this bitch?</i> <b> EXT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT </b> Ed and Choco exit the El Camino just as Domino retrieves her knife from the windshield. She grips it in her right hand... threatening them.

So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter?

Really? Did you play in a band?

Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please!

Not really.

They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright?

Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.

I don't like anything else.

Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.

I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.

Talk to me.

I own a brownstone on this block.

I'm gonna leave now.

That's not even true.  I just want a slice.

So?

And I--we--want some Black people up.

How come you ain't got no brothers up?

How long?

I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often.

I said my name is Eddie Lovell.

I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.

No.

Innocent!

You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.

Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.

This might take some time.

That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!

Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.

I'll do.

You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.

It's Miller time.  Let me go give these Koreans s'more business.

Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?

Mookie, what took you so long?  I got a business to run.

Sal, can you do me a favor?

I'm not guilty of nuthin'.

It's supposed to be even hotter today.

No.  What are you gonna do?

Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.

Mookie?

I know I haven't seen you in four days.  I'm a working man.

Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.

Tina, you are too slick.

I've been working hard, getting paid.

And I really wanted some ice cream too.

You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.

Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--

You talk to 'em.

Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?

That's what you think?

Pino, I work hard like everybody in here.

Whaddup.  Money?

See, Pop.  That's just what I was talkin' about.  Every single time you tell Pino to do something, he gives it to me.

Me and you are gonna have a talk.

Some are OK.

Hey!  Watch it.

Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.

I should have Vito go with you all the time.

Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on...  See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders.  He's making us lose business.

Pop asked you.

Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a place of business.

Yeah, we're closed. So go away.

Excuse me.

Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?

Hey guys.

HARRY!

You did?

Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...

Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal.

Would you like something to drink?

Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.

HARRY? Are you okay?

Okay.

The name's Walter.

Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?

Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?

Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.

You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!

You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.

God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly.

No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.

Whoa. What was that?

You take that back!

Where did you learn that word?

Collins is a great man!

I didn't know that.

A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.

Can he do that?

Sorry about that Harry, first time I've brought a friend up there. You okay?

Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".

HARRY, can you hear me?

Do you want me to pet your head?

Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?

George Washington!

If you have to ask, you don't know.

PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!

You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.

I made the polar bear pants.

I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.

That's what Jessica was talking about!

Guys, this is much better.

Start the tape, Lloyd.

Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!

The one on the left.

Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.

So what did you say to my parents on the phone?

Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!

Why ith dat newth?

Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.

Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.

Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?

Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?

My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.

Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching.

Obviously.

I am strong!

It's the big potato.

Guess what"s under these coconuts.

Where is it?

It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.

What happens now?

A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!

Yes?

The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.

What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.

We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".

Things have been so serious here lately.

Don't you trust your own eyes.

Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?

Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.

I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.

Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/

Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.

Stop him yourself.

Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?

Spice!... pure un-refined spice!

We call that one Muad'dib.

Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure.

What's in the box?

Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?

Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!

... Many men have tried.

Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.

Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.

Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>!  It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!

So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!

Why were you buying a coffin?

I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.

Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.

They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!

I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.

But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?

Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.

Is there anything I can get you? Water?  A blanket?

"Greetings.  I am the Count."

Bela, are you ready?

In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.

Goddamn, it's cold!

Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.

Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?

So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?

Oh.  So what is the scene about?

And, cut...

So guess where I'm going next weekend?

Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!

PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!

You really think so?

What do you think you're doin'?!

Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?

I don't understand.

There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.

We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.

Sweetie, you won't believe it!  I've got the most incredible news!

Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!

Close!  The <u>other</u> one!

How long have you been doing this?

Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?

It's a damn good role.

How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?

From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.

I'm no good.

Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.

Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.

Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.

For this one, we need $60,000.

Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!

Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.

He's a <u>bum</u>.

Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.

Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're in a trance.  You glide in and get on the operating table.  Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down.  But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.

Hey!  You're not eatink.

Tor, I should be getting home.

Can I help you?

Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.

I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.

"Where's the ads"?!  The ads are in Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri!  You schmuck, it ain't gonna play L.A.!

Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.

Oh.  Okay.

The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?

You should feel lucky.  Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.

I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?

Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat --

I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."

Ed, you said you were getting permission.

Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?

Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.

Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!

I thought this was a group effort.

Why... yes.

Please, be compassionate.  I'm your husband!

Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!

ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.

No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.

Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?

Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...

They celebrated the common person.

Jeanette, you're hurting me.

How's your mother?

It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.

What?!

Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.

I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.

They tore her dress! ...

I don't think so.

I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.

What?

We're the guys who clean up after the parade.

Send him away.

No. It's a mess.

I don't want to -- do you know where he is?

Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.

He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.

Eddie...

I'm at the hospital.

He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.

Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.

Hi, Mom. 

She won't.

I can't?

Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?

Are you asking me?

Don't defend that horse's ass to me.

Ha!

I mean bad.

I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!

Really?

I wish my stepfather was here.

Where?

Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.

No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.

You see how people look at me. Like when they ask for my autograph or say "Hi" to me... It's like I'm a basketball player or a... you know, like I'm someone.

This is going right up your ass.

Kinda'.

What's up?

I'm making a tape.

I got your message. Way to go!

I'm doing all right.

That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.

Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?

What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.

Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.

You brought the girl!

What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --

Ray, where do you keep the glasses?

Hello.

No. Two times.

The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...

Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.

That girl's an idiot.

Hi.

Um... They gave me a limo, uh...

Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?

You're not just jealous, are you?  I mean, we both used to talk about her

No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.

Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!

Good morning, Mr. McAllister.

Well, good luck there, Tracy

Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.

I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!

Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.

Looks good to me.

NO, that's fine

You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?

Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.

Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!

Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?

You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.

This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.

Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.

Hello, Mr. M.

Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place

Where to?

What's this?

Jim, where the hell have you been?

Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that.  Right, Jim?

Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.

And how did you get in the school?

After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.

Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.

More this way.

I can't afford this stuff right now.

So what do you think?  Should we get a room?

points at the motel.

Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.

Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.

We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?

She's doing this to get back at me

We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just --

Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.

Yeah.

Yes, Paul?

I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -

Merry Christmas.

Somebody hit you?

Can I get you a drink?

Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?

How'd she meet Patchett?

Do you enjoy it?

Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.

He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?

You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want.

Did you talk to Exley?

In the morning.

Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?

He helped me out once.  That's all.

How what, Wendell?

You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.

I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 

Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.

Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.

Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.

What's through here?

It all keeps coming back to Dudley.

Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.

You expecting problems?

We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.

They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.

I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?

Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.

Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?

What do you want to know?

Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.

What do you mean?

Anything?

Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --

Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?

Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?

Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?

And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?

Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.

Okay.  Okay.  Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks.  From aviation, freeway construction.  But the man has hobbies, too.  He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers. And try this on:  he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer.  All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o.

Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.

You're wrong.

Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.

Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.

It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.

You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.

L.A.P.D.

She is Lana Turner.

We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.

I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.

For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.

You sound like you mean it.

You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.

You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.

Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.

If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.

Do you think I ever could've been in the running?

Do you have any proof?

It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them.  The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere.  You like it, Jackie- Boy?

<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.

Shut up!

Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.

Really?  How?

I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.

DePinto's dead.

And you were the last one to talk to him.

What'd he give to you?

Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.

You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?

I don't know what that means.

I don't know what that--

What if--

I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.

Jesus!

Sorry.

I didn't use my name.

They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.

It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.

That is one ugly sunrise.

They're here.

Them.

Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.

What the fuck?!

Gimme that.

We lost 'em.

Fuckin-A.

Same thing?

Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--

Reynolds.

He came in four minutes ago.

Baudmore Consultants.

Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--

Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff.

Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.

Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?

You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.

How 'bout Christian Dior?

What size?

What size?

I know, but--

Because my life is being ruined.

You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--

Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?

Did he give you anything?

Was he with anyone?

You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?

What?

How'd you get the information on DePinto?

You <u>swore</u>!

You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.

Oh, please--

I know, but listen--

Is Eric in school?

I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

I was missing you.

Is it over?

Who?

You're goddam right you jumped the gun.

Actually, that's not true.

No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.

And then what?

Never.

Thank you.

I know.

My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.

I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--

He didn't <u>give</u> me--

Otherwise you may have to what?

Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.

A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.

Bobby--

I don't under--

Who won the fight?

Yeah.

No.

They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.

He's heard that it's escalated.

Jerry--

The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--

Yeah?

It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--

It's been a few years.

I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--

Tell me about it.

Are you okay?

Yeah.

Am I to understand--

If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.

We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.

Yes?

Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?

They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?

Which stall?

What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?

What else?

Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!

Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.

I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.

What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?

Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?

Don't you know you drove everybody mad?

I'm sorry, Katharine.

What kind of photographs?

Safe journey.

Have you seen Katharine?

It's Geoffrey under this.

Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?

I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -

You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.

I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.

Why do they care about our maps?

We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.

I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.

Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -

What do you want?

They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg inhave you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?

I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.

I could help you.  I could get you off that.

It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -

Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright?

Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.

I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.

Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?

So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.

What did you say?

And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?

Marvelous plane.  Did you look?

Excuse me -

He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.

I'll probably marry him.

I liked it better when there were just the two of us.

Arguing about books.

You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.

What do I do?

What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?

Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.

If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?

I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.

It's what I've learned.

I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.

He's gone, hasn't he?

Hello.

You've got a mustache.

I thought that was for when we were very very old?

Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!

Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.

I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.

How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.

Kip?

Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.

No.

Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.

You didn't answer the beeper either.

Meaning--

We've got to catch him in the act.

In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?

How about if I try humility.

You have a car?

Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?

I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.

Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.

We going somewhere?

You want me to pick up a painting?

Those are my clothes.

You stole my luggage? You--

Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?

I know it well.

We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?

I go in alone.

I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.

I'll need that.

Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?

A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.

So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.

Why don't we take oxygen?

Got it.

You bought this for me?

To us. To the Mask.

Aren't we all.

Camera in the--

One, two, three...

Careful...careful.

You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.

I like banks.  That's where the money is.

Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?

I'll need the Rembrandt now.

The Mask. Where is it?

Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?

Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.

What's that?

Got it.

For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.

How do I look?

Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...

Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.

Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?

You have something in mind?

But would you--would you--

Put this on!

It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.

You two make quite a couple.

This is just show and tell.

My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.

You'll just have to have faith.

... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --

Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.

250,000?

What's she doing here?

Fax these to this number, okay?

Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?

How does someone get meningitis?

Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.

You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.

Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.

An on-site monitoring well?  That means --

Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.

Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea.  You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?

It's a good day.  I feel good.

Five million dollars?

I'm sorry, Erin.

I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --

Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.

Now, why in the hell would you assume that?

So what made you think it was?

I want a raise.  And benefits.  Including dental.

Then I don't get anything either.

Bullshit.

How many families we talking about here?

This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.

Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.

Oh, they knew.  They had to know.

I like this case.

Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.

Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.

What kind of truck?

Whoa.  No shit.

Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.

Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?

Why good?

She insulted me!

Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --

If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.

Wait, what do you mean, ten years?

When?  Where?

Fuck Kurt.

I don't know what to say.

I did.  Both.

Ed, I swear, I'm not --

When'd they file the demur?

How many counts?

Who's the judge?

I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.

And you were told to destroy those?

Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?

You've been reading for hours.

Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick day.

PG& -- Are you sure?

Well, hello to you, darlin'.

Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.

I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.

Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?

What're you doing?

You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?

What are you doing here?

What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?

George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it?

If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.

I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?

What's going on?  What are you doing?

I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.

You already packed up your stuff?

Thank you.

Hello?

I don't do favors for you anymore.

And I miss you.

I'm embarrassed.

Someone stole my stuff.

-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.

You know that thing it says in here about rashes?

It'll be fine, yeah.

Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  Shanna and Ashley?

... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.

I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.

Soon, Lord Vader.

Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.

Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.

You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.

Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.

Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.

I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.

... the power?

Give me that!

Mine, mine.

Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?

We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...

The temperature is dropping too fast.

I have felt it.

With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.

Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.

What are you so grouchy about?

You, too, golden rod.

Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.

This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.

That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....

Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.

That depends.  Where are we?

I don't like this.

Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.

About what?

Are you kidding?

How's your mining operation going?

All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?

What about Leia and the Wookiee?

That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.

We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.

Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?

.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.

Look, I stand to lose everything by this.

Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.

You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.

The deflector shields are gone.

The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.

We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.

Two transports at a time is awfully risky.

Jabba the Hutt?

Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.

Okay.  I'll give it a try.

That they are.

No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.

But how am I to know the good side from the dark?

Four this time!  The Force you feel.

I feel cold.

Will they die?

The Hoth System?

Did you call the Zoo?

With food?

Primitive?

Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.

His reactor's starting to overheat.

Cuervo...?

Where is he?

I thought he was, but he came back.

Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.

Shit.

How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?

Top secret. Only on a need to know.

That's the deal.

Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.

So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?

By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?

Not you?

She's in the green.

Plissken...?

Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.

The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?

Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.

How do you know all this?

Me too?

Aw, come on, Snake.

Is that what I think it is?

How do we get out of here?

Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?

The freeway.

I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.

Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.

These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.

Perceval, you have returned!

Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...

Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.

It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.

How? Where?

Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.

I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.

So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.

At your service, sir.

Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?

Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives.

I have come to claim what is mine, Father.

I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.

No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week.

Why can't you be my champion?

I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.

And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?

Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.

It is.

A lovestruck page!

I showed you all my conjuring tricks...

When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.

They do.

Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!

You provoke me, Merlin.

The oath. You didn't say--

Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...

What honey?

You're convinced that it's genuine.

Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.

Here.

Just five or six people.

Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.

This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?

Phonograph.

May I ask...?

Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?

Oh, I see.

Would you like some more coffee?

Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?

Bastard! I will kill you.

Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?

Is it coming out Willie?

Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.

Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.

So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?

Pretty close?

Did he tell you about my party?

You wouldn't.

If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?

Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.

Did Regan know a priest was coming over?

No, is Regan aware of it?

What kind of stuff?

Well, not while we're in Washington.

Hey, where'd this come from?

Who's Captain Howdy?

Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.

Yeah

I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?

Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?

Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?

Oh you did. What did you hear?

Well your thinking's not so good.

People get tired.

Oh my God!

Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.

Goodnight Dims.

Lieutenant?

You just missed them.

Do you like films?

Withering Heights.

I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.

You and Regan?

Quod nomen mihi est?

I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!

Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.

Save your servant

And also with you.

...and the power to confront this cruel demon.

Shut up!!

You're not my mother!!!

You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?

I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.

One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?

Who?

MERRIN!!!!!!!

Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins...

...look down in pity...

Are you comfortable Regan?

How old are you?

What's this?

Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.

So?

Just the same.

Honey ...

Twenty years, Ma ...

Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ...

When they coming in?

Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.

Jack.

It was an accident.

She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.

Seeing anyone in particular?

This time you gotta go.

You gotta go.

I made her nervous.

So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.

What're you talking about?

Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?

The hell you don't.

No?

What was it like?

It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?

I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.

Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.

How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.

Where the hell is she?

I just wish she'd get here, that's all.

Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.

Just a lucky guess.

I thought we had separate rooms.

He's drunk.

I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.

But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.

Why would I mind?

Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.

What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?

You haven't seen Susie, have you?

Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.

The party's over.

April.

I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?

What disease?

What?

Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.

Jack!

Yeah, fine.

Go ahead.

You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.

You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.

You sure?

A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.

You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.

Actually, that's my stage name.

This is show business?

When?

Where's your dress?

Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.

Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.

We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.

Jack, you with us?

I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.

Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.

Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?

Virgins?

And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.

What'd she sing?

Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.

What's with you guys?

Huh?

Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...

Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?

Whatcha doin' over there?

No.

Barker.  Jock Barker?

No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.

All right.  Hold on.

Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?

He do that every year?

It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.

Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.

Relax.  We'll drop the song.

I can keep the beat.

What's that supposed to mean?

You were good.

You were good.

She's four feet tall.  Ed?

History.

My father proposed to my mother in there.

They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.

Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.

Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --

Yeah.

Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.

Oh?

I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.

How'd the show go?

Jack.

Merry Christmas, Jack.

Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?

Do I look wasted -- asshole?

Don't they ever let us take these boots off?

I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?

Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.

Jesus Christ, Castor.

Perfect fit.

And this thing can grow it?

Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?

Who is this?

I took it from my fake husband.

How is he?

How's Loomis?

We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.

Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?

Now what?

How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?

I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.

What are you going to do, Castor?

Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.

Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.

Castor's escaped!

Commander, what are you doing here?

Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?

Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.

We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.

I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?

Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?

-- what?

... That's great.

You're wearing your suit --

I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.

I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.

I'll deal with her later.

You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?

God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...

We did one point seven million in total revenue...

Well, Alan, I think were gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.

Take you, for instance...

...thats our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.

Good for you. Why shouldnt you protect whats yours.

No.

The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.

Do you like kids?

You know how to make chocolate milk?

Big Eds?  Big Eds Tires?  Why...?

Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.

Very nice. What is it?

I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  Its throwin everybody off.  What do you think?

She said that?

Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?

Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...

Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  Youre doing well...

Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise itll be returned!

Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...

Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!

Yeah?  What do you need?

Miss me, Jack?

Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  Youre making a business deal...

As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.

I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.

Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...

Dont  go, Jack...

Look, we dont have time for this right now, well talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  Youre not wearing that to the Thompsons party. I dont care how hilarious you think it is...

Why not?

Yes, Im fine.  Its just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!

Wait a second.  You want me, dont you?

No?

Our life in a nutshell...

You mean this chocolate cake?

You want the cake!?

Thank you...

Cmon, you know what I like to hear...

Then say it...just say it to me...!

Now Im worried...just say it.  Whatever it is well deal with it.

I used to be so sure about everything, you know?  I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...

I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.

Cmon, Jack, you think there arent mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell Im doing in New Jersey...

I mean yes, I help people that need it...

Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...

You know champagne makes me do crazy things.

I dont know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off.

Youre so...beautiful...

Youre talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.

Are you out of your mind?

I'm sorry...

You cant go!

No...

I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...

I need you, tiger..

Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...

Peter Lassiter...

...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...

For one thing, you like expensive things.

For the money, theyre hands down the best radial we carry...

Can I help you?

Damn...damn...damn...

No...Im not...

Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?

It's Christmas Eve, Jack.

Don't you have anywhere to go?

Maybe I can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning...  Okay?

Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?

I found it!

You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.

I don't think She's real big on hate.

How'd you know it was me?

He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --

When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?

Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?

How long was I out?

I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.

You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.

You got a chisel round here?

Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --

It's about to be a broken face.

Ben --

Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.

Where...where am I?

Reed? ... Sue?

What's wrong with me?

The machine works.  And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --

Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?

Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?

We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.

We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.

He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --

Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.

Me like-y.

Stop it.

You two need a time-out.

Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --

What are you doing --

If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.

Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.

You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --

Funny how things turn out, isn't it?

Ben's still out there --

Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?

I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?

It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.

How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?

Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --

And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.

The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --

It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.

Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...

What are you doing?

'Scuse me.

But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!

I know that. But what's the maximum?

Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.

What're you getting at?

-- and why we need you.

I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.

Wish I knew why.

But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?

Right, sir.

Trip? Where to?

Yes, we'd like to get moving.

[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]

I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.

But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?

Air bubbles!... Doctor --

He's making a fine recovery.

A long time, with one man.

Then how come it worked loose?

If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?

Open it! Open it before they get here!

That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.

Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.

Doctor, what's wrong?

Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.

But that isn't possible.

That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.

It's against my better Judgment...

The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.

"Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- "

Sounds like heavy artillery...

All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.

But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.

Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?

Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --

You have no right to blame Duval --

We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.

Looks like somebody declared war.

I don't believe that.

Atomic fuel?

If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?

That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.

I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...

Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?

We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!

Thirty-two minutes left...  But chances are we won't have to wait that long for try-number three.

Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --

Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts --  --from up there?

I'll never find my way through that.

Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.

The Wall's transparent...

Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?

... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service?

Where is Pancakes Hause?

You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.

Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -

Okay.

...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks?  - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -

...Blood has been shed.

That's right. And we need more money.

Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready.

...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -

You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!

Any others?

So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.

I dunno. Just funny-looking.

I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.

No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.

Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.

A subconscious-type thing.

I'm talkin' about your potential.

You're not a C student.

Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.

We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.

So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?

Mr. Lundegaard?

...Mr. Lundegaard?

Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.

but do you know that for sure without -

Yah, but -

Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!

But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -

Yah, well, they exist all right.

Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -

Yah!

Yah!  I... those are in the mail.

...Dad?

...Is everything okay?

Yah, pretty good.

Norstars.

Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -

Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -

How ya doin', Wade?

Yah.

Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -

We're good to loan in.

But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.

- All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!

Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!

Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -

Where is everybody?

Ya see something down there, Chief?

Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.

Yah.

Okay, ya know. Okay.

Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids?

...Now, I know you've had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole -

Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.

Oh. Oh, my.

And this guy is...

Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?

Hon?

Aw, hon, you're better'n them.

Yah, okay. How's the hotel?

Not on your feet too much?

Was it reasonable?

They announced it?

Your mallard?

Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.

I love you, Margie.

This is do-able.

I'm tellin' ya.

That wouldn't interest you.

Get your hands off him!  Get off...! What the hell do you think you're doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a man... !  You killed him!

I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?

I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  We've got some "red-flags" to cover.

I am Jack's Cold Sweat.

No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...

And I saw you practicing this...

Why are you doing this?

I... I don't know.  I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead...

I think testicular cancer should be no contest.

I'll take the parasites.

I want that.

I found a new one.

Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.

Make sure.

I don't know.

That... sawing and hammering.

What is this?  Who did this?

Guy or girl?

What did you say... ?

I'm sorry, I...

Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.

My God, you're shot...

Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.

I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...

It's getting exciting now.

We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.

What?

What list?

Don't I?

... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.

We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?

My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?

"I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in first person.  "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells."  There's a whole series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."

What are you reading?

Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.

You're sure?

Hey... don't knock librarians.

She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.

You want to finish her off?

I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...

This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.

Six months advance pay.  Six months!

Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week.

What are we doing?

Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"

What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?

Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"

I'm not asking you to.

I want to hear the truth.

Why do you think I blew up your condo?

He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!

You have jobs.

Yes...

Fuck you.

Defuse the bomb?

What?

How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...

Why... why... why... ?

What are you doing?

Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?

Look at me...

Excuse me?

It's what he would have wanted, sir.

But, this is Project Mayhem.

But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.

Robert Paulson?

Animals.

Would you rather be dead?

It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too?

What about that?

What did you see?  What am I looking for?

What did you see?

A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.

Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.

Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...

What?

Are you Jorge Cruz?

I got that beat.  So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.

What's going on here?

THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!

I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.

New life defeats death?  Follow the signs?  Where the hell did you find that guy?

Whoa, nine months?

I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile- up.

You can't cheat destiny.  I know what I have to do to save us.  I have to die.

What is it?  What are you?

The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.

When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?

I know this is the first time we've been apart since.  But everything's gonna be okay.

Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...

I mean it.  Take care of it.

You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.

You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight?  I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.

It's only the end of June.

Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.

Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!

He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.

I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?

Can't you open the door?!

Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.

We're losing our favorite teacher.

Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.

Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.

Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.

Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?

His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.

... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.

You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.

Hey, man, why'd you say that?!

So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?

He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.

SHUT UP, BILLY!

You guys are real... aren't you?

What's that?

Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.

Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!

This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.

Again.

You read me, Brewer?

What's this?

Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.

You wanna know why I stood up for this show?

We'll check it out.

It's a guy in a cage.

That guy's not going to make it.

I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.  Her name is Co.

You really got a Masters Degree?

Why's that?

Intelligence work.

It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.

Christ.  How'd you get here?

Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."

Stay on your heading, Captain.

You pathetic scum.

This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.

Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.

He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.

Typical...

How long before you're fully on line?

You think they'll find any?

I know...

Take your time.

Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.

"Terminate with extreme prejudice."

So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?

I hear you're not enjoying it here.

Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.

My parents were divorced.

I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.

I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.

Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.

I'm sorry.

... You have a little... uh... something on your face...

I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.

I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?

Can I have my desk please.

... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!

See, I told you!

Hello....congratulations.

What are you two up to?

So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?

You're kidding!  What did he say?

Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...

You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?

Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!

Well!  What do you want me to do - applaud?

Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?

No...no...we can't...we can't..

Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?

You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.

About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?

You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.

I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?

Which ones?

Your name was picked.

You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.

You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline... 

Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...

Please don't hurt me?

Hi... Where are my shoes?

Do you know what the Little People just told me?

... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know.

The Little...

I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...

I'm not married.

"Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee"....

Do you follow her every day?

What's her name?

Why did you do that?

Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars!

But I gave it to you!

I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.

Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.

Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!

Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.

..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!

Maybe, when we get the Grail...

Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.

OWWW....What are you nuts?!

How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.

Tell me more. I want to know everything.

Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?

No.

Give 'em the horn, Bob.

Well, id'n that nice.

You're not going to play it again.

How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?

Sugar, you know how I feel about you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things, an' what I'm tryin' to do with myself...  You know, there id'n anything in the world I wouldn't do for you, baby. I started livin' the day I found you, you know that?

"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."

I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?

Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.

Rayette.

Just finish eating.

How far are you going to?

We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.

Alaska.

Well...

Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.

Can I get you anything else?

No. We have tomatoes.

You want me to hold the chicken.

Wasn't it, ladies?

We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?

She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.

No, I'm not...  I'm not.

It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...

How long have you been staying here?

He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...

It's not that bad.

Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...

I think he's got a terrific personality.

You were going without saying goodbye?

Bye, now.

I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.

Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?

You don't call that music, though.

Is that funny?

No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...

I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.

I'm not aware of it. Like what?

I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...

That's three games to none, Carl.

What kind of doggy is that?

And what about love?

... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.

Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.

Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.

In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...

I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.

I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.

Don't fuck wit' me! Don't fuck wit' me.  My lawyer's so good he'll have you workin in Alaska, so dress warn.

What?

Wussup?

Yo.

So you got a girl?

A play-ya.

See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.

Who gives!

Eddie from Compost?

Where you goin'?

I think she lives down by Pitt.

A bad attitude.

Yo, that's my girl.

My friend told me she lived around here.

How do I know you're not lying.

Where you know Amanda from?

God I admire you.

Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.

What?

I wasn't asking.

I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.

Creasy, how old are you?

Hey you're really nuts.

I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.

Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?

That's two.

Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.

Right.

Is she ever. I've got some stories....

It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.

Sure, but the end was so sudden.

Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?

So what do you figure?

You find the source?

Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.

Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.

You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.

I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.

Damn... lost again. Sorry.

He is lifting Stanwyk's two attaché cases.

And what was that?

Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?

Has he?

I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.

Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.

Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.

He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.

That's Brazil.

It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...

Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.

I'm still here.

Wouldn't they normally be locked?

That's right.

W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.

Thanks.

Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did ---

Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?

She's cute as a button.

Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.

John who?

Why do you keep doing this?

What's he doing in Utah?

Hi.

I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?

Lunch...

All this goes on Underhill's bill?

Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?

I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.

So?

Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...

No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...

No.

And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.

You can't do that.

I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?

The door was unlocked.

Where is she?

So you're saying she moved out.

Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.

So let's go! We run the pictures.

Who?

How could you call him?

He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.

You'll have it.

Who's Frieda?

Yes?

Mrs. Stanwyk!

Now that we've broken the ice...

My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.

Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.

Did she tell you anything?

That was close...

I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.

You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?

Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.

Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.

You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.

That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...

You going to be okay?

And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.

How'd you get this from her?

Ah, an obvious choice.

I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'

After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part...

Got those Vomit invites here...

Three hundred.

Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...

Suck a dick, I left my purse...

Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?

I can't kill this kid's father...

Are you okay?

Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?

When you going to let me work with you?  Why you always fucking with me?

I got something serious to dis-cuss.

This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.

Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...

So, did you find my dad?

It's me.

Two words.  Disco Express.

'Booty Time.'

Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.

How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.

What about Don?

How's everything?

What?

Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.

Sal --

What's your name, asshole?

I don't know what you're talkin' about.

Twelve o'clock... yes...

Le sommes nous?

I don't know.  Boca is scared. He's not strong enough.  He sees policemen in his soup.

There'll be someone else.

If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.

I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.

Des Moines.

They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.

Why not?

Yeah!

When ya go back on?

Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.

No, you?

Monica?  Who's Monica?

Toy wit' this will ya.

I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.

What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.

We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.

It's Cloudy.  Open the door.

You want the red or the white?

What about Sal?

My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.

Hey, Bo.

Oh, it's been abandoned for years.

So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.

That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some.

Oh, my God!  What is that?!  Why you showing me this shit!?  JESUS!  JESUS! Get those away from me!

How do we get to the vault door?

Damn.

How was your tour?

You give him his drops?

I'm off.

Hey, bud.

I swear, Satch.

Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.

What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.

Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.

You missed a hell of a game, Frank.

Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.

Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.

I'm scared.

You ready?

Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!

Uh, hello?

Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.

What?

...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15.

Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?

You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?

What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?

What's going on?

Oh my god.

It's really you, isn't it?

What?

Why?

She just died, your mother just died?

What are you talking about?

I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.

What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.

You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.

What do I tell them?

Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?

He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.

I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.

He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?

His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.

Dad, what the hell is going on?

Sull!  What the hell!

Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?

Maybe you outta lay off a little...

That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.

Which means he probably knew her.

Okay, lemme walk you through it.

You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.

Are you a good cop, John?

Wife around?

Hell-

Fuck you, asshole.

Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.

Who brought up this bright idea?

What was that?

How about a roll in the hay?

Destroy the evidence?  No, man!

What's this?

No.  I got here just before you did.

Shelly!  Where are you?!

This is too painful to look at.

What do you mean?

I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?

What d'ya got in there?

What are we gonna do?

Is... is everything all right?

See anything?

Got any good ideas?

You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.

If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.

That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.

Whaddya mean?

....with a woman's touch.

Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.

Never should've let her play.

So what are ya drawin'?

There...Ya happy?

Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?

...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?

Okay, okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.

He didn't say anything?

If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.

With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.

Doesn't that tell you something?!

Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?

Look --

Steven buggin' you?

Get up!

Where the fuck is she, Duke?!

Tell me!

Why didn't you tell me?

...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station.

Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.

How many times do you want to hear this?

She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.

My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.

I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.

It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.

He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.

I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.

What murders?

Right.

Right.

And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?

Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?

Jason's here in New York.

What are you doing in here?

I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.

Where did you get that alcohol?

That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.

Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?

I thought I told you to stay away from her.

Did you find Rennie?

I doubt very much that one even exists.

What a beautiful day.

If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...

You had me worried to death!

Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.

You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.

Everything okay?

Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.

I've got the numbers.

I heard you weren't coming.

I don't know...we've gone off course or something...

Rennie...what'd they do to you??

I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.

Crosstown.

We must abandon.

Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.

Very dangerous.

I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.

That's awful.

In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.

What?

What do you mean?

Had to be him.

Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.

What about her?

What?

You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.

We're able to surprise each other.

I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?

I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?

She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'

Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.

Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.

Why won't you tell me your name?

What else?

I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.

I'll have whatever she's having.

There may be things you'd rather not know about.

It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.

What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?

Life is good.

Go way. I'll call a cop.

Where the hell are you?

What do you want?

Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?

I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.

What do you want me to do?

It's the kid's lucky day.

You see what you're doing, don't you?

Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.

Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.

You're a family man, Frankie?

It's a complicated subject.

Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.

You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.

Because life is good.

And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?

Postpone. We have every right.

What do you mean?

Why?

Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.

What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?

Yes.

There was a review.

Endearing.

Would you like to meet him?

Is it true?

But you're his friend.

What? Come on, Paisley.

Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.

Oww!

Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.

God gave you ten thumbs.

"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?

Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?

You'd be Gandhi --  ...I thought you'd be bigger.

That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...

No violence, please.

Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.

I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.

Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?

I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!

I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."

It's beautiful.

Do you find me stubborn?

I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles.

It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.

After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.

Who is that young man?

I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.

In England, I was a poor student but I --

Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.

Perhaps some tea?

Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.

You're an extraordinary man.

And that's the basis of this "Declaration of Independence"?

In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.

Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.

I'm sorry, there's no way we can.

I don't understand why you were dragged out here, Sir.  It's hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this.

According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.

Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?

Don't underestimate these imposters.

He's not here.  It's a blind alley.

Would you care to look--in the telescope?

Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.

Twelve have a mission within the week.

Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.

I don't know exactly, Jerome.

This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?

Let's get out of here.

A day or so.

Up there they wouldn't be a problem.

We can't stay here.

And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?

How was your evening?

Again?

Everybody goes there.

We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.

By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"

Hello?

Vincent...Vincent...

Hugo!  I've found him!

It was a mercy-killing after all.

Where?

It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.

So you didn't do it after all.

Who are they?

I've got enough here.

Flight got you nervous?

The doctor will give you something.

I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.

I'll take care of my end.

You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.

You okay?

Feel good?

It doesn't look like that.

How does it taste?

I guess I'm kind of...

Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.

Why are you laughing?

I didn't. I just waited.

You know how I feel?

Tell me about Beynon's ranch.

Yeah.

Who's she?

He must have.

What do you want to do?

That would be the first time.

Only one car.

I want to say something.

Sounds good.

What is it?

You okay?

Are we going to make it?

What now?

You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?

Hope you get to where you're going.

One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?

All right. Shells?

Chicago.

Yeah. I got out.

Just in case someone gets a shot off.

I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...

Drive.

Let's just get to the border.

You got it.

Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?

I've got to stop.

I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.

Do you want to be dead, Albert?

What did you do?  Albert?

Well, he drove it into the river.

I made a mistake.

A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?

I've been asked to make sure you don't.

Everyhing go off all right?

She's nothing to do with me.

I want to talk to you later.

Though nicer than most?

You know Sid Fletcher?

We went about together.

Yes, while he was here.

A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?

And what was that?

Is he coming here?

Is it one of Kinnear's films?

Who set it up?  Eric?

Did my brother Frank find out?

Now tell me the truth.

We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.

Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.

Have another?

Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?

You coming to South America?

Where you going to live, then?

Where's that?

You work here, Keith?

Heard of a man called Thorpe?

Did they give you a rough time?

All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.

Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?

I won't be using the room tonight.

It's not like that, luv.

You don't look it.

You're a bastard.

So shut up.

No chance of that.

You coming back?

Oh, that's nice.

Meaning what?

Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?

Eh? Have a drink.

Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!

Not going, Jack?

Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.

Ask me?

What's that? A hundred?

Three hundred altogether?

All right. Two hundred.

What's that?

How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.

Polacks and deadbeats.

Deadbeats all.

You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"

You did?

It's too...

You're on this...

And it's not right to the customers.

That's right?

That's right?

...that's right...

Yes.

River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.

That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.

You fucking build it!  Men come...

Should do something to them.

How do you know he'd buy them?

You haven't talked to him.

No.

Because, because, you know, it's a crime.

You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?

...I thought that we were only talking...

Me?

That's ridiculous.

I didn't ask to be.

Why?

Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...

I can't close 'em.

Clear...

I am?

They stole...

He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.

They aren't?

Why don't you think so?

Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?

You have nothing to hide.

They're inured to it.

Will you excuse...

Wh...wh...Wha...?

...how can you talk to me that... that...

I don't know, George, why?

I don't want to go to lunch.

Excuse me, fella.

Who told you...?

Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.

Roma!  I'm talking to you...

Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.

...I only...

Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?

...and I'm going to get bounced and you're...

John.  John...

Why?

I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...

I will close.

Alright.

What are we going to say?

I'm not sure I have two.

Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job.  You know that?  Not too long ago.  For what?  For nothing. "Mur, this new kid burns my ass." "Shelly, he's out." You're gone before I'm back from lunch.  I bought him a trip to Bermuda once...

Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.

How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.

Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...

Mmm.

Yes.  I hear you.

What are you trying to tell me?

Why I don't...

How do you know I made it up?

I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.

What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.

Don't.

You did that?

Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.

...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?

"You do get the..."  Huh?  Huh?

Get the chalk.  Get the chalk...get the chalk!  I closed 'em!  I closed the cocksucker.  Get the chalk and put me on the board.  I'm going to Hawaii!  Put me on the Cadillac board, Williamson!  Pick up the fuckin' chalk.  Eight units. Mountain View...

Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...

The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment.  Period.  The whole eight units.  I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying.  I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility.  But this won't do, and that's not the subject..." Listen to this, I actually said this. "That's not the subject of our evening together." Now I handed them the pen.  I held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "Now I want you to sign."  I sat there.  Five minutes.  Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? "My arm's getting tired?" No.  I did it.  I did it.  Like in the old says, Ricky.  Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it.

You closed 'em today?

And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you.

Glad to meet you.

My wife told me to look into...

Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?

No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.

I'm sorry...?

Rick...?

My wife said I have to cancel the deal.

Three business days.  They mean three business days.

I don't understand.

I told you.

She wants her money back.

You hear what I said?

It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.

Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.

They got, listen to me...

You closed him yesterday.

It went down.  I filed it.

Where are you going?

...you want to go out today...?

We had a slight burglary last night.

Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...

Why do you have to go?

I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it.

They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood.

It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.

We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.

Then why do you come to me?

Goddamn bitch.

Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.

Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?

Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.

Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.

That's what I'm here for.

You?  What do you mean you, I thought...

Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.

The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.

Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!

Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.

The 'patrone' is here.

Within the compound will be fine.

I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...

... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?

If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.

Why didn't someone tell me!

You're going to talk to him now.

Goddamn it, where were you?

They can come in now.

Was it a boy or a girl?

How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?

Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?

They are everywhere!

I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.

Fifteen percent skim?

We've never sent this much with one courier.

The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.

Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.

...and the tape will be running.

No strings.

No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.

And what's the price of their not finding out.

Senator Kane.

Whose orders are these?

How's the baby?

Does it feel like a boy?

I had no idea...

Why don't you sit down?

That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.

When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.

It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?

Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?

Enjoy.

This doubles my investment.

You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.

They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.

Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.

Trust me; do as I ask.

The Corleone family controls two major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the Gaming Commission.  But I have the idea from sources...  ...that you're planning to move in on the Tropicana.  In another week or so you'll move Klingman out, which leaves you with only one technicality.  The license, which is now in Klingman's name.

Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?

What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?

I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.

You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.

I wasn't going to try anything.

You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --

It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.

Something I can do for you?

The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.

No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.

How long you worked for Mr. Whale?

I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?

You ever been married, Hanna?

You did not know?

You must leave.  You were not here this morning.

Good morning.

Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.

These are your paintings?

Yeah?  What were some of your movies?

Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.

I returned recently from a stay in hospital.

You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.

I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.

Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.

All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.

Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.

I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?

Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread.

Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.

I liked it.  We all did.

No.

Did you kill anyone?

So you had a wife?

Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.

What way might that be?

I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?

Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.

Very well put.

I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work.

But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend."  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.

The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?

I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?

Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?

Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.

This was World War I?

Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.

You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?

It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.

If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.

Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?

No.  The girl.

After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?

I never made it to Korea.

You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.

Storm's getting worse.

Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?

No.  It won't do.

I don't know.

Just take off the fucking mask!

You okay?

Need some help?

I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.

I didn't ask George to invite you.

You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.

There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?

I am not forgetting your last brief chat.

Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?

Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.

That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."

Too warm for a sweater, anyway.

Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far.

Just like going swimming, isn't it?

Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.

Mr....Kay?

You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?

What are you doing here?

What about?

A boost. A big boost ...

Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."

You have a Hollandaise sauce ?

My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...

This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?

Get out --

Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...

Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...

They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...

How's that?

It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...

What's wrong with it -- ?

Where you been, anyway?

Yeah.

What's the matter?

Lookit Kip. All grown up...

What about him?

Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...

Most of 'em are late-model...

Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?

We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...

Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.

What does that mean -- ?

You look good...

Why didn't you tell me?

The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...

I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...

I know...

D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?

Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?

Any more, O -- ?

You goin' home?

Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.

It looks just like a regular Mustang --

All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...

You're kind of cultivating a new look.

Hey, you want something to eat ?

Shadow games ...

Dad'd be proud --

You okay -- ?

You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?

You want me to buy her?

Pop the trunk, Tumbler.

Shit ...

You know of one -- ?

Take it back, Freb --

Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --

What's with the look?

On account of Mitch?

What kind of trouble -- ?

That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."

Hey.

Ready -- ?

C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?

I pop your hood; find your siren wires

With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...

You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...

She does have one thing you don't.

I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...

I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...

What happened to Sway?

You know what you got here?

What? What happened?

Don't go busting my balls. Okay?

No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.

I don't want any more of that Shit.

Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.

I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?

You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?

And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.

Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.

Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.

I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.

Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.

Stop! Stop!

Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.

Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.

What are you talking about?

They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.

Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.

We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?

Don't worry about it.

I want to talk to Jimmy.

Do you realize what we're involved in here now?

Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.

I hate to do dishes.

How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?

The third store down.

He didn't call?

If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.

We'll pack up everything and send it to you.

You want a partner?

No way! You're kiddin'!

Who's she talking to?

Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--

Thanks, Chuck.

Why didn't you yoke him?

How'd you know where to find me?

Oh, right.

Is this a bad time?

I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.

Is that true?

What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.

Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.

My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.

Did your Uncle get arrested?

It's a good thing no one's Irish here.

What'd you say about me?

Will you take a check?

What class did you say that was?

How'd you like that course?

Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.

To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.

Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?

--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--

Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--

Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.

--That edge!

This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--

Thank you.

This job... Do it if it's what you really want.

Yes.

I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.

Good to meet you.

How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?

You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?

I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.

--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--

He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--

He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.

Oh, come on, Sean--

--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.

You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!

Hello, Sean.

Sean...

Where're you going?

Do you know when you'll be back?

Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?

Who is he?

That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.

Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker.

No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.

I go places, I interact.

Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.

Who is "Danny Terrio?"

Well, I can see this is pointless...

Crayons?

No.

Why thank you.

You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says "man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee." So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee!"

How'd it go?

Well, are you going out again?

Why not?

Why not?

Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?

You don't regret meetin' your wife?

Where were you?

I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."

Would have been nice to catch that game though.

Do you think you're alone?

Don't give me you line of shit.

Oh, I know.

No. Thank you.

Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.

Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.

Sounds good, where are you now?

Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.

Have you ever seen Annie Hall?

You have a lot of brothers and sisters?

How many?

Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.

Where have you been?

You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?

Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?

You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.

I thought you said you'd show me your place.

Just for fun?

I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.

Will? Are you awake?

I know. I just do.

I don't know. I just feel it.

Why not?

Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?

Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.

Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.

Ready, Ma?

Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.

No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.

Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?

Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!

That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*

What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?

Lots must a died, too.

Maybe the road's out.

Any gas?

Short fella. Pale face.

Women?

Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.

I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?

Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that.

That's the way it is.

We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.

*You* find out, I can't.

But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.

Been out travelin' around?

Excuse me for asking.

And you ain't ashamed?

This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?

Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.

He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?

Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?

Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids...  So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?

I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.

Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches.

I didn't mean nothing.

Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.

Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.

But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.

Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.

*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...

Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?

Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.

You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!

No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.

No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.

And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...

Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.

Look, Ma!

Didn' you get no sleep?

She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?

You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.

Sure. Good-by.

Yeah?

Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for a penny.

They gone.

Well?

Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!

Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.

How you get all this money?

She's jus' wore out, that's all.

You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back.

Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!

I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!

Please don't.

Can you pick peaches?

Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.

You don't...

You're so funny...

Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.

Remember high school?

Jesus...

I just play my own collection.

That's it?

What's your business?

Are you going to the reunion?

It's always the little things.

I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.

Flowers. That's funny.

...Let me get my coat.

Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--

Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...

Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.

Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.

Will you come with me?

You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.

Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?

We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.

You needn't be so frank with me about your work.

You know where I live?

...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.

How was your day, today, sir?

Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.

But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.

That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.

And not show it to me. Ever again.

They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.

Don't forget your identity.

Marty! It's me. Paul.

God it's great to see you.

No. You drove us here.

How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?

So when are you authorized to use deadly force?

So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.

Why not?

I'm a professional killer.

I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --

I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.

What?

That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.

Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.

You lived in Chicago?

I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?

Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?

Yeah.

I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...

Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.

Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...

Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?

Dad'll pick you up today, all right?

Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...

You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.

Yeah?

What?

No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --

Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.

This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.

Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?

That's not true!

He's still sitting in that damn field.

Did you ask him to come visit?

Did he mention it?

Does anybody out there want something to drink?

Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --

Grace, I don't hate your father.

Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.

Started what?

Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.

How's everything?

David?

What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?

Uh, yes... Sure, David.

I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.

Okay. We'll see you later then.

What about Grace?

That bag's almost empty.

I should go get some of her things.

You've got to stop doing that?

How was the dinner?

Did you get a hold of that horse guy?

I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...

You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --

No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea

I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.

And you think it's best if I don't come.

Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?

Oh well... branding will do that to you.

Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.

I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...

You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking...

Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?

No. I am a "tubab."

Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...

What choice!!?

Thank you. You're all doing too much.

I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?

You and Frank ever take a vacation?

Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...

Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.

Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.

I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once.

Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?

Tom?

We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.

Of course I have.

Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.

Sure?

It's warmer than I thought.

I thought your mom's coming up?

Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?

Honey, you all right? Did something fall?

You shut up, stupid!

Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.

Is the poverty worse, now, you think?

Long enough.

Cool?

How's it going, Ray?

That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.

Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.

So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?

Ta-da!

Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.

Yeah?

You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?

Dead.

What are you doing?

Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?

I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?

Crash Override.

Yo, showtime, showtime!

Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!

Two days.

That's a nice score for a girl.

I'm Crash Override.

What the hell are you doing?

This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.

There they are!

A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.

It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.

Dade.

Gill.

Hello?

Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.

Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?

You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?

Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.

Phreak?

What the hell was that all about?

Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...

You said the worm was untreaceable!

Send a Flu-shot.

Purpose of visit?

So?

It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.

Can't you find somebody else?

Because the lights are all out.

Night Doc.

We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.

Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?

Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster.

Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.

Jamie, sometimes it's...

Sure it does.

It's been eleven months.

Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.

I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.

Come on Rachel!

Jamie, wait for me.

Jamie!

What are you doing out here alone?

Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.

Why don't you go make some coffee.

Hi Rachel.

You won't come on too strong.

Making sure that no one can get in here.

I am. Ben Meeker.

That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.

Why?

It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.

Where's that Deputy?

How's it powered?

Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.

Jamie! Get away!

Why didn't you wait for me?

Sure.

Shit!

It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.

Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.

Hello?

Annie, was that you?

I thought it was an obscene phone call.

Sure, see you later.

You still spooked?

I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.

Yes.

I wonder where they went.

I gotta go.

Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.

I'd like to talk to you, if I could.

A man wouldn't do that...

You have the wrong feeling.

It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!

Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.

Can we watch the monster movies?

..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."

Laurie...

I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.

Laurie, you come with us...

Yes, she is.

PROBABLY going.

Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.

The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.

Ever done anything like this before?

I don't think this is any time to be funny...

I love that.  That's my type.

We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.

Wha--  What kind of things do you build?

That's just --

Yeah.

Oh!

It's French, though.  It really is.

Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.

I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.

We got that idea on that trip to Paris.

Hmm?

Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.

Is this your first job?

Oh, what, what do you do?

Yeah.

It's really sad.

Yeah.

Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.

Now I ca-can't remember.

I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.

I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.

Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.

Like, uh...?

Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.

How about you?

Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.

I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful.

Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.

No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...

Uh, yes!

I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.

Well, thanks a lot.

Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.

I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.

He's got like six gold records.

Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.

Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?

Elliot!  Don't!

Elliot!

O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.

Your guilt is because you feel the same.

They're fantastic.

God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?

It's so late.

Are you in a bad mood?

Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?

No!

Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?

Don't make it worse, Dad.

Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?

How do you know?

How about something to eat?

Me?

Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.

Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?

What are you going to use for money?!

Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!

You've been with someone!

Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.

Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.

In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?

You're just realizing this now?

Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?

Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.

...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.

What do--?  You're being ridiculous.

Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.

I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.

Ohh!

Go right over there.

I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--

Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--

Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.

What?  You're kidding!

You admit that we're great cooks, right?

Ohh?

Not this Thanksgiving, you know.

You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.

I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.

Ohh!

Boy, you really know how to cut me down.

Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.

Oh, gosh.

Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.

Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.

I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--

That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.

Can we, can we go?

Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?

...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...

Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.

Well...

Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?

No, I am.  I am.

I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...

Well, what about me?

Oh, God!

It's all right.

So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...

Tch.

Dad...

You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?

Uh-huh.

And?

You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...

You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?

And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.

Well.  Word gets around.

What have they got you doing?

...you...

I'm looking for...

Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?

We could skip the Gavotte.

Who would that be.

C'mon, pal.

How crazy is that.

I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...

...he was <u>wealthy</u>...

What else did I miss...?

The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.

HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.

...sir...?

He escaped...

...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...

You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...

...here's to child abuse!

I don't mind being the token <u>woman</u>, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token <u>man</u>... who are these Warriors, ¥our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm in the room with a fugitive felon...

I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...

She threw a punch at a man on the team.

What, you're saying she was overwrought.

....I didn't realize I said it out loud.

Waited too long, hon...?  

Waal...

Give it up, Evelda.

Give it up.

My husband brought it to me from America.

If your duty requires it.

Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?

How could you know?

Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.

Yes.... yes...

Make them eat the figurine.

Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...

I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...

Why should <u>you</u> care?

You want another drink, honey...?

You should get Married.

Because you're going to help me plan a party.

What was it.  What was it, honey?

No.

Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.

Give me your gun...

...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...

...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?

I know where he is.

I want the money.

You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.

But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.

Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...

...what a lovely perfume.

...this one is my favorite.  It has not title.  They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?

<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?

Speaking of the Vacant Post.

...a <u>liaison</u> position...

...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...

...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...

Yes.

But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"-- 

You said:  that you have "decided." That your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside.  And get on with your job.

And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...

But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.

Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.

It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.

But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.

I'm gay. Like you didn't know.

Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.

Howdy Pouty.

She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club.  Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...

There you are!  Man, I don't know how to thank...

Man, she's losing it...

Freeze!  You're busted!

Mine!

No, they're not from Wendy.

I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.

Hello?!  What's in it for me?

I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.

Hey.

So this is it, anybody you don't agree about everything with can't be your friend...

Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...

Iunno.  Of course I believe you. It's so you...I didn't think it was possible                        ] for you to make me feel worse,                              ] but...you're saying you <u>deliberately</u>                        ] destroyed us!

Next to "boring," "Sucks" is the most painfully overused word in the current English language. I thought if I could reverse the meaning of "sucks" so it means something positive, I don't know...It would be vaguely revolutionary. It's kind of my social experiment for the summer. "Suck" is historically a nice word-- sno-cones, your mother's...

I don't believe it. I'm winning.

I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.

So, are you a cheerleader?

I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice....

Oh, I have to hear this.

Things are going to change, Earl.

Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......

I was talking with someone!

Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.

You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.

That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.

You stupid cunt!

Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.

Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.

I said I was sorry.

What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.

Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!

God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.

What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?

Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.

You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?

It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.

And your worst enemy.

Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.

What is this shit?

This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.

Can't you see this is a special moment?

You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.

Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for...

I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....

Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...

This knife is filthy.

Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.

The bomb, asshole!

Any contestants worth mentioning?

Turn that back on!

Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!

I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.

I adore anything to do with the arts.

Come on! Sausage rolls.

and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.

What now?

I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.

He's the manager!

I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.

Come on, sit up.

holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.

What does old Stew want?

You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.

I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!

It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.

That's coming along well!

is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.

But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!

I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!

I think I'm going crazy.

Let's go overseas . . .

Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .

This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!

That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.

I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.

Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.

Sure plenty of times.

No.

No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over

I understand... I won't-

Must be nice.

I have my connections

Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.

Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.

Have we met?

Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.

Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.

As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?

Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.

Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.

Never to put you in my will.

But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet

Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.

Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?

Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.

You mean... when the car went off the bridge?

I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...

Dreams?

My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.

It's not that kind of date.

Tawny? What's- what are you doing?

Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?

You should give it to someone with only one leg.

You should go in.  You're risking your life again...

And she thinks you're blackmailing me?

Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John.

You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.

"Anticipation of incarceration"?

He gives a good report and I walk?

Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.

Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...

That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!

Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.

Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...

What is it, five days now I don't see you!

You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?

I didn't even know you had a kid.

Bernie, how'sa kid?

Nothin'.

He waited for you three hours!

Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...

For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.

My fault!  My fault!  This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault?

What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?

"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...

Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...

-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?

Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?

Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?

Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?

I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.

"A little mistake"!

Did you get it?  Jesus, did I say that?

This guy LaPlante won an award?

He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?

There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...

Helluva story!

It's not unthinkable.

I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..

Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --

I didn't ask him.

Excuse me, Ms. Gayley.  That guy Inspector Dayton... he's recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants...

Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...

How's the new place?

Oh, great.

What happened?

I found a cent!

'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '

A man?  Was it a dream?

Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.

Thank God.

Honey --

But it's what we want.

They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.

How were we -- were we cool?

<u>Now</u>, Neil.  Stop teasing your sister.

Did you hear what he said?

-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.

His secretary just confirmed.

I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes.  When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled.  I had cancelled!  Then I get back to my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>.

Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?

I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --

Should I come home when I'm finished there?

Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.

Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!

Okay!  We have TV!  We can all get stupid again!

Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.

That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.

Promise?

Really?

Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?

Lieutenant?

This ties in with Nash.

I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.

What?

Tell me again.  Where'd you go?

No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.

The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.

The river.

England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.

I'll go first.

I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.

Agreed.

How comes it your are not afraid?

I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.

We had a bargain.  You promised.

Aye?

Huge.

You guys are from the British museum, right?

Why do I feel that you know what's going on?

Where did you get it?

What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?

You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.

Why do you stare at me like that?

You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.

No.

Why?

You didn't answer my question.

Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?

Would you like to see it?

He's in there!

We're holding the workers down below.

We found him this morning.

Jennifer, there is more to life than work.

It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.

Don't leave us, Conner.

What are you doing?

I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--

Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.

Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.

You get anything on Smith?

Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?

Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.

You should warn them, Sonny.

Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.

Who sent you?

The car.  All you want is the car?

C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.

We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.

Then we might as well die rich.

Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.

Talley?

I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.

We been through that.  Forget it.

Who else is here?

He needs a doctor.

My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.

We can take it with us.

Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.

Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?

Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.

L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.

Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?

You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.

I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.

I need to work out some stuff.

Want one?

Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.

Now we can do whatever we want.

You gotta pee?

Thanks for the shirt.

What do you want?

What happened?

I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.

Where are they?

Is something wrong with Jane?

He didn't say.

I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.

Louise?

Chief, base.

She didn't answer.

Did you find Jane and Mandy?

Do it.

If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.

They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.

No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.

You want me to stick around, I could --

Let it go, Captain.

What's my name?

Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!

Is my daddy okay?

Can you open them?

I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.

Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --

Who are you?

Marlon and Al....

<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!

Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.

What is this about?

You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.

I used to work at the Diplomat.

They are all Tutsi cockroaches.

Please, I don't use guns.

Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.

Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?

We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?

If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?

What was the response?

Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver

They fired a rocket at us.

Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.

The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us. What do you think would have happened? No different.

Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.

General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.

We must go to the Diplomat.

The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.

Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?

Are you sure this is the river road?

Paul, how the hell are ya'?

Don't lie to me. What's your name?

Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.

No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.

This time the Militia will kill us.

Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?

Thomas wants advice?

Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.

Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.

Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.

Please, Paul, 'til first light.

Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.

Go to the roof now.

I had you transferred to Kigali.

What does it matter.

A Volkswagen.

Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.

The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.

Can I have your name again?

Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.

Rutaganda's place?

What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?

Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.

What are you doing?

How much beer?

I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?

All. What do you mean all?

The French. They supply the Rwandan army.

Why the hurry, Roger?

I don't know.

Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.

-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."

Not yet.

If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?

More of Price's spook-house bullshit.

Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.

Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?

What?

Excuse me?

I'm sorry --

Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.

You're totally full of shit, aren't you?

You said that was an accident.

-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --

What's in there?

-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!

What's down there?

Oh. Jesus.

This is nuts.

-- the stained glass --

Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air!

-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --

-- you lose either way, Price --

Good point.

Cheery looking bunch.

Or an on-line computer.

It's okay, everything's okay now.

What?

-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.

So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?

Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?

Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.

First time for everything.

I think...I may have the answer.

Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.

Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --

But the million bucks each, that's for real?

Wish I could take the credit, but --

Won't do any good.

No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.

You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?

For the love of God....please...?

So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?

We don't have proof of that.

Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.

Did you find her?!

Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?

What about all my other stuff?

H-how long will it take?

She says she's lonely...

What's he doing daddy?

Look daddy!  It's empty!

We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...

Good night Angel...

Mommy!

Oh come on...

To our family.

...set up some more things.

What is it?

But do you agree with me?

Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...

Who?

Oh come on!

Whoa there...

Maura!

You've done your homework, Mrs. South.

You must be a Londrigan.

I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.

Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.

She's coming back.  Keep talking!

My name is Father Seamus.  I'm from Holy Rood church.

I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.

I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.

Keep talking!

The rain is letting up.

Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.

Where did you find this?

There's something in there.

What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.

You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.

The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.

Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.

Wha .... ?

Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.

Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?

Why are you so interested?

The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22

How have you ... ?

... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ...

I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.

Joey ... ?

It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.

Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.

Welcome. 38

Uh-huh.

You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...

Do you mind me talking about your stuff?

It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.

What ... What ... ?

A dark star rising.  I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed.  A friend relieved me of that inconvenience.  Now I'm free.  Born again of Blood and Desire.

You see, we're not so dissimilar.

Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.

Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...

A girl?  Anyone I should know?

Yeah right.  Look ...

Oh thank God, you're dead...

The security's actually not that severe.

That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything?

Hmmmm.....

Alex!

Cameras?

"And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo."

"You could be swinging on a star."

No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?

Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"

"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"

That was close....

Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.

Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.

My life is not some deal.  I...

Don't you just hate kids...

With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?

Hit me with your best shot.

Anna, what are you trying to say...

I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."

Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--

As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.

Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.

And I'll bring my entourage...

tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.

The C.I. what?  God, no...

I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...

You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.

Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.

I hope you know what....

Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?

Way to go, Anna.

Cat got his tongue?

What's your favorite sport, Hawk?

What a pleasant surprise.  You're probably wondering...

Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...

Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.

All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.

Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?

If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....

This is the worst night...

Don't I know you...

I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."

Thanks for sharing.

I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!

...Hello?

A sawbuck!

I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...

What a horrible little person.

Cigarette?

You're from Muncie?!

-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!

...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?

Is that all, Mr. Barnes?

I'm sure I --

Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.

Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.

Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --

I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.

...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?

They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --

Now, Amy --

...You son of a --

I filed it yesterday.

You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?

What the heck's she doin', Lou?

...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.

Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?

My pleasure, sir.

This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!

Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!

Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --

Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.

Sir?

'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '

'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --'

...Yeah, go ahead.

But look, I'm president of the company now and I --

Tell him I'll be right there...  Well, what is it?

...Enter the dame.

She finds him.

...He's not noticing, Benny.

He don't look wise.

Good morning, miss.

Things so bad, nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell.

If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.

I'd love to.

Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.

Mrs. Rand.

She can never be cured?

I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.

I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.

You're single?

They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.

That will mean another interview, won't it?

No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.

Where do you think you're going?

But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?

But don't you have to work?

That doesn't sound like him.

Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?

No, Wes.

It is not beautiful.

Can't I take it for you?

I heard someone crying -- a woman --

And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?

A mental case?

I suppose so.  Yes.

I've never given it much thought.

You don't seem very disturbed by it.  I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened.

I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.

Well?

I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, "Paul, darling..."  The whole thing beginning all over again...

I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.

You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.

I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.

You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.

I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.

You wanted to warn me...

Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.

In other words, I'm on trial.

Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.

And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?

Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!

Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...

The Halfords have invited us again this year.

What do you think?

I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.

Don't be dim.

I'm not surprised.

Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.

It's a starting place.

Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.

This just isn't the best moment for this.

Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.

Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --

Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up.

It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --

Huh?

How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --

What the hell are you kids doing down here?

He's probably been waiting all night at the station.

What?

Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions.

It's what?

Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?

Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.

Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--

They need the money for my band uniform at school.

I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.

Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.

Please don't.

How'd you know?

Here you are.

Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.

It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers --

Forget what?

-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.

You ask what the point is?

If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --

You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.

Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?

How can you do that man?

What?

Frankie opens them with his teeth.

It's beyond mere physical attraction.

How do you know this shit?

Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?

Want some gum?

Is this Charles?

Right.

Hey Wendy.

Well, you can...

All my model planes.

They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.

Yeah.

It feels warm.

Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?

Good.

I have to get back.

My partner...

Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.

Do it again.

Who's that?

I could say the same thing about you.

Oh, I shouldn't have...

It's legitimate.

What about your shoulder?

Thanks.

What are you doing here?

Eight years.

They're all over everybody.

No way.

You don't have to be involved, Will.

What if someone finds out?

I don't know what you're fucking talking about.

I told you I don't remember.

I never met anyone from Seattle before.

Thought you might find that.

What about him?

Randy Stetz is in jail.

Yes.  Like that.

Your lips, they didn't move.

My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.

No, my beloved, my child.

Are these not the answers you came for?

You didn't even warm them, did you?

Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?

What plans?

Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?

Laudanum!

But you never let me see you kill, Louis.

Claudia! You did that?

We're immortal. You've always known that.

You... fed on me?

But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.

He's dead, Claudia, dead.

Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?

In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.

The ship is sailing wihout us!

A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?

Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.

But this can't be real. This is nonsense.

I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!

Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...

She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.

Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now even.

Diane!!!!

You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.

What have I done?

Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.

You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.

What do you imagine you are Louis?

Why do you do this Lestat?

I didn't want to kill her.

Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.

It's only a siren...

So you want me to tell you the story of my life...

You followed me here, didn't you?

You loved your wife, surely.

Lestat escaped the fire!

But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?

You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!

And the child who did die?

Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?

What can I do for you?

Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.

Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.

Sorry. Emergencies only.

Listen to me. He's here.

Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.

I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.

Say yes.

He does work hard.

I'm the King of the World.

Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.

No way.

Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?

I know I don't want to stay in here.

Be careful, Julie.

I'm holding your hand!

Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.

Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.

We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...

Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.

Never do that again.

Checking the locks again?

We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.

I'm sorry.

It was one year ago...

I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.

This was not my idea.

And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.

You sure it's okay with you?

Oh, Will! I'm sorry.

What? What are you talking about? Where?

There was a body! I swear it!

Come on. We're gonna be okay.

Oooh, the mainland --

Guess the capital of Brazil --

Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.

Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.

Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?

He leave you?

You stumbled into my hiding place.

The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.

Where is Miss Wollsten?

If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.

We will see who is the first to die.

) You feel the symptoms?

I'm not sure that it is the plague.

Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.

You're not leaving tomorrow..?

Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?

It's getting dark. I can't leave now.

Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.

I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -or just because he is one's father?

I felt he did not like me.

Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?

You will not say one single word. I know your secret.

I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure - quite sure.

I don't really know where Thea comes from. The ViceConsul at Adrianople brought her to me..

Theodosia.

You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?

This girl --

She is not there. The coffin is gone.

I had a notion you had become selfappointed chaperone lately  why?

I have had command for the last time -

Theodosia --

Thea, what's wrong?

I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter.

Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.

Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family  no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.

Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.

Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.

Get that ladder up here.

Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.

All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.

Good morning, sir.

We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.

Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.

Oh, no.

That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.

I told you  I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.

It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .

Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?

Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?

If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?

Why, yes. This is amazing.

Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.

You sent for me, sir?

The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

What's that?

Is this the place?

There it is, good as new.

I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.

Hee-haw!

We just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then we're going to drive on down to Florida.

She's swell.

Hmmmm . . .

Sure  Sam Wainwright.

Well then, how do you know?

George! George!

You're not paid to be a canary.

Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?

Is it a charge, sir?

Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.

Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?

We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.

She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.

Hello, Georgie-Porgie.

What gives?

No, George, don't . . .

Say hello to New York for me.

Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy. Now, look  if you'll point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? George?

Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .

Holy mackerel!

And did you put the envelope in your pocket?

Just a minute  just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . Why, in the twenty-five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why . . . Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You . . . you said . . . What'd you say just a minute ago? . . . They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!

Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.

Made up your mind yet?

With coconuts?

I'm not very good at this.

Eighteen.

Your . . . your caboose, my lady.

I'll take it. And then what?

They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.

Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.

How's that?

It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.

All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.

What is it, a sore throat or what?

Mary! Mary!

Oh, George, George, George.

Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.

Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.

Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.

How fast does this go?

You can?

For me...?

Wheee!  Faster!

Why not?

Your dad must be really pissed.

They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.

As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in.  My dad's the mayor....

Coming up!

We're hung up here.  Snagged.

It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---

Good morning!

On your own time?

Chief....

I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.

Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.

See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.

What else is there to do?

Do I have to?

Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  We've had a lot of trouble.

Is Hooper coming to dinner?

Dad, I'm sorry....

Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....

Fantastic lady.  Don't know what I'd do without her.

Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.

Do you?

This is a mammal, not a fish.

Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.

Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.

Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?

Let's get the kid home.

Eat Cheerios.

One what?  Ah-ha!

Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.

That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?

Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.

No.

The goddamn smell is always the same. 

What's wrong?

What?

That you were fired.

Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!

I know you did....

A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.

Yeah?  Then what?

Did you say Cable Junction?

Some people.

My cousin will be here tomorrow.

You're not going out right away, are you?

Tina Wilcox.

You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?

But first, a little juice....

All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.

Hurry, please.

What is it?

I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.

I don't care.

Heading back?

I don't think she's such hot stuff.

You're going out.

I want to go with you!

Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.

You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!

Be reasonable, please....

Go on, Doctor.

He's going with you, Doctor.

I'll need more men to look.

What's your plan, Brody?

Aren't you suiting up, mate?

Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.

Well, not much longer to go.

Yeah.

Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?

Not enough loving.

That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.

Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.

How the hell did it get in here?

After what happened to us?

Here.

Change your mind?

Finally.

Recovering nicely.

Mmmm... you smell good.

I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?

I did.  He wants it on exhibit.

Honey, what is it?

Yes, you can.

Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --

What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.

Come on!

... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.

I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.

Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.

Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.

I can have them walk backwards.

I told you, something's upset them.

You can get killed!

Why?

I like it when they wake up.

That's because I am the shark.

Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.

I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...

Musclehead?

Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?

How long you staying?

I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.

Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.

No...  It can't be.

The space shuttle has landed!

Ahhh, ahhh...

Gotta sneeze.

Did you see that?

Yeah, well I didn't!

You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.

South Georgia, Antarctica.

I'll go with you.

How'd you do in school?

Yeah, he'll really go for that.

Where are you going?

What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....

I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....

Turn it off....

Where have you been...?

You knew...?

Where's my mother?

Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?

All he did was kiss me....

Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....

We will...We'll have a lot of time together.  What are you going to do now?

Sweet breezes...Sweet women....

I see what you're doing....

Are you all right?

You're coming, aren't you...?

I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.

Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....

I'll be all right, Michael.

It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....

That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....

You look tired....

I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....

It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.

It got him....

Promise me you'll be all right....

No....

Flies the plane....

I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.

Depends on where you want to go....

You're not going to tell me, are you?

The kind with an umbrella in it....

A drink with an umbrella in it....

I'll nick the boss' plane again....

Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....

There's nothing to be sorry about.

I tried to tell you...I tried....

Want to go for a little ride?

I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'

Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?

It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....

Grab your socks....

Can't this thing go any faster?

What happened?

Yeah....

She has good days and bad...I don't know....

I wish there was something I could do....

Let me speak to Ellen....

Stop farting around....

Maybe it's the tags that suck....

I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....

Maybe I missed you too....

What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?

When I invited you...

I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.

How long have you known Hoagie?

How long?

What's so funny about that?

Half don't...Bring her about....

I'm coming...How close is it?

What about Carla's gig?

Stop that!

You told me what?

What the hell are you doing?

All the time....

Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.

I'll do it, Jake.

Jake.

Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....

She's in management....

Woman has taste....

Did you like that, Mama?

I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?

Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?

Did you bring it with you?

I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..

What do you think?

We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?

Who is who?

How's the new residence?

What do you mean?

Because I dislike her too much ..

That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.

God, it pisses me off, Ross.

Stop it.

I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.

Well .. I didn't know that ..

What about Citrine?

You got a quiet phone somewhere?

Jesus. What are you doin?

What exactly you doing, John?

How do you know her hair's black?

Have you got a print from the hand?

Is this normal?

Did he get you the job?

.. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..

His blind friend got "attacked." Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper.

He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..

Yes, Sir.

D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?

Sorry?

I know what you're like ..

You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?

She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight.

The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..

You do?

Why?

Interview over, Blattis ...

What was she like?

I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.

He's happy, darlin ..

Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.

Shut up, King Jay ..

On the infill. The guy from L.A.'s just gone down there ..

Where do you fit in, Trimble?

I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?

I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir

Don't ever stop fucking me!

You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!

Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.

Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.

It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --

Didn't hear it.

Oh Jerry.

Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.

Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.

... this is... uh... too funny...

Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.

Wonder what he said.

But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.

It's all going to work.

It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.

Oh my God.

Too bad.

Beer okay?

Truth?

Yeah, I did.

No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.

Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.

I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --

I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.

You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.

Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?

Another time, okay Dorothy?

And I really don't know your noises yet.

It's my fault.

Why fucking not!  I deserve it.

You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.

He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.

This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.

I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?

No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.

I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.

Denver is where he should be.

What happened to Denver?

--  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?

At last I find you.

You're loving me now, aren't ya?

See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!

--  the kwan.

Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.

No, I air-dry.

Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.

I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.

You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?

I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.

You never had The Talk, did you?

Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.

For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.

I think so.

Jerry!  You made it --

Oh, tell the story.

Gorgeous.

I'm sorry what I said back there.

Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.

Cronin's okay for lunch?

Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...

SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...

What's going on, Jerry?

-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...

ERRR-IIIC!

Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...

...once-in-a-lifetime.

Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!

He says it's a bad idea!

Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.

No, Dr. Grant says...

Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?

I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...

What?...WHAT!?

You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.

He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.

I dont know.

He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?

How was your trip? Profitable?

Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.

That does sound lucky.

How would you classify it?

Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.

It looks intact.

Good luck with the fund raising.

Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.

When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.

Did you read Malcolm's book?

Know what this is?

We need to head for the coast.

What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?

What the hell is going on? What are they doing?

I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.

You think I'm all talk, Eddie?

Resentful.

What?

I don't believe you.

No, no, no, no, no, no . . .

And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.

Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --

Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.

I could come with you.

Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?

Where's the power and radio setup?

We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.

She's gutty.

No way.

Then this is our chance.

So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!

Lava?

I think she's with Sarah!

Something's wrong.

No.  I'm quite certain you can't.

Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.

Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.

You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."

No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.

No!  We're an independently funded expedition.

Oh, God.

These formations.  They're dried --

He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.

That little black line?

Hold it down, Nick!

There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:

WHAT ARE YOU-

Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -

I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.

Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.

Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?

- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?

Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?

Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.

Fascinating animals, fascinating.

Carousel.

But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.

Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -

You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.

Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.

And what are those?

Why would they care what we think?

The movement!

You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -

Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?

- - and swallows fresh ones.

Dr. Grant!

Oh my God.  Aw, God.

C'mon on, this way.

And scary.

Uh - - thumb!  The same way.

Alan, listen to this.

Oh, imperfections?

Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.

What's this I hear at the airport Hammond's not even here?

John, we - - what I'm just saying....

Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?

It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?

You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --

Straight-A brainiac!

Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.

It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?

By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -

I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.

Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?

Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!

I could compensate you by fully funding your dig

That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?

- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.

Ah - - they're here.

Watch how it eats!

It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?

Your silence intrigues me.

I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.

Why didn't I build in Orlando?

Well?

I hate trees!

That's not true...

I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."

That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...

Sorry.

You watch this garbage?

Oh?

Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.

Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.

How do we prove it?

I think I'm onto something, Joe.

Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.

Uh-huh...

See this?

Add it to the list.

It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.

Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.

What happened? Where's Jason?

-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.

You work in the insurance department?

Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?

-- Merely in the interests of order.

-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?

Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake.

I read the one about the penal colony.

-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.

I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.

I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.

Will you do me a favor then?

You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.

When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.

Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?

Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.

I'm sorry, but I just wondered --

How long were you and Eduard --

The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?

When I have no reason to doubt.

Ah -- we're back to the "authorities" you spoke of.

I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.

I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.

Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.

You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.

Burgel doesn't like anybody!

And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?

Gabriela! -- you did get away.

I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.

He was found in the River.  Could he swim?

I'll bear that in mind.

You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.

... A piece of paper ...

And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.

The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.

I'm overworked as it is.  "Raban" did you say?

If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?

Where do our records go to in the Castle?

Ludwig.

He can't sit still.  Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.

We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.

I understand he was wounded in the lung.

Then that's the place for us!

I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.

Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -

No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!

God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!

I'm sorry ...

Where do I charter a boat?

There's no island there. We're wasting our time!

I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.

They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.

Man Eater!!!

Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!

Enjoy.  Well --

Well I have to close up now.

Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.

Can't we talk together reasonably, just -- ordinarily?  I know you're expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior, but believe me -- do you believe me? --

No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?

Excuse me Miss Daniel?

Oh no, I don't think --

You said that.

Why?

You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?

Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.

Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?

Didn't he tell you what you wanted?

I thought you were going back to the apartment.

Is there anything more I could --

What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?

You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.

Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?

You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.

The same as Jane McKenna.

The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.

No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --

No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.

Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.

Is that all you have to say?

Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.

Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something.

Please. I said I don't want you to do this.

I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.

Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!

Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me?

All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?

Where, how?

I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.

I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?

You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?

It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --

That who?

You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.

What?

I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man?

It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.

I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.

OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.

-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?

No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.

No.

He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.

That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.

But what reason could he have? What possible reason?

The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands.

No.  But I've been to Brooklyn.

What do you like best about your daddy?

He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory.

On earth.

Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?

I'm sorry.

I think I'm going to throw up.

There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.

Owwww...You're hurting me... You're hurting me...I hate you ...I hate you...

I'm sorry...

Daddy?

Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...

Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...

Wow!

Are you going to get remarried?

No, son.  Daddy and mommy will never get remarried.

Mom--I mean, dad?

Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"

Was there apple juice when you were little?

Was there Burger King?

Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.

What don't you understand, pal?

Objection!

Sustained.

Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?

And would you describe those years as happy?

Did you wish to?

Objection.

Objection!

Objection, your honor!  Counsel is harassing the witness.

Objection!  Your honor, counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings.

Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?

Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?

Somewhere in between.

Were you?

No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.

Where are you going?

Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.

Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.

Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--

Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--

He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...

Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?

Hey, what's the rush?  C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.

Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.

Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--

And?

How should I know?

So...what's so terrible about that?

But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.

Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.

And?

It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...

I lost him?  I lost him?

Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life.

What?!  She wants what?!

You ever see her talk to the walls?

I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.

Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--

Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--

Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.

You ever think about getting married again?

What d'you tell her?

We must go, Holiness.

All quiet?

Mama, my story.

And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."

I am sorry, Lhamo.

No.

I do, now.

I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.

I will buy them for you.

Goodbye, Kundun.

We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.

Dalai Lama.

We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.

Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.

You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.

This many?

The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.

True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.

I need to squeeze this brain.

In the Pacific Ocean.

Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.

I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.

We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.

Good day.

You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.

I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.

Do you think I must?

It is a story, you decide.

We have enemies.

This is Britain.

This is Tibet. And this is China.

The people want you made Dalai Lama.

You have grown up very good.

Tell me.

This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.

Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.

No.

You can't take a cow by eminent domain.

Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...

You're a beautiful woman.

Go!!!

I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?

Keystone what?

Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.

You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--

Jesus Christ!!

What are <u>you</u> doing?!

That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--

Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?

Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?

I can arrest you!!

No!

<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.

The more he thrashes, the better.

But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.

Such the flirt.

He was an Indo-pacific.

<u>Jack</u>!

Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?

What?

I'm okay.

Did you make anything of the tooth?

How big do the bears get?

And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?

Oh my God.

Same thing from Fish And Game.

What are you doing?

That was an awful thing to say to me.

He thinks they're what?

You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.

Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.

Like little children.  You okay?

Sorry.

That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?

Thanks for the... bandaid.

Well.  Goodnight.

I'm not mushing it.

Calm down.

What?

You think?

I'm ready when you are.

Are they feeding?

Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.

They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.

Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.

I wouldn't.

And this is how he came to the boat?

Not yet.

With what?

Was that like a homo-sexual remark?

He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.

<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.

Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.

They're coming right in.

Should I?

Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?

That's not what you came to say.

Sorry?

I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--

I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--

Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?

<u>You</u>?

No.

Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?

Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.

Lecter said a lot of things.

Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?

Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?

Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...

What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!

He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.

Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?

Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?

Starling, Clarice M., good morning.

Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?

I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?

Miggs has been murdered.

Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here.  Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.

When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.

The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -

But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.

Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?

I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?

With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.

Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.

Yes sir... I'll do my best.

And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?

They said she was just rags, like somebody -

Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.

I am, yes.

No, I came because we need -

Reasonably so. Yes.

And the questionnaire...?

No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.

Your bleeding has stopped.

Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?

And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?

Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?

She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.

He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.

Two months.

I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.

I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?

Not "just," Clarice. What set you off? You started what time?

I heard a strange sound...

They were slaughtering the spring lambs?

Where were you going?

You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?

Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?

The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...

Why didn't you bury those people?

Your "father"?

They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.

What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?

What is it?

Are we safe?

Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?

What?

You still have an aversion to the water?

Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?

Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...

He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.

Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.

Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?

I don't understand!

Any powder?

That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.

A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.

The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.

What happened to you?

Things were done. Nobody was spared...

This is the signature of Webb.  And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.

I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.

Sergeant! Form three ranks!

Advance, Sergeant Major!

Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.

Excuse me. What did you say?

Yes.

Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!

Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?

Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?

Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.

Are you planning on working tomorrow?

What's wrong?

They found this?

Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...

I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...

We're getting out of here just in time.

That's an order!

Where the hell've you been?

You did good...

Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...

That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.

What can we do?

They know, don't they?

What about our quota?

Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...

Give me a readout, DeJesus.

Okay, number 23's full.

How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?

Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.

But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!

Forty-eight hours!

You read Russian?

Still bothering you?

It's Sixpack!

Burritos...Enchiladas...

Look.  Water.

We've got to get him to the infirmary.

I'm going to try to remove it.

It would explain the suction- like appendages.

The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...

Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...

What is it?

Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?

I'll kill him!

How much did you part with?

When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.

I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.

Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.

Bacon, see what we got.

I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?

Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!

What's that?

Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .

JD.

They were going to pay, then?

Son, have a look in his locker.

Son?

Yeah?

Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.

OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?

We gotta get those guns.

Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.

There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.

What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?

It must be this one.

My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?

That's it all done, we are off.

I hope this is the right move.

I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.

What do you mean?

Everything all right out there, Tom?

That's if I want to see you.

I'll see ya.

That you, boy?

Yes?

Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.

And that does include the amp?

Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.

Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?

You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.

My van is half full.

If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?

Where did you get those from, a museum?

There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?

The money, the gear!

You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.

Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?

I don't know what the big deal is.

--you're going to be on your own.

Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.

That makes it okay?

Please.

Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?

Why don't you start with that?

Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?

And you and Private Graves--

We're not running a dating service here.

Private Johnson!

Nice job.

Charley Wade.

--it didn't come out of a cereal box.

A .45--

There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.

Oh. Right. And you're in--?

You still going to all the home games?

Yeah, well--

Same weight I always was.

Hey, it's the General.

He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--

Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--

You didn't go telling your father you were here?

He's a pretty tough old man, huh?

PDA?

Yeah. He lives here, right?

Right.

Cliff--

It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--

They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.

I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.

--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.

You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch--

That where he was shot?

Deal drugs in the bathroom--

Right.

Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]

I haven't seen anybody doing that.

There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.

No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]

Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?

This girl has a child?

Historic occasion, isn't it?

That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.

I heard there was a bit of a fuss.

Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?

He still living?

Besides my father, I mean.

Imonna find out one way or the other.

The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.

Sam--

I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.

He agreed it wasn't exactly news--

There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--

Steve called for you.

Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.

Mami, how old were you when my father--

Nobody's too busy.

I've seen 'em.

You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?

You had to deal with him in running the club.

He squeezed money out of you?

Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?

Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.

Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.

Mom?

You gonna stay out here?

She finally got in--

Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.

Morning, Sheriff.

It was for personal consumption.

He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--

And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.

You built our patio while you  were on the county?

She's done well for herself--on her own and all--

I thought you got through that pretty well.

So why did you come back here, Sam?

It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.

When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.

So what are we gonna do about this?

There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--

It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--

From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.

Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--

The Republicans?

You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--

Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--

We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.

I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.

Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.

I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.

That's Butterfield...

You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.

I'll tell you.

Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!

Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.

I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.

Will you come to him on your knees?

He's with us...

And are you afraid?

We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.

Sorry.  You asked.

That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.

What did you find?

He was the real thing, right?

Stuff?

He taught all this to Swann?

It's okay.

Nothing's going to happen to you.

I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.

Harry?

No!  No!  No!

Harry?

What the fuck?

What about me?

... they believe you.

Oh God.

And this Butterfield guy--

You believe that?

I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.

They weren't worth a damn.

Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?

Shit.

Go away.

It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.

Why'd you come here?

What for?

I like to know why things happen.

I can't let you in.

Leave her alone --

You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?

Don't bother.

Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.

Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.

Hold on.

I only wear ties for funerals.

I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.

They got here before us.

Nobody's better off this wav!

This is where we killed him.

He did something with the ground.

The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.

Call me tomorrow.

Have we met before?

Why's that?

What is?

Just get me out of here as soon as you can.

What did you study?

Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?

Of course.

Hans was very attentive to you.

Really?

Oh, for her show?

Yeah? But look at you.

No one ever tells you that...

Nice one.

It's bad isn't it?

Do you ever see him?

When are you leaving?

You're leaving right now?

Why are you crying?

Mr. Harris?

Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.

That's not what I'm talking about.

I don't know.

Not all that pasta.

It's ok.

When are you coming home?

Evelyn Waugh?

Hair stuff?

See you later.

Yeah.

Oh, the record company sent these...

Lauren?

John! What are you doing here?

Uh...sure...I...what?

You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.

So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?

Your court order, Dr. Allen.

It's the patient's request, doctor.

The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.

I don't mean to belittle you, but we've been through this before.  Satan is not what you think he is.  Satan is not some creature.

Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.

So all that bullshit about God and faith.

Why are you doing this to me?

So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.

Father, please don't die.

Peter...Peter Kelson.

Yes... and you are?

So what'd I miss?

Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?

And the point is?

Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.

When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."

It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.

What about after?

Plenty of time.

He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.

How much time do we have?

Oh, Peter.

You don't want to face it.

I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.

You know what?  You can go.

The police used him as a witness in this case.

Yeah.

Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?

It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.

Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.

He could see me.

Ah, Mom.

I hate it.

Taste this.

You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.

Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.

Yeah, you met her?

Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.

She needs to stop running around like a little boy.

Which one for tomorrow?

Okay.

You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.

What?

That was nice.

Wait...

I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.

Damn, girl.

A horse?

Like you don't give her a hard time.

I found you someone.

I told him you looked like me.

I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.

What's up with that?

Thanks, Sidra.

Thanks.

So what are these Spanish guys like?

One, up.

I never knew a girl that could play.

You do act different.

I think we gotta kiss now.

Way to hoop.

Look, big head, I'll be at your car.

What's that?

I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.

See you made it.

Early night for you, isn't it?

Why?

What'd it say?

It's okay, little baby.

Then prove her wrong.

Clothes.

Give me the ball.

What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...

He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.

You weren't at my game.

I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.

What?

You're what?

Shouldn't you be lying down, or...

I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.

You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.

No.

Zeke.

With who?

Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?

I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.

Still the man.

You scared me.

Just...leave it alone.

Why not?

Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.

Yeah?  So you up for a game later?

Still is, so let yourself out.

I ain't a damn liar.

Good.

C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --

Hey, Janet, it's Chad.

Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?

Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?

Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?

FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

Yeah, but I don't know --

No.

No.

Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.

ok.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --

I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.

Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --

Great, bye.

You wanna make a deal with me?

It's ok.

....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?

No, what's wrong?

Hello.  You're back again, huh?

-- what kind?

What?

Can you hold it?

I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia.

LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GET HIS MONEY AND GO -- DID YOU GET HIS MONEY? DID YOU GET IT?  DID YOU GET HIS MONEY, DAD?

BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --

GIVE US YOUR MONEY.

It's ok --

Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know --

Check that ego - come off it - I'm the profit - the proffesor Ima teach you 'bout The Worm, who eventually turned to catch wreck with the neck of a long time oppressor And he's runnin from the devil, but the debt is always gaining And if he's worth being hurt, he's worth bringin' pain in - When the sunshine don't work, the Good Lord bring the rain in.

Doc it's Janet.

I'm sick.

I'm sick and I'm in love.

You mind your own bussines.

Give me your keys, Don.

He has Phil right now.

And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?

"yeah."  the fuck do you know?

Other fuckin' assholes like me.

...cocksucker....

...I can't hold onto this anymore...

...gimme that fuckin' phone...

This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:

...Lily...?

She had cancer...from her...in her stomach and I didn't go anywhere with her...and I didn't do a god thing... for her and to help her....shit...this bitch...the beautiful, beautiful bitch with perfect skin and child bearing hips and so soft...her namewasLilysee?  He liked her though he did, his mom, Frank/Jack...he took care of her and she died. She didn't stick with him and he thinks and he hates me, ok...see...I'm...that's then what you get? ....are you still walkin' in that car...?

Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.

That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.

I'm confused about your past is the thing.

-- just to clarify --

Are you asking me that?

I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --

Do you remember a Miss Simms?

Yeah.

Time's up.  Thank you for the interview.

Why does that sound silly?

And your father?

I'm sorry.

And you ended up at UC Berkely --

Where does that name come from?

And "Frank?"

Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --

.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --

You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --

I AM CALM.

You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?

This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --

Are you ok?

I'm sorry.

You want her right now?

...No...I don't hate you.  Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?

I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....

That's it.

No.

Just once.

What? No, Rose, jesus, no --

Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?

I think that you know.

I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.

I'm Bob.

Can I come in?

Do you still have to do homework?

Was it a call back?

Where will the money go?

You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?

You been on Prozac long?  Dexadrine?

You motherfucker...you motherfucker.... YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

What would you like?

Mmm.Hmmm.

yeah, I said.  Is that it?

Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.

They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.

I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.

Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?

I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.

No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.

...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?

God smiled upon us.

There were two.  Not one.  But two.

I am preparing for a ball!

What is it, mother?

How can I serve you in this?

And some problems cannot be settled without one.

What are they doing?

Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?

The Prison of Belle Sur.

Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.

How is he?

You can do it.

Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --

Go on.

Now.  You were saying?

Poor Phillippe!

Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.

He seeks redemption.

Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.

A simple theological discussion.

Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.

No!  Stop --

Pull them back!

I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.

Forgiveness.

A tomb?  We're in a tomb?

It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.

I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --

But why?

We go someplace dangerous.

He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.

It worked!

That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!

But -- are you sure?

Michelle cannot possibly accept!

Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?

Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.

Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.

I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.

I heard your playing.

You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.

Raoul is everything to me.

Athos, please...!

Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself.

Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!

If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.

He lies.  He is here to trap us.

You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?

These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.

Phillippe...?

One for all.  All for one.

You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!

Silence!  I order you!

Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --

Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.

What number, on the first page?

Exactly why it should be given away.

The food doesn't please you?

This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.

I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.

Raoul... Oh, Raoul...

I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.

You mind if I ride with you?

What do you think?

Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!

I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!

What the hell is this Marvosa!!

So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.

If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.

Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?

Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.

Anyhow...	you wake up and she's gone. But--  --this is my favorite part--  she leaves you the keys to a brand new Beemer.

What?  Wait a minute -

Where is he?!!

Speak of the devil.

Captain?

Where up north?

You always carry a gun with you?

I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.

I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.

Jesus, man...

I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.

I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.

OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.

So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.

I'm stranded out here.

Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.

What would your - boyfriend - think?

You don't seem afraid of much.

What?

No.  It wasn't like that!

He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.

If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?

What have we missed?

And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.

The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.

Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place...

We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.

You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?

I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...

Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?

He is good. Bur not as good as Price.

A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.

Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.

We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.

You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.

What'd it say?

Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah- jongg piece.  It means Red Dragon.  That mean anything to you?

From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.

Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.

It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...

There has to be.

Something Lecktor said.

You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?

Will...?

Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.

Not yet.

Can you give me an idea of the conditions...

What's being photographed?

The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?

How did you come to Gateway?

You worked out well.

I'll probably go back to it someday.

Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?

THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.

SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...

Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.

Are you a man?

Come in.

I want to see Lecktor now.

It's Will Graham...

In a holding cell.

This is Will Graham. Can I help you?

He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.

I don't want to do that,

Why do you think he took his gloves off?

If I were?

Hello, hotshot!

To do what?

Blue is cold.

You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?

Do you remember what you said?

What's this Mama shit?

Let's forget who said what to whom...

It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?

What do you want?

Are you gonna kill him?

Did the girl die?

Did you get my card?

A layman..., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'

Do you dream much, Will?

What were the yards like?

You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?

I don't have one right now.

No.

Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.

Sitcom...?

Andy... this is every comedian's dream.

Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.

Andy!

Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --

George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.

Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...

Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?

Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.

Really?

B-but... we saw... your neck...

Ten.

Cue the commercial!

What do you mean?

Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!

You're not listening to me --

Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!

T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --

So?  What do they know?

Give me the book.

"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"

"... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  His parents are at his bedside.  Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi"...

I, I was asked to do this material - -

Are you at peace with your family?

"Philosophically"?

It's probably just a strained muscle.

No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.

Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.

Why is he saying these things?!

JESUS CHRIST!!!!!

Bob Gorsky.

You don't know.

You got the money?

Did you hear that?

I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.

Hello, Trinity.

I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.

Is that...?

Do you always look at it encoded?

Thanks... for the drink.

All right --

Holy fucking shit!

How?!

Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.

The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.

We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.

Get some rest.  You're going to need it.

I thought it wasn't real.

No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?

What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?

Set down in there.

How does she know?

Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.

Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?

Got it.

That vase.

I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.

You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.

Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.

What's funny?

I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.

Who is?

From what?

Get this thing out of me!

Is it?

No one has ever done anything like this.

Morning.  Did you sleep?

Where is it?

Holy shit!

Why?

Operator.

Which way?  Which way?

It's locked.

Tank, you're hurt.

An Agent!  You have to send me back!

It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?

Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.

We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.

Sssh!  Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.

Well, we want good stuff.

Hey hold it!  Gimmie the cash.

No.

You flew before?

Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.

Next time, bet with your own kind.

It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.

Nah.

What do you mean?

You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.

I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?

I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.

I'm going to work this week...I mean it.

Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?

Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!

NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???

I think we should see your uncle.

Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.

Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?

How much?

Diane, how are you feeling?

In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.

No...no stripping...as the hostess.

Uncle, how are you feeling?

"Francis Macomber."

"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."

Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...

That W.A.S.P. bastard.

I'm going to take that apartment uptown.

I can take care of myself.  You know that.

...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?

The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!

Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.

Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?

Don't count it...it's all there.

How about me?  I don't get a drink John?

I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.

I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.

Did he?  That's more than we get to do.

I hate parties --

I know you do, darling.

What is this?

Hi, Daddy, what do you think?

I wasn't going to say --

Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.

I would prefer some peanut butter.

We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --

We have an arrangement now.

Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?

Yes.

It doesn't matter.

'Yes'.

I was saying to Quince we won't need --

Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --

It's going to be great --

Is there any more to it?

Have we met?

I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.

That's it?

I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.

I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --

Well, I guess he's found one.

He was interested.

The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.

You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?

I nuttin' to do wi' dat.

Not time yet.

No, I come to see Doctor.

Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.

You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.

You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...

Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.

Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.

You think so?  How do you know?

Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?

'Big'?

You act like you never had peanut butter before --

Very well, I'll watch.

No.

Where are you going?

'To bed'?

Thank you.

I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --

Where are you going?

For how long?

We know so little about each other --

You think so?

Good morning.

Sounds fair enough.

A 'deal'?

-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --

I'm not everybody.

-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?

Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.

Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?

How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.

I couldn't sleep.

'Spooning'?

-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.

Thanks.

Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.

Are you threatening me?

An offense --

The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --

What question?

Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?

Not my birthday again?

Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?

That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.

Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.

Thank God.

You know each other?

It'll come back, Daddy.

Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?

Then what is it?

Where's Joe?

This is crazy --

You don't know anything about Joe --

If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.

Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?

How'd you know?

I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --

...We know so little about each other.

MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 85.

30.

Well, what then?

Amnesia?

No, let's go.

Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.

Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.

And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *

I haven't made a strong enough impression.

Where'd you get it?

Why?

It's isolated.

How do I know he did that to you?

What does he want?

Did you?

You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?

Neither do I.

What?

Calm down.

Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.

My wife.

I'm meeting someone called Natalie.

My boyfriend told me about you.

Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.

I don't know. I'm sorry.

I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.

I'm not appealing the decision.

You've read it a hundred times.

I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -

Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?

Who?

Why?

It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.

We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.

So was he scared?

So what are you gonna do now?

Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.

She couldn't.

What sort of questions?

How do you know him?

What's wrong?

Why? You're never going to know.				  *

You probably.							 *

I should kill you.							 *

It is now.

No.  I was in Namibia...

We know these people...!

What do you think?

We're not certain...

You need to consider a few issues.

So...?

Where's that?

Tell <u>me</u> everything.

...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.

Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.

I do.  We don't do business with him...

He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?

Stevens?

They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them?  Or what?

Where the hell are you, man?

Where?

...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?

Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...

Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.

What is going on...?!

Hello?

Never heard of him.

What are you talking about?

You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...

Where are you?

As in, your ass is dead in the water.

Who are you talking to?

So?

Okay.

...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...

Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.

I think José suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...

It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. José knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.

What do you care?

I gotta, I gotta go...!

They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if...

You ain't coming to work?

I think you just put your finger on it, I do.

Forget it.

You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night.

Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!

Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.

Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.

Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.

Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...

But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.

I'm scared.

What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!

You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?

Hey -- whatsa matter?

What d'you want?

What you got me up here for?

Here. Don't even thank me.

Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?

Ready for hard work, son?

You got it.

Two kilos.

To what?

Too bad you didn't have a machine.

--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.

Haps, railroad, bus timetables?

Right!  That's what we're shooting for.  Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here.

No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.

Yes...?

Just Erich.

What's wrong?

But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?

Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...

What?

Max, sit down. You're in no shape to kill anybody.

Why the suit?

Billy, what's the matter?

Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.

Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.

What'd the Prosecutor say?

Lady...

There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...

Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.

Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?

I only got...

You feel anything?

Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...

Can we get this car there?

The lights come up, you pull the switch.

It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.

Which way?

We're no leaving you!

Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...

Thought it was my week for that.

This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!

Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...

His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!

Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...

No...

An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.

Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.

My God.

I'm not much of a critic.

Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.

No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.

Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.

When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.

I can take it, go ahead.

...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.

I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.

I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.

For a while I thought I might go crazy.

I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.

You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?

What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?

Then light the match, Paul.

I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.

Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?

And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.

Set what up?

Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...

I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.

Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.

Annie, what is it?

That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.

Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.

Now don't fuss, Paul.

I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--

I know you do. I love you too, Annie.  And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.

Did I do good?

Could be the weight of the snow.

You really think Sheldon's out there?

I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.

I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.

People sure like those Misery books.

I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.

Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?

When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.

Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.

Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball game went into overtime. If anybody ever told me I'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double, I'd...

How grateful?

On what.

Magic...

Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..

Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..

Not exactly.  Wallis?

What you got there, mate?

There she is.  I got visual.

I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.

- right..where is it?

I wouldn't do that.

The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.

What's the population of Seville any idea?

No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?

-- his left jacket pocket.

Easy, easy, easy, shhh!

Are you okay?

No.  Should I?

Right now only Ambrose knows that.

Excuse me?

Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.

We think we've got our finger on the buyer.

Something else?

I don't.  No exactly.

Nekhorvich's boss?

Left jacket pocket confirmed.

I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.

Let's start from the inside out.

Luther, say again.

Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?

You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.

Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..

The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.

That's S.O.P..

<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!

You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.

Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisíll have to be quicker than Iíd like. Certainly quicker than youíd like.

Satisfied?

Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.

Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.

Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.

There was nobody on the bridge.

What?

Where were you?

That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?

Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.

I just need you to be safe.

Kittridge...

What are you going to do?

Two cars.  Where are you?

Youíre in Prague?

No sir.

For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.  We have a penetration.  The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."

Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...

What are we downloading?

What makes you trust me?

I'm not letting this list get out in the open.

Mm - Hmmm...

<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.

I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.

Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.

You're not going to any meeting without me.

That's not it.  That's not the list.

Jack.  Jack.

He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.

Ethan.  Heís out of pocket.

Would you remove your hat please?

Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.

Iíve got a shadow.

Where are you?

- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.

Hey, I showed 'em to you!

- no.  She canít know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Thereís too much at stake, Ethan.

You got it.

Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?

No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?

Too wicked to have a drink later?

Thirty-two and change.

Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.

Very good, Mr. Johnny.

You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.

I don't know what you mean.

And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.

Oh, Cosmo!

You haven't once said you like my dress.

What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.

Yeah, this is Ronny.

You are going to marry my brother?

How'd he die?

When you get engaged?

When your husband get hit by the bus?

Stupid yourself.

I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.

He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!

Oh my God.

What? What have we done?

I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.

Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!

But that's cause he don't know!

What are you talking about?

Hi.

You look beautiful. Your hair...

No thanks.

What's the matter?

You're making me feel guilty again.

I'm really afraid.

Why not?

Let me go home.

No, I'll tell him.

What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.

Bye, Aunt Rita.

You don't want the fish.

It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.

A man who can't control his woman is funny.

We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.

Alright. A month. In a month.

I can't. I need my family around me now.

And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!

In time, you will see that this is the best thing.

And we'll sell the house.

Hi.

I don't wanna talk about it.

Your hair's different.

No.

Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.

Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fiancé, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.

I know.

He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.

Don't fight.

Don't make yourself sick.

Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.

That's it! That's the reason!

I'm sure she did.

I'm sorry if we disturbed you.

Sorry. That was rude.

Nerves.

You knew that man?

I guess you can't invite me in?

I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.

It's a house.

I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.

I don't know.

What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancé's in Palermo.

She's got it.

Burn her anyway.

I see.  Yes, of course.

No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.

Oh!

Oh!

All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...

Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.

Yes ...

What is that?

What word?

What, "is"?

Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...

You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.

All right, we'll call it a draw.

I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?

Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?

What is your name?

Ni!

You know my name?

That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.

What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...

Sorry ...

I'm averting my eyes, Lord.

Nothing... There's your ninepence.

I think I'll go for a walk.

My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!

Thanks very much.

Well taken, Concorde!

Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!

Did you kill all those guards?

You killed eight wedding guests in all!

Gosh - Is he all right?

It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...

One day, lad, all this will be yours ...

Father, lad.

Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.

I don't want land.

But I don't like her.

How?

Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.

We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.

If we ... er ... 

Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?

Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?

Well, look er, I ...

Well,  what seems to be the trouble?

There's nothing wrong with ... that.

No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!

I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.

You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!

So?

What?

Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.

She's got an army of people to get her up and out.

And she sent no word down?

She'll get over it.

What's this?

The place is a mess.

Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?

Checked and locked, sir.

Good man.  And is she all right?

Do you know who you address, sir?

But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --

You'll be sent a message.

I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.

That can wait till the weekend.

This is a slur on her good name.

Dare say you can be taught.

Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.

Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.

You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.

So...?

They don't see it.

Yes.  That will be company for you.

Mr Brown.

Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.

Ma'am?

You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!

-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!

Then they may read about me.

Should we take it seriously?

I see the Prince of Wales is here.

A fine choice, sir.

Where did you find it by the way?

Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--

Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.

We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.

No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!

Just tell me the fucking riddle.

We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...

Talk to me.

He thinks I'm "sublimating".

I have to talk to you.

Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.

What do you mean by "weird"?

See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!

Something's happened to them.

Well?

This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?

That's what I thought.

The Police, then...

Then where do we go?!

SLIP-STREAM.

I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.

I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.

You feel it?  It's different this time.

Our time's up.

What the fuck is that?!

So that's what we almost died for?

Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!

But I don't understand...

Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?

A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point.  What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.

So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?

So how do I start?

They fired everyone.

And?

So what's the problem?

Beautiful night.

Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?

A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?

I understand.

So, what did they say?

Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.

Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.

Your Aunt called me.

Get going. You don't want to be late.

That's okay.

I think so. I was just taking a shower.

I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.

Hi.

No, no, I'm fine.

You're still here?

Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...

Number 17.

I think I've been hurt.

I don't know.

The money. You don't know where it came from?

That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.

"You're still here?"

"So... surprise"...

"Before I kill you."

I don't think...

No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.

Yes, Sir.

Betty Elms.

Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.

Yeah, what for?

It's kind of embarrassing but,

Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?

Nice wallets.

No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.

No.  I haven't seen any.

Is that it ?

Why should we trust you ?

Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?

How do we get out of this room ?

Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?

There's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air. It won't kill you, but it will hurt.

Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !

Do you have something better to talk about ?

There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?

How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?

Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.

You okay ?

Are you Matthew Parker ?

OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!

Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ? 

An elevator ?

Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of.

Where ?

He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.

It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.

Stop the hydraulics.

Johnny, let's get the cleanup started.

When you are ready.

I made my bones on the street, you know. I did Riglioni in his own house. I was made in the Family, okay.

You did.

He already had a balance of $600,000.

A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?

Well ?

Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal.

That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.

I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.

I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.

Zachary.

No. I was just curious if what I heard about you is true ?

Are you happy with your salary and position ?

I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.

Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.

The power went out in half the park.

Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !

It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?

Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money.

Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him !

Are you okay ?

Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.

People said she looked like me.

I don't think you're very polite.

What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?

Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.

I'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians.

Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?

Okay, no problem.

Shelly's already told me all about sex.

Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.

Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.

Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.

Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.

Totally.

Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.

I don't know if I want to.

Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.

Reason? What reason?

His name's Harry Sultenfuss.

What're you saying?

Special effects?

And she saved it.

Would you like...eh...to have these movies?

It's good to see Maggie again...and you.

That's okay.

My mother can't have any more kids.

See you? He can smell you from there.

So she had you in jail, in Russia?

Hello.

Vada?

Vada what about you, who have you come up with?

Don't wake up Vada.

I don't need you to be telling me to...

My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.

Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.

Boy, you're really into this.

Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.

Does it work?

Boyfriend?

Let me see if it changes colors on me.

What are you doing? You can't go in there!

What's he smoking?

You mean...it wasn't that terrible?

Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.

Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and....

But...are you engaged or something?

Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.

Well then that's not exactly dating is it.

I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.

Maybe.

A secret, I like that.

I should do this myself.

No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.

Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?

Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.

Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.

I'm just tired.

Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?

Excuse me?

Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?

Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.

Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.

Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.

Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.

They're enormous, I know.

I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.

Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?

Why not now?

Shelly?

Let me hold him.

Do you know him?

No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.

Wanna play?

Hey, you didn't pay me!

It's there.

After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.

You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?

I just had a terrible thought Harry.

I haven't danced in.....

Do you want to?

You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.

How's it going chef?

Can we see it from the back yard?

Watch you don't knock out a fish.

I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.

Ahem.

Of course not.

Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.

The money?

HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.

When?

When??

Is that the fish you won at the carnival?

Do you miss her?

No, no no....

What do you get for that?

Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.

Please.

My Dad was funny?

Is that your camper?

She's shy.

Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.

Did you read ALL these books?

Are you married?

Sure.

So how come you're putting lipstick on?

Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.

I think it should be outlawed.

I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.

Thomas J?

Oh great!

She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.

Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.

It's a mosquito bite.

What's wrong with your eyes?

You have no personality.

Heaven.

But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?

Bed wetter!

They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.

Come on, let's go.

California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.

Get up!?

So now you'll have a mother.

I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.

Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.

Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.

Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.

Yeah, it's in the contract.

Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?

Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.

No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.

You have no appropriate sense of emergency.  My best friend is ruining his life.

He's adored me for nine goddamn years.

There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...

Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!

I give.

How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?

I'm taking my next book to Viking.

My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...

Don't you have to be somewh...

It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...

He sucks soup through his front teeth.

Jesus, we're trapped!

But he always says...

Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...

Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...

In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.

They both have some growing up to do.  But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time.

Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...

I think he's been fired.

And you think he's kept this to himself.

Well, you're a little early...

I've been calling for days!

Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...

Michael, it's Wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on Su...

No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.

Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...

Where was that, Florence, huh?

The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?

Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.

I guess you're right.  That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...

Don't you throw up on boat?

I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.

Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...

You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.

I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.

So we heard it... like, right that... that first...

Takes me back.

This thing means that much to y...

The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...

I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.

The Big Hurt, huh?

What's up?

I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...

Why would she come here...

Almost three.

I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.

Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...

It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...

All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...

Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...

... I'm partial to the tight end.

He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.

What?

I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you.

Then why are you listening to her -

I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.

What do you really want?

Yes.

She's fine.

I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.

He's going to run for president.

That's what he wants.

Well, how about the shopping center?

Hi. I'm John Triplette.

Where'd he ever see us?

D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?

President?

He saw us at Tammany Hall.

Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.

He got killed at a turkey shoot.

You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey

What?

Listen, do you know anything about cars?

He is just wonderful.

But not unless Nashville really inspires me.

What's this?

Listen, your Aunt Ester just died. I'm... sorry... Listen, I really Feel bad now about last night...We had no...

Mom?

The car broke down.

Bye.

When did you start singing?

How long have you been with them?

Are you a close friend of Haven's?

Do you like him?

Stay.

When did you think it would happen?

I knew when I first met you.

How old are you?

I'm twenty-eight

Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?

Yes.

What time?

Are you sure you know what you're doing?

Oh, no.

Where are you going?

How's your stomach?

Probably a little too long.

Come on back to bed.

Well, I really think he's got a chance.

Ryan O'Neal.

Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.

Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.

When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?

What was the color of Tim's belt?

Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?

Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?

Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.

Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?

What kind of pies do you have?

Try to keep it to a minimum.

Mickey!

Hasn't it?

Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?

Who is we?

I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?

So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.

The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?

Yeah.

Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---

Yours.

My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?

Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.

Was what worth it?

That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.

You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?

Tell me about the purity.

Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born killer.

This is crazy. You can't escape like this.

I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.

If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---

Yeah baby.

Through the power of the simple word---

---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.

Yes.

That's the Mickey and Mallory way.

They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.

Apparently, they've seen all our films.

Here's the layout of the laundry room.

Take a wild stab!

Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews...

Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.

Yeah, we met. They're good men.

Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing.

How's it working, Scotty?

But you see, that's okay, Wayne.

By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.

I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.

How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?

Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?

Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---

We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.

Why don't we make it three deputies and you?

It sure is.

I bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. Wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!

'You Duff Anderson?

I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!

Look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you're plannin' trouble.

I said: Cut it out!

Walker and Williams.

James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.

They say your dad's 'round town.

Looks like you're doin' a good job.

And his age?

Any other family?

It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.

That's two bucks, Joe.

You working?

Oh yeah?

Yes, aren't you?

So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?

Well, that's a funny thing to say.

Hell!

How d'you mean?

Get out of here!

That's why you come back, huh?

Not here, Duff.

Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.

Yeah. It's just like I figured.

Yeah. Well, I do.

I'm just going in to do my shopping.

How did it go?

Thank you.

What happened, Duff?

I can see why.

What about him?

Is that so?

You know how to box?

My kids want me to teach them.

Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!

Don't look so scared.

Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.

Don't deny me, Duff.

I'm trying to help, Duff.

You were plenty scared that night in the car.

Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.

Ain't you goin' to say something?

What you gettin' all pretty for?

A whole lot, Frankie.

That's right.

My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?

Come back some other time, will you?

Going back, huh?

They'll run you out.

No, thanks. I'll take the bus.

Don't be too hard on him.

Hello.

Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.

Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?

You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?

So I been told.

Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.

Come on, Will.

Shut up, Will.

Let's go.

Omar--

I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.

How long's it been?

Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?

She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?

What about her?

Alright. Let's talk business.

Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape.

Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.

If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.

Then I'd ask you what your terms are.

You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.

Why'd you do it, Armitage?

First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.

You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".

Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.

Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.

Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...

So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.

Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.

Four men. Babylon soldiers.

Yo.

Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.

How much time you got left?

You haven't got it?

This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.

You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.

I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.

His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.

What about before that?

I'm going in.

Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.

The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.

The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.

Case... it's four a.m.

My God... these people are insane.

Get up.

How are you at riddles, Peter?

Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.

How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.

It is?

Remember, that poet that we liked  the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.

Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.

No Roger from op/ed?

You don't think I can do it.

Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.

You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?

Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.

A--flack jacket.

Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.

It's an expose on cafeteria food.

Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--

Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.

And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!

Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.

Maybe we should go in a different room?

Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.

Hey--what are you thinking about?

Oh.

You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.

That is so--weird that you name your car.

How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?

It's just for a couple of months.

It was a long time ago -

Josie Grossie.

Are mom and dad here?

Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.

Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.

You're twenty-three years old!

Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.

No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.

No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?

Whoa. Deja Vu.

So what are you thinking for college?

Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.

Okay This is okay. Smooth.  Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?

You have to say that. You're my student.

I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.

I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.

The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.

Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.

Josie, you look Rufus.

I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.

He sure is big, Jack...

If you went away, what would become of me?

Coming...

What trail are you trying to throw me off now?

Taste it.

<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>

You'd better be quiet, Sandy.

You set this all up, didn't you?  One of your sick jokes?

Come back here!

Wanna join your little friend?

I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!

I'll kill you now.

You two got a thing going, or what?

She giving you any carfare for the ride?

Who told you to choke up that way?

You remember your dreams, Grady?

You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.

The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.

Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?

What?

Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?

Hi!  You didn't have to wait.

You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.

No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.

I think it's sad...

So, you feeling anything?

Disappointed?

What is it - What's wrong?

Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?

You want to talk about it?

You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.

'Morning.

Jess?

So, school going alright?

Maybe we should call a doctor.

We're going up to bed now.

Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.

Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.

Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!

Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.

If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.

If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?

To old friends.  And your new dreams.

Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.

The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.

This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.

Max, where's Kristen?

You need me, I'll be here all night.

I don't know...

You got five minutes.

Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.

Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.

It's over.  It's over.

But nightmares are the common thread?

Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?

All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.

I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.

I can't believe I just did that.

Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?

We can try again.

We made it.  Neil, we made it!

What are we going to do?

You're not going in.  That's exactly what he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.

And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.

In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.

You said something before...about laying him to rest...?

If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.

I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.

Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.

C'mon.

Why is he after us?

That was such a great evening.

We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.

God, that's an enormous arse.

Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?

Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?

That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.

Oh Jesus.

Would you like a cup of tea before you go?

No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.

Thank you.

Here we go.

Probably best not tell anyone about this.

No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.

Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?

Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.

If that's all right.

Busy tomorrow?

It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.

I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.

Here we are.  Do you want to come up?

-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize...

These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...

I have thought about you.

'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?'

Yup.

Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.

You know what they say about men with big feet?

Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.

It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.

Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?

What?

Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?

I don't know what happened.

That's not true.

... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?

Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.

Yes...

Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.

That's right.

I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...

Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...

Bernie -- this is Anna.

By the way -- it's you.

I'll see what I can do.

Ah -- no.  It's fine.

Mr. Thacker?

Buggered?

Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.

So -- you've laid the ghost.

Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.

No, sir.

Can I help you?

I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.

Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.

Yeh, I wrote a couple down.

Maybe.

Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.

Are you sure you...?

Bad news.

So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.

At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?

No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...

Yes, Mister Harding?

Yes, Mister Harding?

Tell us about it...

What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?

P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...

Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!

Yes, ma'am...

All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.

Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?

How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?

Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!

Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.

On this ward?

I'm not finished yet.

Yeah, it'll satisfy me.

Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.

That's it! We made it!

So do I!

Welcome back.

Good. Why don't you join us?

Whatcha boys playin'?

What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!

Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.

Yeah, kid?

H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?

Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?

Say it again.

Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...

In there.

Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!

Go with him, Rose. Go with him.

I second the motion!

Where's Martini and Scanlon?

He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.

Neither do I...

Yeah, my feet are cold...

Ya know what, Fred?

Did to me?

You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?

Giving up?

You can come back later!

Don't you have any clubs?

Big king, too bad...

Who told you that?

Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?

Gary Blinker's fulla shit!

Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.

Doc, what can I tell ya?

You bet, Doc!

Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?

How are you feeling?

Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning...

Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.

You look pretty healthy to me.

You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!

Yeah!

Out. It's the way out. So just keep it in your minds if ya ever wanna make use of it.

A dime.

I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss...

You comin' in to hold my hand?

Okay, Mack!  Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?

Yeah...

That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.

Yeah, how much you wanna bet?

There they are!

Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...

How 'bout twenty?

And you haven't heard the last of this!

Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.

You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.

Excuse me?

Nobody here has any idea which way he went?

So, what's the story with your friend?

She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.

No, really.  What's she doing?

Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.

We found each other, didn't we?

What?

Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.

A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.

Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.

Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.

Smoking or non-smoking?

I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?

That's not the point.

Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.

Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.

I'd really rather not say.

Hi, Peter.

So.  You found him.

Nice dress.

Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.

No.  Are you're leaving?

It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.

As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.

And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.

Hello.

Any night.

Sure.

You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us.

What looks good?

I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?

I don't believe in statistics.

So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.

I don't have an Amana freezer.

Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.

You don't have any idea?

"Thrills"?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?

Come on, it's not so bad.

Kate, is something the matter?

Have you seen him with someone?

Thank you so much.

Live happily ever after.

Now what do we do?

Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.

We're saved!

Couldn't we just have taken a train?

So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?

You think he misses me at all?

Not if you don't count the sixth grade.

He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.

Well, nobody can say we didn't try.

That was really sweet...

Hi-iii...

Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.

I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.

I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.

Peter found him?

Joan Collins stayed here.

Maybe I can change him.

I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.

So...

Kate is that you?

Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--

This is the last one before the wedding, right?

Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.

And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--

Right now?

And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.

And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?

When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.

It'll do.

You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.

Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.

After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.

What do you want me to do, Johnny?

You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?

River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.

Mmhmm.

Mmhmmm.

I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!

See! You don't understand!

It was you, Charley... .

Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.

What happened?  What happened?

Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work with all them muscles. 

I think we're O.K.

I can get home all right from here

What for?

I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.

Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.

Wham... .

Shouldn't we care about everybody?

Why, Terry, who said it was?

What are you crying for?

Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.

Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now but I think we're getting in love with each other.

It's true.

Edie I I never said this to a girl before, I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for, but you you're... .

I've been sittin' in the church.

Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.

My pigeons... .

A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you hadthe only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .

Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.

Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.

It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.

If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.

Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.

Take your hands off me. What you call me?

...walk?

You all right, Nolan?

Nice fellows.

You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?

Waterfront Crime Commission ?  What's that?

You're being served with a subpoena, Mr. Malloy.

You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.

Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and

I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.

Boy, you must've been up early.

Give me a double.

You ought to go home and take care of that

Hey, Skins  --get away with that sheet metal all right?

Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.

H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?

Count this.

Do you?

You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.

Go on a little present from your Uncle Johnny.  And Mac, tomorra mornin' when you shape the men put Terry in the loft. Number one. Every day.  Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on the coffee bags. O.K.?

It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?

Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.

You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.

Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?

A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.

Listen Nolan

I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!

Something's making that music.

Could it be some kind of college initiation?

I'm so frightened.

What can we do?

I am--It's our only chance.

All right.  Put it on heavy.

You love me then?

The moon is almost gone!

There are others.

Your pleasures of course!

You may take her now.

Then it is some service you desire of us.

No. No! No!

We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.

I could make her another Cleopatra...

You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.

Oh, is this Adele?

Yes.

The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?

Why not?

Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.

You were his what, his box?

You say you perform in the Miami area?

Go away, or I'll call the police.

Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?

Do we need him?

I'm just saying she wasn't scared.

You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.

What?!

Jack?

They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.

Outside of that.

I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?

How long you talk to her?

How long were you with the girl?

You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.

Now that's a really big house.

I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.

You find out?

So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?

You know they gonna set us up.

They look like plain old rocks.

I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.

You talked to him?

You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.

I have to qualify, is that it?

I'm at Adele Delisi's.

All right, but...

Sure, Daniel.

That's all I wanted to know.

You can live or die, it's up to you.

You excited?

You know, I'm not in homicide any more.

Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.

That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.

Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.

Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.

Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.

This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?

If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.

Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.

That's funny.

I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.

Is that right?

I mean, romantically.

It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.

Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?

I like your hair.  And that suit.

Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?

If I had answered, what were you gonna say?

You really wear that suit.

You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.

You were going to see her?

I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.

Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.

Wait in the car.

I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.

Whose blood you got all over you?

Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?

I hear six.

You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.

Thanks for your help.

It's a little late for me.

I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.

Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?

What's it mean, "No Hair"?

The flight?

But you're sure we've met, huh?

But I thought the whole thing was your idea?

Why's that?

But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?

You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.

I wanna talk to you about a job.

I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.

So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?

Thing I'm worried about is you.

That was some shit, huh?

It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.

How's it going?

Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.

Moselle Miller?

I'm looking for Maurice.

You fit another Chanel suit in here?

He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.

He's about to.

No thanks.

Dad...

What are you thinking about?

Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?

A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...

In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?

...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.

Thank you...

I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...

That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.

Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?

Midge.

What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way.

I wish she could forget him.

You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.

Nervous?

Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.

You're Walker, right?

That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.

Rafe's girl, Evelyn?

I th-think I'm gonna like it here.

Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!

Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.

Land of the free...

How could you do this?

Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.

Nah, you go on.

Sorry.

I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.

I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.

She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.

This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!

I got a half a tank.  You?

It's not getting any longer.

What about easier to hit in an air raid?

Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.

I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.

Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?

Then wh-where do we land?

I heard what you did.

Well sure, Colonel --

Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.

Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.

What else can we do?

Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.

Fook ya!

I have'na been able ta --

It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.

Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.

Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.

What's the matter?

Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!

There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.

I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.

You got a Tab?

You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...

Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.

Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.

There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..

You really love me, don't you?

But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.

Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love  Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?

What about everything I said to you this afternoon...

What're you doing here?

Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.

Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.

What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.

Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!

I thought you were...for a while.

I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.

Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.

Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.

I beg your pardon?

Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?

You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.

Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.

I was impressed with what you said in English class today.

Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellO for me, Mom.'

Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...

Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.

But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.

Ssh. He's great.

I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.

Young lady, you're drunk!

Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.

You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.

All right. But this better be good.

Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.

That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.

I wanted to apologize for this morning.

Yes.

That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.

I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -how could you do that?

Mom!

I have a note.

I'm excused.

My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.

What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?

When did you start drinking coffee?

What happened to you?

Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.

That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.

Where have you been?

Isn't that awfully forward?

No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes JellO.

You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.

What are you doing?

Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.

I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.

Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.

Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.

The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a foureyed worm.

I guess part of us never really leaves high school.

It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?

I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?

Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.

I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.

You look pretty good for a corpse.

The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.

Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.

Silicon is from sand.

You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?

No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.

Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.

Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--

I was building a doggy door.

What?

Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.

What do they do up there?

Hey! Where're you off to?

Zowie...

I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.

Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.

It's getting pretty late. We better go.

I gotta go back and do my chores...

You ever think about running away?

Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?

Are we interrupting, Andy?

What was the file name?

Thanks, Walter.

This time. What about next time?

Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles.

What's wrong with you?

I'm ready...

It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.

Thanks, Charles.

Innocuous?

Client of yours?

Congratulations.

Kids are great.

I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.

I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?

Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.

So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.

One more thing, Your Honor...

I'm a law suit.

Get it?

Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?

Opera?

Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.

Do you take risks?

Do men have sex with each other in that theater?

No. I can't really see it.

Hello?

Gillman says I'm fine. My blood work is excellent. T-cells are up. Just a sec ...  Yes, I think that would alleviate most of our concerns.  My platelets look good too.

And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.

Objection!

Objection!

Objection!

The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.

Leave that.

Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.

It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?

A homosexual encounter.

Great.

You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!

How many gays do you know?

Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.

I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.

And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.

Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?

Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?

You taught him a lesson.

Attorney for the plaintiff?

Julius!

That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.

He was doing a great job.

I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...

... But we shouldn't have fired him...

Oh, Lord....

What whispers?

But I just wanted to say --

Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.

So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!

<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.

Just come with me!

They're already dead. Get on board.

'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.

You'd die for them?

What do my eyes see?

Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.

...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more....

And him?

We just keep him locked up forever?

I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?

No, no, I wanted to get away.

Better keep moving....

No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --

I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --

What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?

Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.

15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.

Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.

You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.

You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --

You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?

My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.

How much?

He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?

It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --

Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.

Owens!

You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?

One is all?

Hasan?

They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.

Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --

We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....

She's the captain, we should listen to --

Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.

My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.

Such as.

Aw, this can't be happening to me....

Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?

Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.

An' this?

What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?

Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.

Seal the cave?

Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.

Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.

Do you have to work tonight?

The blood transfusion.

Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.

Hmph.

There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith

He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.

Objection!

Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.

Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?

Gone.

Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?

Air leak. Died in her sleep.

Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?

Who are you?

Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.

I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.

And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.

Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.

One is in a museum!

Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.

I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?

Of course.

Then there is another jungle?

What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.

Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?

You! ... You knew about this?

Listen-

Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.

Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.

Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?

Do you believe him?

Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.

Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...

Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.

You lame Taylor?

Where's Lerner?

First time?

Feel good?

But what'd she actually do?

What you got there - beers?

...you know that night we got hit... I... 

Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?

What we got here a crusader?

He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...

The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.

Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.

Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.

Vancouver, B.C.

Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.

Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.

Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.

Sit down then. We often have a double up here.

Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.

And do you amuse the guests?

Dance?

You said it wasn't a tragedy.

No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?

They'll know whether he killed himself.

Nice of him.

There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.

Dance? Tonight?

Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?

Anything I can do about it?

It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?

It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?

If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?

There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.

Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.

If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.

Well?

I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.

Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.

Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.

It buys things, just like any other kind.

Mine?

Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?

You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.

I'll have to know a little more than that.

We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?

Time's up.  I'm off the case. 

What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.

Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.

Got it on you?

Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?

That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.

Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?

Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.

Where?

I have a warrant for her arrest.

I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--

Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.

What are you doing here?

What do you want?

Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.

Recently, then.

And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't

Got a moment, Inspector?

Send that?

Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.

It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.

What do I get for it?

I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.

... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.

Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.

Where's the shell?

They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?

Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.

Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?

No suicide.

Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?

May you what?

Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.

I don't understand.

Yes, I think so.  Here are two glazed manila envelopes.  One is the bag type.  The other one had the money in it.  Don't ask me how I know.  I know.

This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?

Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?

Well, find out.  Who's covering her?

And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?

I believe you won decorations during the war.

There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.

Get out of here!

It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.

I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.

It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.

My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?

To Ann.

Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now  the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.

No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?

Aha.  James giving some woman the old heave-ho.

Attributed?

Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?

And some of that.  Sorry.

And you'll join me in a sambucca?

Was that your chapter, then?  It was very good.

Can I give you a lift?

What did you think of that Wadja film?

I couldn't bear for it to end.

Did she talk about me?

Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?

I haven't seen much of you.

Might?

C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.

You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...

According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.

The torture of small children--

Hold those rights.

Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.

Susan and I are very old friends, James.

It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.

Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?

Not bad.

Hello, Jimmy.

So how is she?

Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.

And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.

What would you call it?

You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.

You're so famous now.

Don't point it at James!

Ah, Susy, it...

And that's why you never went pro?

Friends of yours, huh?

Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.

The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.

We gonna jump or jerk off?

Talk.

You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.

Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!

Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?

What?

They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.

Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.

Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?

Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.

You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.

I think you gotta hit them straight on!

What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?

The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?

No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.

Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?

Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!

I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.

What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?

This gonna take long?

Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.

Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?

I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--

Bye.

Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?

Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?

No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.

You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!

He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.

No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.

Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...

What have you got in mind, General.

You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.

We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...

We can reach an understanding on this.

Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.

Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.

Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?

What's that long building over there?

Who are you going after next, sir?

What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price.

Mr. Harris.

No, you look like a hooker.

Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.

What's your name?

You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.

Always.

Where are they?  Shopping together?

You really are a very beautiful girl.

What do you like?

Good morning.

I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.

No?  Why's that?

So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?

Four thousand.

Did you buy some clothes?

The Rex.

I'm sorry.

You liked the guy, though.

I thought maybe you'd like dinner.

You still mad at'm?

What id we run into someone I know?

Real genuine guy.

I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.

Do I look okay?

What's that?

Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.

If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.

What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?

Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.

What's up, where you going?

Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...

Love this car!  Is it new?

I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.

And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?

Doing what?

You're being ridiculous.

Oh, my god... Edward, no!

What!?

Edward, we've been together ten years.

We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.

I thought you were giving up that drug shit.

No, let's go to work.  Okay?

Looks slow tonight.

Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.

Yeah... I know what you mean.

It was great.

What kind of school?

Want a pair of boots?

You sure you won't come with me?

Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.

Oooh, I love those.

I'm just going to my room.

In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.

They will serve salad.

Miss Vivian --

Look I just wanted to say goodbye.

Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.

Would you like to try it on?

No, I'm sorry, I don't.

Get out!

Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.

The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.

You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.

Brides often are, I'm told.

To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.

He knows I do not love him.

Rest, Highness.

You mock my pain!

I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.

Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?

Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.

Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.

But what if something happens to you?

We'll never survive.

This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.

We did it.

At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"

I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.

No more rhymes now, I mean it.

Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.

Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.

-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --

Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.

I brought you a special present.

They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?

Yes.

Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?

Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.

Yellin.

She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.

No.

No --

-- all that I have and more please --

What? What?

We're really in a terrible rush.

I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.

I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.

Do you always begin conversations this way?

I admit it -- you are better than I am.

Making sure nobody's following us.

Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.

Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.

You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --

Then make your choice.

You guessed wrong.

A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --

Think it'll work?

You feeling any better?

Guess what.

Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.

You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.

Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.

This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.

According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.

It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.

But that's cheating!

Help!

What was I saying?

Yes, it's quite possible.

What scheme?

Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.

What???

Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.

I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.

It won't run a week!

Do you think he'll take the job?

Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?

Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.

Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.

Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."

"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...

Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.

That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!

Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?

Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?

You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...

Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...

Do it!  Do it!

Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.

We make love?

Finder's keepers.

Feeling better?

Like clockwork.

I solemnly swear...

Hindenburg...

The Graf Spee...

Heil you know who!

I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?

I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.

Very early. Dawn.

What?

Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...

What's your interest?

You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?

I'm in no mood for trouble!

That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!

I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...

It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.

No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.

She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...

Yes.

She stole some money.

Forty thousand dollars.

Mary had been there, one night, and had left.

I'm Mary's sister.

What's the matter?

What thing?

Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?

I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.

No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.

Yes.

You going to wait here for me?

I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?

What?

That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...

Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.

We could laze around here a while longer.

For what?

You can't laugh at it, huh?

I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.

And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.

Hey, we can leave together can't we?

Am I that close to Fairvale?

You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?

A man should have a hobby.

You go out... with friends?

I'm looking for a private island.

If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.

Alright, Miss... 

No, m'am.

Is there?

We have a problem.

Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...

My mother is not dead!

You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?

...Forty thousand dollars!

I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!

Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.

He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.

You didn't find anything.

No mother.

Just before she died she came to--

He's inherited a fortune.

Gosh, you had me fooled.

So--friendly or otherwise--?

No-

I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.

Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?

What's that?

What are you going to do?

[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]

What is it?

What is it now?

Did you hear?

There's no child here.

The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.

I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.

Did you? Where?

Why didn't you eat last night?

I think so.

You wouldn't have said that before you met her.

Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.

If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.

Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?

We'll be coming to the opening.

But it was really my fault.

Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.

What! What are you talking about?

Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?

Meaning what?

I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!

And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.

Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.

Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.

Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.

What!

That's what I said.

I don't remember. Not so very far--

Call the Homicide Squad!

No kiddin'.

Don't give this to anybody else, will you?

Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.

Fine, thanks.

Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --

That's what I said.

--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.

It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.

It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 

Fire insurance!

I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!

And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.

To lunch.

Shall we unpack it?

I'd know him anywhere.

Two: what if I didn't miss?

Mia...?

Could be.

No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.

Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.

I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.

Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.

You better quit that.

Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!

Here comes Daddy.

Did your Momma really give you castor oil?

Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!

He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?

I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.

He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.

Of course not!

What do you think, Brother?

All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?

Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?

Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?

Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?

Wow! Brrrother!

Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.

Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.

So am I.

But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!

The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.

Of course.

Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.

I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.

All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.

They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.

Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.

Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?

That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.

Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.

-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --

Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?

I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.

This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.

Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh?  In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.

Rose, what are you doing up?

You're so sweet.

How can the buttons stand the pressure?

You were up late last night, too, Rose.

Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?

Strange voices, Rose?

Ohhh-hh, ohhh...

Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.

God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.

I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.

Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.

Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.

Ha ha, course you make a lot more.  What's that you got there, Buddy?

Well, no, I didn't actually.

You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters.

Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.

Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.

We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.

Yes, go on.

Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?

Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?

Never again, never again...

Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?

You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.

How much?

Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?

What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.

It's bone dry out there.  Everybody's hurting.  The stuff floating around's been cut so many times it's like powdered sugar, but Zimnermann's gonna fix it.

Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.

Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.

Make a hole, Billy-Boy.

Jiminy Christmas.

Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!

The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?

Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out.  I'll be fine... okay?  How 'bout that... ?  Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!!  Lemme out of this coffin!!

What day is it?

How you doing back there?

Well, I would like to sit in front today.

That's him alright.

No, we're stealing.

Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.

You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?

It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.

Can't I?

He went to pick up lunch.

Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?

Couldn't have said it better myself.

Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.

Thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.

You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?

Pure horse.

Yeah... great.

I can't believe I'm hearing this,

You get him?

You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?

This much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. It's got to be smuggled.

Think Zimmermann's watching?

You always did have style.

This shit was Ming.

Where's your pet gorilla and the female Uncle Tom?

Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.

I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.

Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.

Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.

Yes, my Master.

What is thy bidding, my Master?

I told you to remain on the command ship.

Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?

Luke.

What's going on?

The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.

I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.

Well, look at you, a general, huh?

Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.

Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?

That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.

Ugh!

Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!

Over there! Two more of them!

Tell me.

I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.

Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.

Do you have any tattoos Brad.

You!

He might be.  I don't know.

So please don't tell me to can it.

Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.

Brad, please lets get out of here.

Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.

Right!

Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.

Great Heavens, that's a laser.

You're OK by me.

Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?

Promise you won't tell Brad.

What a guy

"Sweet Transvestite"

"Transylvania"

Was all I had to say

Feeling

Wheeling

Oh, no no, no no.

No no no, no no.

Sha la la la That ain't no crime.

Sha la la la That ain't no crime.

Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.

I think you had better both come inside.

Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.

I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?

Hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later.

Looks quiet, y'know.

Some people are very shy by nature.

Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.

Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.

...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.

...Guess.

It's only temporary.

It's all right -- You're my guest.

They're all the same.

...What?

Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?

Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?

I thought it might be cute.

Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.

What was that you said about a pet shop?

Is everything all right?

No... I can't!

I can't go out.

...That boy damn near broke my arm.

I'll carry him 'till the third.

Damn.

How was the flight, Champ?

Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.

C'mon, man, it's cold, man.

Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!

Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.

That's ten bucks.

...How 'bout for the Cokes?

The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.

Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.

A hundred an' thirty.

Ya sure?

Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?

Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?

Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat.

Mr. Balboa --

Rocky, would you be interested in --

How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.

Goodnight, Rocky.

...What?

'Bout an hour ago.

Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.

Really think so?

Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.

Don't you care what the people will say?

Whatta you get outta this?

God bless ya, Rock.

How am I doin'?

Ya nose is broke.

Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?

...What kinda dog is this again?

Yo, Paulie.

I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.

I usta be deadly at half-ball.

How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.

Ya really like her?

Do you feel you have a chance?

Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.

This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.

Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.

Do you think the rabbit did it?

He's a riot.

Can you get him out of it, Eddie?

Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.

I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.

Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.

I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.

Holy shit, he's a Toon!

Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.

You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.

Does it hurt?

Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.

Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?

It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?

Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...

Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.

You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.

Maybe.  Why?

Well, everybody needs a hobby.

You got the will in there, don't ya?

You tricked me, damn you!

My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.

Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...

How do you know that?

I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!

Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?

Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...

So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?

You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!

Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.

I'll get it.

Wrong number?

If I don't make it back here by ten...

What the hell are you doin' in there?

I think you oughta read it to her.

Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.

Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.

No better?

If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.

Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.

Romeo! Romeo!

Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.

Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.

Out of her favour, where I am in love.

Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?

Farewell, my cuz.

Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.

I'll not endure him.

Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.

Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.

Good marrow, father!

God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?

Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.

O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.

Goodnight.

Juliet!

O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?

How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;

I have.

What?

How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.

That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.

It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.

Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!

Pink for flower.

I will follow you.

Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?

O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.

And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.

I don't know.

Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.

I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.

I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.

Not to me, you know that.

It's quite satifactory.

Yes, Gregor, they sent me.

Do you have it?

He's company.

Where's my information?

Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.

We'll die if we stay here!

Gregor, is that you?

Hello, Jean-Pierre.

He's tough, your American friend.

Are you sure you won't have a drink?

You think you can stitch me up on you own?

Soon.

So this is what, a test?

Long enough to shoot back.

Yeah, well...  My way works too.

What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?

I ride with fat-boy...

Perhaps the police?

Where to?

Pretty much what you'd expect.

Something like that...

Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.

Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.

How did you know?

The question still remains: what do we do now?

No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.

It isn't about money for me, not anymore.

What's this?

What the fuck happened?

Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!

I'm not here very much.

Not here.  They might see it.

Would you stop with that...

The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.

Let's get him out of here...

"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.

What happened to it?

It's the Irish tape we want.

Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.

You slept with her!

Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.

I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  Did you get ID off any of them?

Damn.

I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!

Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.

He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.

Oh, you would have done great.

It won't work.

Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?

I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!

It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.

All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?

We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight.

I've got one condition.

Okay then.  I'll do it.

I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...

Well, we didn't know that at the time.

We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.

I should have known something like this was going to happen!

You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.

He's going to be trouble.

It's gonna be o.k.

You don't know if he was really gonna --

We've got to go now, then.

Dwayne's dead.

Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.

I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.

Whoa, Earl!

There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.

What's wrong?

Yeah I'm fine.

Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.

That son of a bitch.

It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.

Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...

Yeah, I've seen him.

I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?

What?

What makes you say that?

I don't know.

Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.

Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.

Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.

I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.

Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.

Shopping here?

Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?

You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!

Dwayne please calm down!

What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --

I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.

Don't you want it?

Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?

You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?

But nowhere near three million dollars worth.  I would say maybe twenty thousand.

Not in the trunk.

Winner six!

Two-hundred thousand!

So tell me what you know.

I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.

That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.

Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.

They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.

I'd like to pay you for that laptop.

Could you have your partner wait for us outside?

Oh, you American?

Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.

Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.

Carter, get off that stage!

No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.

No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.

All I wanted was a little mu-shu.

Hello.

What's wrong?

That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.

I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.

Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.

It's my job!

You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.

You.

Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?

Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.

Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.

Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.

I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...

Follow the Rich White Man?

Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?

He'll be back soon.

Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.

Get it out of here!

I wouldn't do that!!!

She saved our lives.

I think we should stop talking.

You thinking about that girl that dumped you?

Steamed dumplings?

That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?

Hello, Benjamin.

Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.

We're slowing down.  This must be it.

You've been a good friend, James Carter.

Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!

Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?

We made it, man.

I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.

That your gate down there?

They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.

A little Mu-shu.

Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.

I know who you are, Inspector Lee.

Put your arms around me.

What's going on?

Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.

What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?

Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.

... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.

Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.

If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.

Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?

A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.

The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.

You know what a phone booth is?!

Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?

Shut up!

And that, of course, would be me.

He stole my wheel!

He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.

I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.

What about them?

When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?

What?

You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.

You know War?

No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!

Which one?

Like that.

What are you doing here?

Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --

I could get promoted right out of here.

Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.

This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.

Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.

How much they want?

... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.

I'm talking about the girl.

Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!

What?!

Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...

I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.

Hello.

Hello.

I would like one of my people to help.

I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.

I am so sorry about your men.

And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?

What do you expect me to say to this?

Got any last minute advice?

Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.

Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.

He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.

And in a "V".

I'll get the dress.

I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.

Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?

Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.

Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.

Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...

Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.

The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.

Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.

Yeah.

No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...

Thanks.

I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.

Sorry, no.  I just got one.

I think you'd look good in red.

This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.

Yes, I am.  And who are you?

Your two cinnamon rolls.

Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...

Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?

Did something happen to make you care about reality?

You're going to be very disappointed.

Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.

Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.

You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.

My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.

You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?

Too much.

It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.

No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"

Ike... Hi, Grandma.

No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.

Brian told you that?

No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.

About a minute...?

Yes, you!

You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?

You're a goddess!

There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.

But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!

He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.

You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.

What are you talking about?

Maggie, it's just a joke...

You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.

But it's on the water.

Am I what they had in mind?

If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --

Is that all right with you?

You sure you don't want to drive with me?

We'll stay at the Plaza --

We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.

Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...

You should write something about this.

Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.

You're a basket case.

It sounds like the name of a mattress store --

You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?

Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?

Hello.

Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.

"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."

What are your plans in New York?

No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.

Please --

Everybody! Annie has an announcement --

It's probably just the flowers --

The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --

Magic.  It was magic.

Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?

So you'll get married in a new dress.

Sure you do.

You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...

It's you.

Why not?

What are you going to do, Sam?

Why not?

Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?

Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.

When's the latest time you were out there?

Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.

Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.

You'll find out.

You'll like it.

This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.

Dad --

Dad?  About last night?

Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?

She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!

Jed's got cables.

Bye bye blackbird.

I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.

This one's for both of us.

I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --

Why is she bringing that bag?

Did you call that radio station again?

This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.

Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.

Have you seen my wallet?

I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --

Did too.

No.

Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.

Do you like baseball?

We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by.

It's a little derivative.

Hi.

You look good.

We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --

Is he there?

The men would like to know who this gentleman is.

Mornin'.

Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?

How goes it?

Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.

Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.

Mama, can I put the candles ...

But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen

We did. It got lost in the shuffle.

We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.

I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?

What's the matter?

Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.

Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.

I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.

I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?

I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.

A meeting?

That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?

Tell me.

It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.

Ramón were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.

This is what we've been waiting for.

Aw, cut it out, Ruth.

Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.

Go on. Spill it.

No ...

Luís! Come down here!

Where's your mama?

Ramón ... listen for the love of God ...

Ramón -- listen my kids ...

Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.

Jesus, I look like a raccoon.

How?

What?

I can't.

I can't leave.

Why don't you call the cops?

Then make sure he gets put away for longer.

Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?

How far out of town?

You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.

I'm kind of busy.

No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.

Oh shit

Who is it?

Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?

I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?

How the hell did we get this detail?

Where to?

I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.

But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.

What the hell is that?

You don't trust me?

Can we talk price?

I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?

Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.

Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.

I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.

I'm sorry?

Come on, guys ...

What the hell is this?

This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.

You got a name?

No last name?

Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.

Don't you wonder why I do it?

What the hell are you doing here?

You think this is funny motherfucker?

I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.

Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...

That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks.

The Mexicali Boys

What's on the other end of this thing?

Who'd have thought it?  Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.

Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?

We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.

Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?

When is the deal going down?

A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.

And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.

Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?

Tom, quit fucking around.

My sentiments exactly.

You thinking what I'm thinking?

Golly, I hadn't thought of that.

We're in business.

What is that? Rum and coke?

I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?

Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.

I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.

Jackson?

Last I knew.

What do you think?

He ain't Wade.

Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.

Where?

Watching.

Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.

How about that jeep?

A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.

I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.

Some.

If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.

Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.

No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.

I wonder where they're going.

I'd like to stay, too, Captain.

I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.

There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.

You?  Leading a squad?

What about the company?

Beasley's dead.

A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.

It's not normal, not reading letters from home.

Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.

Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?

SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.

What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?

No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?

Oh, yeah?

No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.

Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.

So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.

Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.

Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.

Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.

Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.

Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...

Up.  We're moving out.

I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.

You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.

Maybe Caen.

Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.

Goddamn it!

The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way.  You hear me, Private?

Thank you, sir.

I'd like to go, sir.

You set?  Sarge nods.

Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.

FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.

Yes, Private.

Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...

Frogs?

But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.

Demolition, right?

How do you do it?

You think he really believed it?

I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.

Pardon me?

Speak with my lawyer.

This evening is over.

Hi.

I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.

Lloyd?

Gee, it's easy.

Then what's love?

Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.

C'mon, just do it.

Wait for me for when I get round to the front. 

You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.

Did you sleep with her?

So, what's your point?

Alright.

I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.

The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.

Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.

Why?

One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.

I didn't think anyone would get it.

Ha!

I won?

Goodnight.

Lloyd?

It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.

Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.

Honey!

Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?

That's right, work it out.

Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?

So we can finally talk?

Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...

Nobody knew me before tonight.

Yeah.

Nice one.

Won't you see me later?

You have to meet Bess.

She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.

It's okay, everybody does that.

No.

Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?

If you'll just maybe ease it into second.

Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.

Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?

I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.

I think that we should spend some time apart.

Well, I need to study, and...

Okay, what did we just decide?

Yeah you do.

She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.

What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.

What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.

You do?

What?

Okay.

Good to know.

Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.

Yeah, she is.  Good luck.

Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.

My car.

Oh boy.

Ooop, excuse me.

It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?

I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.

I love you man.

Later for you, Luke.

What's your name?

I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.

It's not a charade, all this?

What?

There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.

All right, okay, let's talk.

You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.

It's bad business.

You took my workers.

What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?

Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.

What do I got for you?

What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?

Good.  How's it going?

He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -

Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?

Any reason to think next month will be worse?

What?

Don't ever do that to me again.

You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?

You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...

I'll talk to him.

They arrived.

I'll talk to you later.

A one-armed machinist, Oskar?

How's the name search going?

We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.

Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.

You're sure about this two person thing?

I would say we are now officially baffled.

Shit.

Cici. Who's this?

I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.

"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?

WHAAAATT?

Cotton.

What do you want from me, Cotton?

I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.

Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?

Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.

Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?

Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.

How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...

This is exactly what I don't want.

I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?

Why?

Youre the one who got away.

Of course not. Who wants to? Whats the point if we dont get caught? Wheres the glamour in that?

We had to have financing.

Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.

Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.

I never meant to imply...

So what made you change your mind about Sidney?

You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.

And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.

Yeah?

A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?

They're roomates.

The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.

Ssshh! What was that?

Jesus Christ!

You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.

Who is this?

What do you want?

Where are you?

Someones trying to kill me. I need the police.

"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...

No, girletta, I don't leave your side.

We're missing the Sig Ep party.

A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room.

The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...

The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.

I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.

Hello?

Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?

Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?

I'll be right back.

What do you want?

Thanks for the movie, Randy.

I think you got the wrong number, buddy.

Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.

Asshole, Can't talk.

Really? You're such a talented actor.

Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?

I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!

Can I help you?

I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?

Nope.

Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.

So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?

Alright Kincaid, no where to?

Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.

OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.

Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!

The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.

Excuse me?

What do you mean?

Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.

I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.

Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.

I can see nothing's changed.

Yeah?

Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.

Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.

Has anyone else every used your phone?

Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?

Basements creep me out.

Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.

Gale Weathers. What a surprise.

What'd he say?

Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.

See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!

Page 22, Candy's big moment.

Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?

Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.

Yeah?

Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!

How'd you do?

Duh... that's quick.

Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.

Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.

This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?

I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.

I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.

No...

No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.

I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...

But this is life. This isn't a movie.

When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?

I thought you were...

You bitch -- where the fuck are you?

Hello.

So why did you dial it again?

I'm getting ready to watch a video.

Uh-huh.

I'm two seconds from calling the police.

Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.

I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.

Please don't do this...

No...

I don't know...

Now for the real question.

Afraid not.

Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.

Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?

If you'll excuse me, ma'am.

A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.

What is she doing here?

At the airport.

Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.

I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.

Have they found my father?

That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.

Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?

They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.

Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.

Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.

If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.

I'll look for it.

Off the record. No cameras.

And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.

What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?

Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.

Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.

I heard screaming.

Don't come any closer.

For about two seconds.

Besides --  "Takes a man to do something like that."

Which is you...

We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.

His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.

You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.

If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.

Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.

Do you really think Billy did it?

Shit, what is he doing here?

This could be good. What do you think, Sid?

Is Billy going to be there tonight?

How's that?

... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.

How you feeling?

He's being arraigned tomorrow.

Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!

This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.

You didn't know.

I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.

I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.

I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows.  Isn't that true?  How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?

Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.

You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.  And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.

You just met me.

Not here.

You think it was poison?

Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.

The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.

This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.

It's my wife.

How's that?

The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.

No fingerprints?

There must be something.

Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!

I wish I still thought like you.

We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.

Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?

Sorry about that... I just...

Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.

This quote... his first words to us.  I looked it up.  It's from Milton's Paradise Lost.  "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light... "

Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?

How much money do you have?

Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.

How do you know all about this?

The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...

What are you going to say?

The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Murders in the Rue Morgue.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.

No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.

You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?

You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.

He cut her up and dressed the wounds.

You knew I'd say yes.

As soon as this is over, I'm gone.

This painting...

It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.

Don't worry.  I don't wear it at the dinner table.

I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.

Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.

It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...

Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back.

As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...

If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...

It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.

You all right, sergeant?

You ain't goin'...

I didn't give any order to fire!

I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.

Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.

I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.

I say NO!

If there's anything I can do, sir...

But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?

My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.

Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?

Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.

Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.

Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...

All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...

Futterman?

<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!

That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...

Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...

Stay out here.

How? She's even forgot her own language!

Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...

I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.

She's not a little girl any more.

Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...

Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!

Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?

What kind of a horrible thing is that?

Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.

I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.

I miss Tommi so much.

Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?

Where have you been all day?

But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?

Where have you been?

It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?

Let me guess:  Another short circuit?

During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?

I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.

You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.

Hello.  Can I help you?

No, I've never seen him before.

What?

Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?

I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew...

Hammer?

Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?

Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.

WillWhere is Mercutio?

NedI knowI know

You are a gentleman.

Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.

Tomorrow.

What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.

There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?

Are you writing?

I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.

Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.

Words, words, wordsonce, I had the giftI could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstonesfor sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnerybut now

Interesting.

Most interesting.

And your relations?

I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.

Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.

God be praised!  Locked?

Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -

Where are you going?

I feel a scene coming on.

Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?

Romeo.

The show must  you know

I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.

Good luck with yours, Kit.

It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"

Not ready? Where is she?

God bless you!

Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.

He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.

He looks well enough for a mountebank.

My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.

I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.

But your voice  Have they dropped?

Can you love a fool?

I do not know how to undress a man.

Oh, let Henslowe wait.

There is time. It is still dark.

In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.

To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.

I love you, Will, beyond poetry.

The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.

You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.

I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.

No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.

Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.

Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .

I meanYour Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can

And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.

She loves me, Thomas!

No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?

What of her bosom?

I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?

But what of Lord Wessex?

"Poet?"

Is there a man?

There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?

Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.

What do you think?

I'm only asking what you think.

I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.

No.

You know what. Who's going to do it.

How much?

What? Yes, that's fine.

You looking for me?

It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.

Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.

For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.

No, can't think of anything else that matters.

Are you recording it?

I don't know them.

Parked outside?

Good. Well, you've seen the flat?

Cameron.

Did you know --

Aroused and inflamed.

Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.

So?

You want me to kick it open?

Don't.

No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?

Unfeasible.

Stop nagging.

Sshh.

Look over there. It's Cameron.

Cameron. You remember Cameron.

Well, you certainly had a good look around.

Will you calm down.

Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.

We have to talk.

You'll wait in the hall?

Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --

Interesting.

It's about the burglary.

Downstairs.

How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?

It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.

Eh, I don't know.

In this firm.

Hello.

Oh, him. Well, he died.

What do you do?

No.

Working nights?

October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five.

Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?

Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.

Your watch.

Anyway, you remember Harold?

I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.

You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?

-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --

Lester.

We cannot go into this later.

-- is that right?

-- is that what this is all about?

Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.

Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?

I know.

You're late, George.

I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...

What're you doing later?

All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.

She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?

You know what I'm talking about.

Like what?

Are you?

This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?

C'mon, are you or aren't you?

I asked you first.

I'd like to do your hair sometime.

... just, you could look very heavy...

Yeah.

No.

You are.

Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.

So you want to go in business for yourself?

After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.

You promised you'd do the show.

What!

You do it.

I'm sure.

You would?

Okay... but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?

... I don't get it done often.

George...

-- you are.

-- yeah.

-- ass and legs --

-- Jesus --

-- good afternoon --

Why?

You're going to kill me.

Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.

What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.

I don't know... Jackie?

-- Right after I sprayed her?

I'm busy, man.

Not yet.

Hi, George.

There were some shots.

Gunshots, there were some gunshots.

I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.

I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.

Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.

How are you, baby?

You're different.

Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...

George.

Hey, I'm, you know --

I already said hello.

No, but I think they might.

What do you want?

I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?

I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.

Television or movies?

What difference does it make?

I wish you'd go now.

-- yes.

George, now cut this out.

Yes, yes, I did.

George...

Said what!

But what?

Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.

George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?

When?

It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --

Well anyway...

This really ought to be layered...

That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.

Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say.

What about Jackie?



Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.

Yes.

My secretary saw you with that boy.

Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.

Does she know about us?

That's right.

Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.

We don't think marriage is important.

-- Yeah, honey...

I would say so, yes.

What?

-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.

-- Yesss?

Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.

What does he do? Is he an actor?

Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?

-- so when are you going to Egypt?

Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?

-- I'll get in the back --

Thank you.

You seem disappointed.

Do you have children?

Call me Les.

Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.

Dad?

Yes?

Dad?

Chocolate.

Yes.

Maybe he showed me something.

No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.

Room 237?

We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?

Yeah.

Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.

Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?

Red Rum.

Is Tony one of your animals?

No.

Shall we go into the living room?

It's okay, really.

That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.

Grady?

Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.

A nigger!

I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?

Beg pardon?

Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.

How are things going, Mr. Torrance?

Sure is.

Perfect for a child.

Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.

Eleven thirty - Jesus!

I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.

It's really nice up here, isn't it?

No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.

Jack!

I...

Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?

I just want to go back to my room.

Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!

Stop it!

Stay... stay away!

Have any trouble finding us?

Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.

The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are

Good.  Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.  Is your family having a look around?

This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.

What time does the plane leave?

If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?

Lowe's car-?

What's the money for?

Don't call me dear boy.

I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?

Thanks a million, Uncle Al!

After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.

I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.

I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.

You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!

I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again.  Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.

You know, I just might!

LET THY SPIRIT

But I'm fearful!

And I'm tearful!

So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about?

Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?

How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?

For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.

No... it's fine.

Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.

What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?

Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?

SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE

What is it, Mary?

Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.

Like this place?

Mary Clarence, are you with us?

What?

Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.

Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!

JUST SING!

It's after five.  We have to bathe.

Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!

She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.

We need experience.

Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?

Are you leaving us?

Run!  Take off!

I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING

Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!

You were unhappy?

The reason?

I see.

It has come to pass.

And all those like you.

How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"

But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!

Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.

A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.

What's wrong with my life?

This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.

Sometimes it's not enough!

It never solves anything.

I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!

You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.

And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.

A vote?

You sent for me?

Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days.

What?

But -- why?

From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.

So I don't shop.

And if I don't?

Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.

So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?

I have?

I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.

People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.

Where's who?

It's done?

I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.

Get her!

But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.

What's she doing?

Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.

Peace on Earth.

He's not like other guys.

Ice cream!

It's so beautiful...

Not a note.

Where?

Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.

Certainly not.

They spend two days in chains.

Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.

Why did you move the body, Doctor?

No bleeding.

He is a behemoth.

... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.

Wallowing quite literally in blood.

Maybe you should take this.

Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.

The Widow Windsor.

... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?

I manage fine alone.

The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.

Are you familiar with magnets?

I hear nothing.

What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?

What is it?

Climb up!

How are you?

You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?

Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.

Thank you.  No.  Here...

Why would you do such a thing?

Must I hear this?

What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?

What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?

I apologize if I worried you.

What are you doing?

What is so urgent?

Katrina...

The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.

I know you saw me.

Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...

Can you help?

Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.

She is guilty.

She has confessed.

There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold." Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too."  Get it? That's a goodun.

Thank ye.

They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.

Thank ye.

Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.

Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.

How 'bout you, Jerry.

Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.

Well, I guess it's all good.

These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.

My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?

Yeah.

We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?

Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.

Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 

Leave.

All right, y'all gonna go with me?

I want to watch T.V.

Stop it, Doyle!

Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!

What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.

Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.

You got that shit right.

I don't really understand the meaning of the words.

We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!

I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.

You believe in the Bible?

On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?

Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.

I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.

Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.

How come?

This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off?

They still around, your folks?

'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?

Maybe they needed it.

Where'd you get them flowers?

I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?

It's name's A Christmas Carol.

I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.

Oh, jackin' off?

I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.

A boy or girl?

I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.

I aim fer you to have 'em.

Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.

Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.

I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.

You all right, Mama?

Yes ma'am, I reckon.

These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?

A blister shore can hurt.

I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.

Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?

I'll be.

Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.

Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?

You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?

All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.

I don't think I've ever seen you before.

Do you have family here?

I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.

Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.

Okay.

Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.

Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.

Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.

I thought you'd be happy to leave.

My name's Jerry Woolridge.

You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?

Is he leaving right this minute?

Where will he go?

Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.

Yes.

It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.

Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--

And your father? Is he from New York?

Melville, huh?  It's been a while.

Not an easy book.

Jesus, what happened to you?

What happened?

It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.

I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.

Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?

And what about for you?

Do me a favor, will you?

They're all the same.

Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?

I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.

The kid's sorry, Auggie.

Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?

It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.

Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.

Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?

I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?

So. Are we ready?

I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.

What do you mean?

Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.

All right, sugar, what's on your mind?

Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?

Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?

That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.

So you're just going to give up and go home?

Still, you can't just write her off.

No you're not.

Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.

And you're giving it to me?

How long you been working for me, Auggie?

Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.

What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.

How'd you do out there, Jimmy?

That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.

They don't come cheap, son. These little honeys are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical climate, most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on. Little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage. The smooth, delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another...

It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.

Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.

Is your name Paul Benjamin?

I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.

His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?

Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?

I figured he had a right to know.

And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."

His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.

Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?

I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.

And have you mended them?

Well?

What are you talking about?

Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.

You still have that watch Auggie gave you?

Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.

I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.

Well, if you put it that way...

Of course. Where else?

People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.

I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?

My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.

Is that what you do? Draw pictures?

The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias. 

Three nights.

I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?

Where the hell do you think you're going?

I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?

You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?

Let's not get too idealistic.

Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.

His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.

I don't know.

So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.

Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.

You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.

I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?

Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...

I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.

I don't know.

With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...

Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity.

What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?

So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.

You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?

Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.

We discussed that.  And decided not to.

It's just Pearl Harbor.  People are a little crazy, right n...

Did you write that column?

They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.

And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.

So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.

...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.

Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.

<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.

Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...

As my wife testified, we were considering it.

Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion.  I didn't have a lawyer...

How long you have this detail?

You gonna climb that with one arm?

Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...

He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.

You think so?

What for, Sheriff?

You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.

Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...

Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.

You wouldn't even see it move.

How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?

In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?

So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...

Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.

Can I say something, here?

Are you absol...

I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.

Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?

Okay, doll.

Those idiot broads!  Here we are all packed to go to Miami, and what happens?  The saxophone runs off with a Bible salesman, and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant.  I ought to fire you, Bienstock.

Hi, Mary Lou - Rosella - Okay, Dolores, get a move on - How's your back, Olga?

Yes, Sue?  What is it?

You're welcome.

- so the one-legged jockey said - 

Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.

What happened?

But suppose it doesn't?

Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?

Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!

Yeah - where were you?

It did?  Boy, did it ever!

It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?

We didn't see anything -  - did we?

How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?

I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.

It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.

DAPHNE?

When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -

Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...

Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!

Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.

Good night, Daphne.

What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -

Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!

How can we?  We're broke.

Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.

You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?

Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.

Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?

Like when?

Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!

Hey - these are real diamonds.

Hello, my dearest darling.  So good to hear your voice again.

You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?

What'll I tell him?

Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -

Good night, Sugar.

It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -

And that's one of them.

I'm not that sick.

We better have a drink first.

Oh, I have some suntan lotion.

But there's one thing I envy you for.

Yeah - Josephine.

We don't have to run.

No!

I always did.

Brand new.

It's about the Florida job.

Yes, I'm holding on.

You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.

Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.

This is where I get off.

Daphne...

Why not?

It doesn't matter.

Anything today?

Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?

Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?

Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.

Well, here we are.

Then why did you take this job?

Men!

Brains aren't everything.

Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.

I want mine to wear glasses.

Why not?

Want to switch berths with me?

Are you staying at the hotel?

And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?

You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.

Why?

Josephine.

Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.

Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.

I seem to be out of gas.

My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?

Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.

What a beautiful fish.

Champagne?

You mean - like frigid?

Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?

My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!

Maybe if you saw a good doctor...

Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -

Would you do me a favor?

Really?

That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.

I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.

Tomorrow night?

I only wish there were something I could do for you.

Yes, they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this?

Oh.  The navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off.

What's the matter, Sugar?

You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -

Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.

A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.

We got different information.

You're wasting the taxpayers' money.

What's his first name?  And where does he live?

Thanks, Charlie.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Too bad, Charlie.  You would have had three eights.  Goodbye, Charlie!

God, Kat! Please. Dont be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.

I should get going.

Hey.

Fred Astaire and whats her face!

You know all that if these walls could talk stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?

If Ed ever found out....

Huh?

Moms refining her strategy for DDay.

I blame Tony Pee-Pants!

Whats going on with you two?

Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.

Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.

Whos ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?

Ill just check into a hotel.

Ah, a philosopher.

Crikey.

Hey, you!

You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?

What color are my shoes?

No, count it, anyway.

What?

Not you. Youre not disgusting. Youre lovely. Just the idea that theyd bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didnt...who never.... I mean, someones dead.

Your friend guaranteed my anonymity.

Would you grab my shampoo?

Are you asking me if Im gay for pay?

Dont stop asking questions, okay?

I swear. I dont have a signature move.

So youre telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? Thats a down payment on a Ford Focus!

But nothing did.

You have had girlfriends?

What would you do if you weren't an escort?

What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?

Besides, you hired me for my discretion.

Whats he do anyway?

You want I nut him in the boat?

Not yet...

Shes drunk. -er than me. But I didnt really dump you, did I?

What is it you do again?

They lived a long time ago -- before you and I were born.

Well, how did you like the class, David?

Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...

He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.

I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!

But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.

Can you swim?

Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!

It's cold, Daddy!

Yes, sir...

Well, looka here...

Do you think he's dead, Daddy?

Why, Daddy; you won't be here?

From Miss Johnson --

I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you!  We gon' get to be friends?

Mister, can you visit anybody here?

I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.

Who's winning, Mama?

What do they do in the white churches, Mama?

Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!

'Bye, Mama...

Can I go when the holiday comes?

Any sign of Sounder?

Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!

Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.

I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.

Well, let me have it.

Is he gon' be gone long?

I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.

We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.

How's the weather out there?

The most important thing is that you're home!  We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!

Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.

That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.

I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.

Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.

The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!

Good. Now 'Pillow'.

WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!

Dude!

<b>And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!</b>

Fuck that!  AGAGH!!

You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-

Ze alarms! Zey went off!

How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?

Dude, how can you hate the environment?

I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!

I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!

No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!

CARTMAN!

Mph rmpmh rm.

Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much...

Thank God, that sucked ass.

Viva la Resistance.

Yes I am!

I am Satan. I am your God, now.

Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!

What's the password?

So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?

Oh my God...

Dude, we don't have watches.

What's a butfor?

<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>

What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?

Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.

This is sweet!!

I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>

Wow, a lot of people showed up.

I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!

I'm needing lunch.

Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!

How is the children's progress?

What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?

What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!

You'd fuck your uncle!

Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!

It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!

You know I do.

What did you do today Satan?

Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!

Wendy?

Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?

Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...

Jesus, come on!

Weren't you down in the dining room?

And what are they doing now, Mac?

Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.

All too well, captain.

So, are you on for the next one?

You gotta think of your old age.

I think I can handle it.

The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?

Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.

I don't know what you're talking about!

Break it down to me, what's going on?

Look at this...Jesus.

No.  But it buys a lot of other things.

We're going to die.

What are we going to do?

Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?

I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?

And suppose you couldn't hold out?

Everyone just stay put.

Are you ready?

Yeah.  We did it.

I'm not going with you.

But how are you going to escape?

But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!

Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!

Sooner than later.

So close...

I'm fine.

I'm homesick.

We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.

Look around you baby, we're rubbing elbows with royalty, oil sheiks, this is class.  You'll be envied by everyone.

Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?

I'm looking for a man.

99 years, 241 days,  15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling. Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down.

Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.

You a mini-golfer?

Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?

I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.

Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.

Three whips. To go.

Hey, you still here?

How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?

Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 

She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho.

You look like you're something on the lanes.

It's a beautiful thing.

I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.

What do you think I can do?

Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?

It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.

It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.

Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?

We ain't married no more.

You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.

I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.

Son?

My poor baby!

He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.

Junior.

Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.

Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.

Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top. 

What if he wants to get out?

Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.

A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.

Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.

Leave him alone!

Like this?

He's not here.

What's your specialty?

Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.

Uh...over easy.

Can I ask you something personal?

Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?

I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.

Why were you suspended?

So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?

What's plan B?

What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?

Ha! And what do you have to do for him?

Come on Theo, what about plan C?

My mom told me not to stay in this town.

Come on, bargain with me.

Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?

I'm afraid you'll hurt him.

He's dead Sheila.

Where are you going?

If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.

Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.

Lane's closed big fellah, league night.

You guys got something going on downstairs?

You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.

You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.

Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.

... Your civil rights have been overridden!

Fletcher, get away from there...

Get out of there!

Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.

Direction's east coming!

We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.

But you've tested it?

What was that?

Norman, please!  Don't!

We're moving fast considering the storm.

What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?

Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?

See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.

Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.

They pressurize us with helium.

Picked up something?  What is it?

Don't get hysterical, Norman.

But sir --

I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.

You don't want to know.

You don't think weapons are important?

Edmunds?

You think he killed Edmunds?

Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.

Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?

I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.

Ted?  Captain?

Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.

You don't know that.

Who is that?  Where's that coming from?

Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.

A half a mile long?

Ted, get her away from the door.

Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.

But what does it do?  This... sphere.

Did you hear me, sir, because --

They switched us over.

Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?

Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?

Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?

Norman!

It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.

... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.

Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?

What?  Why...

What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --

Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.

Beth --

It's not worth the risk.

Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --

Maybe you should go.  To the sub.

None of this was here before.

No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.

You don't believe me.

He translated it wrong.

Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.

I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...

It's for motion sickness.

Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?

What's that?

It's like a sleeping pill?

Three to six hours.

Doesn't say.

It's an idea.

To be on the safe side.  I mean --

How do you feel about snakes?

You know what I mean.

Are you manifesting them?

Did you?

Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.

He can't manifest.

But --

That's when you went in the sphere.

Don't, Beth.

This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.

Beth!

Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.

Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.

What is that?  What are you doing?

I don't get it.

It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?

Then what is it?

Why are you looking at me like that?

They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.

Our answer.

I don't follow you.

I can't believe that, Harry.

I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.

Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?

Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?

Wisconsin's your answer.

Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.

We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.

It's the squid!  Stop it!

Missed.

You know how to work this thing?

What'd you say to him?

What does Norman already know?

Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.

Why would this ship carry instructions in English?

Meaning it didn't land in the water.

What'd you say?

No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?

Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.

You've heard of me?

Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.

You want me to try?

He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.

Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.

You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?

Has Harry spoken with Jerry?

Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --

There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.

Well, we'll see...

No, not anymore.

Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.

Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.

Who are you anyway?

You saw through me?

I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.

I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...

This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?

When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?

See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.

The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.

You're Starkiller?

Have you been checked out?

What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.

Who's the pilot?

Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.

This isn't going to work.

Get to the ship!

I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.

I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.

You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...

Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?

According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...

Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...

You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?

Are you safe?

You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.

Our love will grow, dear, year by year...

Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.

No, this hurts.

Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!

We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...

I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.

All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.

I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?

I'm all ears.

It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.

In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.

Or...?

Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?

WHERE IS IT ?

Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.

I'm not kidding. Marriage is -

I'm sorry, Carmen.

No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.

Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?

Isn't it great to be in love ?

None at all... We won.

He's nothing like you.

He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...

Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.

Do you mean it ?

You don't look very happy to see me.

Johnny...! I thought you were dead !

...I'm sorry.

I thought you were KIA, Johnny...

You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.

Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.

Good work, Number 1. You'll do.

This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!

What ?

You still gonna play for Brazil ?

Cover me.

What's that, Diz ?

Good good, then it's all settled.

No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.

Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !

I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.

The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?

Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...

Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?

Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.

You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !

We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.

Can you walk ?

Alright, we're gonna carry you...

All dead except one, sir.

Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?

Sergeant, secure the boat !

AAAAAAAAAAAA !

Where is Lt. Ilia?

Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?

The Creator is that which created V'ger.

<U>Why</U>...?!

To join, and become One with the Creator?

'To learn all that is learnable.'

That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.

We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...

You saved the ship.

That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.

The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!

Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.

We could have cut it off at the main computer...

Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.

That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 

Was he difficult?

'Commander' Decker?

Mr. Spock?

Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!

Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.

I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?

Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.

One hundred kilometers...

Viewer ahead.

Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!

Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...

We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...

Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...

Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.

Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.

We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.

We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.

Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!

Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?

What should you have known?

Child...!?

The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?

There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...

Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...

That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!

Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...

Then you'll be wet.

You're doing a <u>Play</u>...

Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.

You get what you pay for.

But, but but but...

Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...

Goodbye.

So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...

The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...

Really.  With the porch swing and everything...

I...I decided to give it another chhh...

But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?

Uh huh.

...lost the screw...

You like kids?

Fix my glasses.

Oh <u>okay</u>.

Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?

Ah.  Ah.  Ah...

...yes.

Because it's about <u>purity</u>...

Hi.

Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.

Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...

Press still works.

...and we could get up every morning...

To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.

Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.

What is it all about?

They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...

Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...

And I might have something important to tell you...

Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...

Hi!

It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...

Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.

Big day last night.

But, does it have to be an Old Mill?

He's on the ph...

Wat...

A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.

Yeah, but they never made a movie here.

...why am I here...?

I will.

What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.

Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...

Then she wasn't in the car.  <u>Say</u> it.

Bobby, don't say anything.

Isn't he...

What do you drink?

How old are you?

The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...

We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?

Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?

I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?

Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...

And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...

I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.

Nobody touched me, I was at home.

Get him on the phone.

I want you to hear this.

You can't do what?

What?

Wally...

And you know what...?

I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.

Hello.

I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...

Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?

I have to talk to you.

...he's the producer of the movie.

Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?

Oh, you're his attorney, too...?

What's in the case?

I'm looking for the writer.

My wife's going to have a baby.

We can't shoot in the Old Mill.

I...

I'm very sorry I...

My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...

I want to make a good film.

Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.

...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...

Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and I'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>.   And the best to Marion...  Where have <u>you</u> been?

What did you say to them...?

Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?

You cool the broad out?

Did you bring Bob's weights?

What's in all the bags?

<u>Stop</u>...

It's just a formality.

Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?

IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?

Mmm.

...we don't have thirteen at table...

Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to say that anything I could do...

On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.

I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...

...the damn thing...

You think so?

But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.

We have to lose the window.

Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.

So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?

<u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling. Use your words.

I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.

I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?

I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?

Like who?

I'm gonna call him.

I hope it's the right kind.

We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...

She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!

Actually.  I could only help him.

How many devilled eggs can you eat?

I don't want to say goodbye.

Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.

No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.

This is my house too!

Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.

Annabelle pick up the phone.

You think this is funny?

Help me here...

Uh.  What is it?

The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.

I hate her.  I really hate her.

No they're not.

You know, this horse smells really bad.

But you told us to starve.

Excuse me --

&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;

&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!

Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?

Poof!  You're happy now.

You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.

Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.

Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?

ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!

Where Ben?

Find the bird cage?

So what do you think we're gonna talk about?

The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.

Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.

Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...

People beat it, don't they?  All the time.

That's necessary, huh?

I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...

Planning on getting --

Something's up wi...

Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.

I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.

At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...

You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...

Still, please.

You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....

What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?

I need practice.

So why did y...

Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...

I'm sorry, I just...

You WHAT?

Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...

I don't, but...

She's devastated.

And you said...?

Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...

My advice to you?  Don't die.

That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...

Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.

You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.

See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.

Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...

Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...

You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...

Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...

Not yet.

Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?

Oh my God.  Are you serious?

It's just an assignment.

She's not gonna die.

I needed some time away.

I told her I loved her.

We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.

Where you goin'?

Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?

Hey.

Welcome to the show, Scooby.

And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?

When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?

Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?

How did they execute him?

Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.

But really, you never know.

So whaddya think?

I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.

This is definitely better.

This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.

I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?

Marty...

It's all about who you know.

What are you going to do?

Hi, Scooby! How was school today?

I can read it to you.

But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.

So you don't want to hear my new ending?

That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.

So? How was school today?

Get the hell outta here!

Come here, give me a hug!

Hello, Vi.

Yeah, um, then...are you alone?

Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?

Ni...

Who is this?

Oh, that's too bad.

That's too bad.

Oh? Anything I might have seen?

I do.

Yeah...So you're um...you're married?

Huh. Kids?

Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?

Pretty cool, Stanley.

Whoopee.

Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?

I said I'll lead.

I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.

Forget about it.

I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.

I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!

They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?

Well Filmore--

Are the labs in operation?

How's the arm?

I hope you don't mind all this--it's just that the networks will eat it up, you know...

I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...

And what exactly do they intend to do?

How goes the roll call?

Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.

Where the hell could they have gone!

Agreed--let's move it.

Drop the anchor!

Can I have a glass of water?

I have your word, Mister President?

Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.

But, finally, one factor tipped the scales. We received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one.

Yes?

Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.

Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?

Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.

Give that back to me.

Get a grip on yourself, Major!

What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?

Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.

You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!

They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.

What about the President?

I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.

Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.

Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.

Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?

Yes, sir.

Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?

Who do you think you're talking to?

What's the gun for, General Ripper?

That is correct, Major.

You know the regulations well, Major.

But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?

Suppose that were the case?

I'm trying to, sir.

But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?

But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?

And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.

Go on, Major.

Major, you're talking like one of them!

But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?

It was a honest mistake, sir.

I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.

Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?

General Jack D. Ripper, sir.

Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?

General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?

He says they've only shot down three planes.

General, stick to the point, please.

Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.

Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.

I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.

Roger, maintain.

He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.

I'm sorry, Major Kong.  I guess I was way out of line.

Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.

Primary arming switch.

So am I.

No kidding.

That's what I said.

What's your point, Lothar?

Release first safety.

Yes, Major.

No, look!  It's "OPE - Recall Mistake."

Then that settles it, doesn't it?

We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?

First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.

Who's that?

I'm okay.  What's up?

Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?

King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?

When they emerge, a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable, if they are moth-balled in advance.  I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years.

Um-hm.

Can I have some?

Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?

In Group?

How long were you in there?

You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?

Any gunshot victims?

You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?

But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?

I don't know. Later. I don't know.

No, no.

No, he's not with a girl.

Sure.

Yeah.

Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.

But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.

No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?

Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.

What?

She's dead?

Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!

Ah, you know people there?

Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?

Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.

Buff.

You better! Yes!

Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.

Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.

Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!

No, but I heard it was great.

So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?

I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...

You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."

You could do it.

Thanks, man!

Will you stand up for me?

Thinks he is. Well, he is.

Yes.

You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.

I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?

We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.

That's what I mean.

Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.

It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?

Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.

Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.

I'd love to read that.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.

It's coming along.

Wow, you're cute when you're angry.

Tim, what are you talking about?

To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.

What? What'd you do?

Well, w-what happened?

No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.

Yes.

Why? Because I give a shit?

No.

You know, this, what you're doing with your life...

Oh, it's very complicated, huh?

Nazeer what?

This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?

Oh! Trim it!

Was that supposed to be me?

Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.

Your sure as hell right about that.

Your completely missing the point.

No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.

Can I talk here? Let me talk.

Um, because you didn't want to go.

It got that close.

Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.

New ground?

No, I don't.

Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.

Mm-hm.

What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.

You're unbelievable.

Good, man.

Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?

Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.

The prom. That's funny.

So you think I should?

Really?

Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?

Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.

Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.

Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.

You do not!

Oh they'd never let me do what I want.

Would I get paid?

Yeah?

Yeah, come on, play it.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Yeah, I know what you're saying.

Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?

Where's Erica? You seen her?

Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.

You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?

No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.

What are you going to do? Hm?

Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?

Fuck.

Di, we're sorry.  We...

Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.

Diane?  Diane!

But, we have to make a smart plan!

I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.

So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.

Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.

I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!

...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  "Run to my voice - and don't look back."  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!

"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?

Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day...

Shut up.

She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.

... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?

Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie... I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School.

You got that big retarded girl down there?

Bank branch!

Your help.

I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.

I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.

Give me your coat.

Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?

Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?

Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.

This is Miss Kramer.

Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.

You forgot this.

There's one called....Window... something with a window.

Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.

Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.

Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --

Check.

Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...

Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.

It's just impossible.

You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.

Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.

I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.

That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?

Betty, there's no use running out on it.  Let's face it, what- ever it is.

Her own movie theatre.

I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?

All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?

Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?

Hello, young fellow.

Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.

What assistant?

Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.

Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.

I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.

Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.

I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.

They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!

I wrote that with my heart.

It's getting kind of late --

You'll like it here.

You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.

Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.

Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.

You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.

Not on the same floor with Valentino!

The other guests?

What are the notes?

What right? Do you want me to tell you?

Go away.

Did she read the script?

I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.

Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.

I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.

I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?

No, you're not.  Max! Max!

The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.

And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.

That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!

Some men are here.  They asked for you.

Whose room was this?

You send them.  Is that it, Max?

And she's turned you into a servant.

So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?

Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -

What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.

Madame is wanted on the telephone.

Paramount is calling.

It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.

What is the scene? Where am I?

I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.

I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.

It must be the girls. One of the girls.

Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?

A Storm Dragon?

Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.

Home?

Is this Nigel's doing?

Like it?

I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.

Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---

That makes it worse.

I'm not mad at you.

Hey! Ethan!

Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.

They think I have a concussion.

I know it.

Nurse!

You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.

You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?

You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?

Why the empty cage?

Hey, where you going?

I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.

Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?

Can I give you a lift?

Someone's chasing him.

Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?

I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!

I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.

It was my fault we lost the Power Source.

I'd rather not talk about it.

My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.

Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...

I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.

What can I do for you?

Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?

Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.

Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.

I just did. Because I have the Power.

Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.

What's it like?

Where is inner space?

I was on Earth...

...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."

You're going to take me back?

Zaltar. Use the wand!

Yeah? What do you want?

What are you talkin' about?

Mr. Roebush?

Not enough vodka in it.

I just can't stand this.

It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.

Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.

And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.

No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.

Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .

Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .

First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!

How many sugars?

Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?

Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.

I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...

Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!

Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!

Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.

Everything.

Can you do that?

Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.

You want to mess with Superman?

Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!

That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.

Thanks.  Let's go

You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

I know, by computers.

You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!

What terrific story?

Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?

Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.

It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.

I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!

Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?

That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????

Computers talk to other computers, right?

She's not his mama either.

Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---

Lois, what are you doing?

I don't?

I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.

I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...

Because of what I'm betting.  My life.

"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?

I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .

Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .

Hi.

Sleep well?

I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?

. . . Superman?. . . . .

Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?

A parka.

I like trees.

Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.

Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!

You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.

The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.

DELETE IN CUTTING

Where?

Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .

Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.

Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.

You said it. Three-to-one should get you 								both ears and the tail.

Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?

There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.

No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.

There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?

Look, they need a machine to fly.

He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .

They make my eyes itch.

You're late. Very late.

My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?

Oh . . . my . . .

Gee, I'm really sorry.

You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.

Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.

No Paris?

Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!

Well, I don't understand.

Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.

Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!

No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.

I think he's kind of cute.

This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.

What's that?

Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!

. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.

Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.

Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?

You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.

Hey! He looks . . . normal.

What was that about?

We'll all fry.

I am an experiment? I am freako?

Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.

Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?

You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.

But . . . how could you beat him?

It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --

You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.

Do you know where you're headed?

Are there any more at home like you?

Some people aren't the athletic type.

See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?

Stop him, Clark!

There weren't any wires. I looked.

Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.

Listen...thank you.

You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...

What are you doing here?

This??

So I've noticed.

Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?

What's the temperature now?

Mr. Romance...

Ready?

They stop for nothing.

I don't understand.

Oh. Why? does he live up here?

Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?

Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?

How come you get all the good stories, Lois?

Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.

The good lord works in mysterious ways.

All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.

Oh, dear. That isn't what I --

....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -

With my luck, now it'll rain.

Superman???

Do bullets really bounce off you?

There.

They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.

Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.

This is California. The richest, most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun.

Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --

It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --

I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?

And what does he do again?

We're...not together.

Yes...fine.

Then...when did she get better?

She's in trouble?

What...does it turn to?

I'm...so sorry.

I...don't think so.

I understand.

Case?

That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.

Hi, Nicole.

It just seems...kind of weird.

What do you mean 'outgrown it'?

Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.

If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.

Does this mean I can't take a shower?

Your kids never cry.

From what?

No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.

Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.

A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.

What do you mean?

I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.

Excuse me?

He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.

You hate it.

I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.

He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.

How was it?

Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?

That's right.

Yes.

I don't want you to lie.

Why?

What about Doreen?

Tell me about the Ottos.

They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.

Have they ever been busted?

You always think you're prepared for these things.

How old is she?

That's not news, Zoe.

I tested positive.

What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.

Do you have the blood test?

I can hear you breathing, Daddy.

I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.

I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand.  I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.

Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.

The Walkers spoke very highly of you.

Dolores?

Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?

Are you expensive?

If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.

No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.

Yes.

You are?

I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?

You could see the speedometer?

You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?

Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?

Why not?

There wasn't time?

What do you remember about the accident?

You're going to blow everyone away.

What's so funny?

What took so long?

What are you up to, Nicole?

What do you mean?

He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.

Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -

I still think he's responsible for the smear.

Joe, give my nephew a drink.

Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...

Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.

You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?

Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.

Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...

Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.

Not being partial, are you?

I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!

When I'm certain, I'll let you know...

Susie, I'm sorry if---

Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.

Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.

Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.

Can I come out?  No.

I know Manny Davis.

Match me, Sidney...

Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!

I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.

I'm not sure I can reach him in time.

Sidney, I told you -

Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth!

Avidly.  He was staring.

Do you think you could do something, Sidney?

Back?

Don't you know who that man is?

Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...

Who else phoned?

Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.

So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?

I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...

Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -

Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?

You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!

You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...

It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle...

Jimmy!  This is a coincidence.  I am just going -

I have a message for you; I love you.  May I dedicate the next number to you?...And the next, and the next. Every Sunday I'll buy you a new bonnet -

Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?

My God.

Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?

This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?

Yeah?  Who sent you?

Negative.  She is not a mission priority.

You have to do what I say?!

Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!

How long do you live?  I mean, last?

Affirmative.

Not even of dying?

You will.

"No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."

I'll deal with the police.

We don't have much time.

So she's pretty cool, huh?

I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.

Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.

I got it.  Piece of cake.

John, get out of the way!!

You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!

This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?

Can it be destroyed?

In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.

The CPU from the first terminator.

It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!

Where do you stand on all this?

That's because you had a proper upbringing.

What does he mean, too correct?

I guess so, sir.

I guess you admire musicians.

So, what does the Russki want?

So what is it?

What's that mean?

Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?

You have a question for Helmuth, David?

You bet.

Steve.

Major, Major... he's here ...

I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.

But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.

What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.

I made no deal!

Your guess is as good as mine.

Why were they going to arrest you?

Steve Arnold...

I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwängler, do you know Hans Hinkel?

Yes, I know who he is.

He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'

Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.

I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.

Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?

I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.

Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!

Do I know Hans Hinkel?

Major.

Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.

You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?

Was a member of...?  Speak up?

Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?

I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.

The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.

I've remembered something else...

Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwängler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwängler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.

Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwängler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwängler.

You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.

I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.

It was Beethoven's Ninth.

Can you handle it?

Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?

Do you understand?

There's so much...

--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines.

Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.

You volunteered?

Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight.

You'll learn.

Bag some Z's?

Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?

I don't think I like this.

I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?

I didn't build the fucking thing.

Why were the other two women killed?

...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...

Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?

Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.

Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.

Give me the short version.

Call her.

That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--

You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.

My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.

I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.

I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.

Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...

You don't talk to me like that.

Clean out your locker.

Oh, God... !

Alright... okay...

This is nuts.

Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...

I'm sorry, about this...

Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "

I'll give you a boost.

It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...

This is C.R.S.

You're the one who started running.

Where are we going?

A fresh shirt...

Didn't think I'd ever see you again.

Okay.

What is this!?

Then, what good are you?

That's a lie...

They did the same to him as they did to you.

What did you say?

What are you <u>doing</u> here?

Get us out of here...

What do you think you're doing?

It's mine...

No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?

What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!

No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me...

Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...

Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...

I have to get to the airport...

There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.

Originally, Connecticut.

Hey there, Nickie.

You need anything?

Really?

Will you?

Do it for YOU.

Yeah, almost...

No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!

You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!

Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...

How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.

I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.

We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.

Happy Birthday, Nicholas.

Oh... it's a game.

Sorry to keep you waiting.

It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.

Where?

Guess!

I've been so lonely.

Is everything alright?

I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?

Goodnight.  See you home.

What's this about?

He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...

The Hinchberger wedding.

What gentleman, Maria?

"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.

Attractive...

What's happened...

Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.

Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...

I only saw Theo drive up.

The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.

Because... well, I know I can trust you.

Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.

We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.

Yeah.

You used the wrong test.

Eleanor, how was the drive?

What is that tune?

I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.

The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.

No.

What'll happen to us, Nell?

Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.

Well this is a cozy breakfast.

She needs help.

Oh God, we can't get out!

Why do you need a chain like that?

Why?

They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?

What do you do?

You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?

If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.

I've never had a pedicure before.

You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?

I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.

Italian?

Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.

I like the colors.

I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.

The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.

How they goin', kid?

How'd you like to kill someone for me?

I mean, what has it been -- six months?

I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.

Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.

What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?

No.  Not at all.  Do we?

Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom.

Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?

Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?

Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.

I've been wondering something.

Same.

Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?

I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.

Had a feeling it was you.

Why did you come here?

When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.

When did you get in?

I might've been away for the weekend.

And you've seen Eddie Rama.

I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.

Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?

Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.

Who's Mr. Lindgren?

In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?

So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.

You don't believe it was a car accident.

Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.

What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.

I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.

Who remembers.

I don't believe it.

Not that I recall.

Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.

But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.

That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.

What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?

Yeah, that's right.

Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.

Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.

... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.

She's nice lookin'.

We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.

What's in it?

So why would he want to see you.

Hello there.

Exercising my visitation rights.

What kind of trouble are you in?

Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.

Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --

You must know Ian.

Yes?

Hello, Rachel.

That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.

...I wanted to make you happy.

...Mm.

Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?

Sure.

...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...

I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?

...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.

All right.

Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?

...Ed, I...

...You know... who *who* is?

That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.

Please, Ed.

I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.

Where you going?

'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.

Should I... should I tell you why?

Yeah.

...Probity.

I don't work here. My wife does.

...Did you make that up?

...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.

Jesus...

I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.

No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.

...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.

I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.

...We goin'?

Huh?

'Lo, Ed.

Mr...?

There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.

Looks like the curse is still at work.

Behind you.

That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.

Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.

Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.

You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?

What happened to them?

This place is a maze.

Dr. Green has to see you!

How much ammo do we have to make a stand?

What's that?

What does it say?

What's that doing here?

Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.

This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.

What is it?

Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.

"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."

What's that?

Something tried to get into this room!

This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!

You work here?

Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.

Quiet!

Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.

Stop!

There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?

Jesus, what is this?

For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?

Mbwun.

What do you make of it, Margo?

4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."

Is Dr. Frock safe!

If he were alive he'd have contacted me.

He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.

Pendergast?  Are you all right?

What happened?

It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?

For what?

Help someone!

He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.

When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?

Close up?

Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?

We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.

We're not watching the sea.

Cue music...

--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.

Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.

We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?

People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.

Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--

<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?

But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?

Sure she would.

You take Japanese.

Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.

I've got to talk to you.

I think it's got something to do with my dad.

I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.

It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.

Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?

What're we doing here, Truman?

That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.

Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?

Truman, what about that sign?

Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.

You got it.

They're coming.  Any minute.

--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."

Not supposed to talk about it.

Well, we're FBI agents.

I think that about does it, Spooky.

Why don't you go home to the old lady --

What am I doing here?

They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.

Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --

I need your clothes, Byers.

This man's still alive.

Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?

How's that?

You follow me out here for a reason?

Who sent you?

Those people were already dead.

See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.

What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.

What?

That would be my guess.

You told me you had answers.

You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.

I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.

Mulder...?

I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.

You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.

Scully...

They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.

They were the ones that put us together.

This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.

You're... quitting?

What are you implying, Scully?

Go home, Mulder. It's late.

Mulder -- what are you doing?

This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?

It's like jelly.

You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.

You think they went left?

Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?

That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.

Yeah, well they may this one.

Where'd they go?

What? What's wrong?

I have. I did. It's done.

What? What happened?

Scully...

...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.

Cold...

-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.

You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.

What is it?

But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.

Where is he?

The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.

We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.

Our vaccine may have no effect!

Did we go sailing?

He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.

It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.

Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.

Sing a song of sixpence.

Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...

...give a kiss to Edward.

This man is deeply disturbed, he...

What happened?

A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.

Wait...

I heard Julia and John got married.

He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.

Thank you.

She the one from Santa Cruz?

I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.

When did he lapse into the coma?

I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?

So?

The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.

Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.

Warscheinlich ist der murder.

Well, I saw you at the funeral.

You were in love with him, weren't you?

No.

Drink?

The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.

H-E-Z-T...

...and buried him.

Well, I didn't learn that from him.

What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?

A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.

...and my lover. He was Harry.

Are you going, too?

That's his headache.

Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?

You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?

In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.

I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.

What is it?

...Austrian Police Headquarters.

My name is Calloway.

Been here long?

Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.

Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"

"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.

Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.

Him dying like that.

Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?

That is the racket Harry Lime organized.

So would I.

...a week ago.

Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?

Do you mind if I drop off somewhere on the way? I've got an appointment, won't take five minutes...

Do you know his number?

You do!

Come upstairs a moment.

It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.

Seems exciting.

Hello - Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow.

Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.

Striptease, sir.

What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?

Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?

You really liked it?

Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.

Coffin?

Excuse me!

...Popescu...

Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.

Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.

Could he have been conscious?

There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.

I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.

Something wrong.

Mr. Martins...

Should I make it all fact?

Lime.  Harry Lime.

Excuse me.

What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?

Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.

Bonjour.

Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?

Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?

He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.

Bonsoir.

I think so too.

Exactly.

That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.

They only kill them when they love them?

Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.

Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.

Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?

Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?

What do you care?

This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.

The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.

How come so many of the books are in Spanish?

Are they still together?

You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?

Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.

Bigger and better.

See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.

The sex is better.

Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.

What's it about?

You're learning the Hebrew really fast.

Nazis talk about it all the time.

You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?

Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?

Why are you taking that?

They used to. Today it's not an issue.

Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.

Is it okay if I record this?

The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?

The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....

Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.

And? WHat did you notice?

Jewish girls like to give head, right?

Let's just say I've done due diligence.

Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...

How do you reconcile the two?

So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?

You shut up. Who do you think you are?

I don't do that.

Don't tell me what I --

Do you feel you're making progress here?

How have things been going?

Hello...?

Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --

Which one were you aiming at?

What is it?

I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.

Didn't you get anything?

Oh, what is this shit?

They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.

The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.

What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.

You missed on purpose.

Who's this?

Howard Stern.

Adam Sandler.

'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...

We tested the new bomb.

Oh, fuck you...

In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?

The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?

Maybe you should talk to him about it.

And you...?  Do you love Enzo?

You're leaving?

My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.

Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!

No!

You know each other?

I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?

Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.

The Mamma's there too.

Is it a poem?

Jacques!  Johana!

Checking out the competition.

What else is there?

A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?

Five minutes and fifty seconds.

Yes?

It isn't lit yet.

And where did you say you were from?

Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.

I dove 315 feet!

I remember.  Hi Roberto!

So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?

Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.

Your mother?

Why?

The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!

Can I come in?

... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!

You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?

Anybody can have a bad day!

... How long was I asleep?

No!  I would never cheat you.

You were right.

A drink to warm up?

Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?

I'd better get back now.

She's not like the others.  She can't stand to be away from the sea.

Then, tell me a story.

You sure?

Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 

And you?

Jacques...?

... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?

Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?

Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?

Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?

Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?

What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?

I changed the lock you son of a bitch!

... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales...  or are you still over your limit?

What is it honey... the frenchy?

... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment.

My dear, science is a cruel mistress.

Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?

Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.

It was a trap. I'm back at square one.

Looks like I got a plane to catch.

So. Do you have a name?

Oy vey, I'm stuffed.

Want to get a drink?

What was that!?

Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.

Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.

Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.

...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.

...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...

Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...

Anything else?

You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...

What's wrong with him?

What are you doing?

How do we bypass it?

What's your shpiel, Santa?

Bootleg copies of the Frank Capra classic, 'It's A Wonderful Life.'

I wasn't too over the top?

What day is it?

Is he in love with you?

Then what do you do?

Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.

I want him to lock me up.

And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --

Pedro is waiting for me, too.

Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't 

It doesn't jibe with this  you told me the leopard would go out into the country - it wouldn't stay in the city 

Why?

We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.

Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.

Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.

To the eye? Like other men.

Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?

Tormented -- ? Why?

Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?

Wait 

Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --

What are you getting at?

State hunters?

You won't go to Galbraith with me?

Get it out of here!

On his back, I suppose.

That's easy. Me.

On his back, I suppose.

Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.

I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --

Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --

Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.

No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.

We stood here once before.

It's a lovely town - it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.

By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistresss brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?

For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.

I found this at your brothers.

I will of course do my best to hang onto it.

Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.

You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.

Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?

Black suits you.

Whatever the reason, Im sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.

I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.

Your brother stumbled upon Adoniss little secret, didnt he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kids life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldnt be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? Leon does his own prints. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps its the way you say them...

Youre wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought hed wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I dont know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest...  I didnt know any of this before you left for Los Angeles.

I dont.

Is there anything to understand?

What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?

Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.

What do you suggest?

Directory enquiries. Can I help you?

Theres nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.

Im sorry, sir. Could you try that again?

The word for those things is croissants.

You wouldnt have a cigarette, would you?

Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?

You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?

There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?

Friedmans dead... They killed him...

No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...

Weve still got the Italian...

Why?

We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?

Where is the Austrian?

Where?

How many of you scumbags are here?

The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?

La collectionoose. Its about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. Its on TV tonight and as Im in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The directors supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?

Piss off!

What if it is?

Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?

I didnt mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.

My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.

Lets go.

Im overcome by your public-spiritedness.

Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. Youve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name hes using?

Trying to say something, Martin?

Its about the puppy. You got the money?

Fine...

Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You dont know Leon, do you?

What about which girlfriend?

Yeah. Why? Youre going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?

Okay, shitbag. Im only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?

I think youd rather not know what I think.

What you gonna do? Kill me?

Why, are you not ready to die for your king?

Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.

I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.

I thought you were an archer?

He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!

They've abandoned me... like everyone.

Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.

The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.

If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.

What did the king say?

It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!

Do as I say!

I am ready now...

My gentle Captain... I'm staying.

But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!

I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...

Go onto the next question.

Didn't you also carry a banner?

And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?

No, of course not... I never killed anyone...

No, I... I held it up to...

Yes, maybe... I don't remember...

W-w-what are you doing?!

My king will pay any ransom you ask.

Recite the Lord's Prayer.

I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!

Thanks be to God.

20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.

Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...

Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.

Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.

Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?

Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!

Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!

... as always, majesty...

When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?

It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.

May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?

Were you sent by Lord Dunois?

Good.  Where are the English?

Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...

My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!

The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!

Clear?

Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!

Do you know how to count?

But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?

Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!

But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!

I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...

Prepare these as battering-rams!

As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?

What are you doing out here?

I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...

Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!

Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?

No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!

Why would they?

God asked you to do something?

No.  That was a sword in a field.

No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?

Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!

I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...

I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...

You think you are ready now?

I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.

So... everything sounds... wonderful?

Who is this "he"?

Beautiful.

He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?

Only God knows the answer to that.

I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.

I want to be with him always...

Someone you know?

Who are you?

Dorota!

I need help.

What did I tell you?

To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.

For what? For my tie?

It's not going to be very comfortable.

Halina?

The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.

No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --

You know what we do? We use psychology.

It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?

No one thought they'd hold out so long.

Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.

Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.

No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.

You know what? You treat me like dirt!

No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.

You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?

What's your work?

Where are you hiding?

Watch your feet!

Careful! Watch his hand.

He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.

My REAL father was a famous German composer

Ohhh I've never been there. 

One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.

Well, that is a strong opinion.

I worry for you.

What's he say?

Those 80 acres, that cross the stream, what do you think of them?

Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?

Yes, why not.

I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...

Please take us to the beach where we landed.

What?

She wants it to come.

We can't leave the piano

What on?

And when is the next lesson?

Play a gig.

Which way are the rooms?

What are ya gonna do, call the cops?

You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.

Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.

How 'bout a handkerchief?

Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store.  I need a twenty man boost right away.

How much did ya lose?

You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.

We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.

You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?

We cleared 22 here.

Wasn't no problem a mine.

He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.

All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.

We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.

Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.

Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.

No signs of trouble?

How 'bout Lonnegan?

And?

You think he'll show?

You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?

You wanta wait for your share?

All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.

How ya doin'?

See and raise five.

Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.

A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.

How do I know you're tellin' the truth.

My end was only one.

Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.

We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?

Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.

Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.

You doin' anything tonight?

You got a back door to this place?

All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.

I don't even know you.

Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.

I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.

Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?

You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.

You stayin' in or not?

What happened to your face?

You got nothin' on me.

I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.

We were getting 50 from our guy.

Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.

All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?

You weren't hired to miss him.

I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?

This is the last time I expect to see you down here.

What is this?  I got work to do.

Do ya know him or don't ya?

Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.

He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.

Why not?

Cheer up, darling.

What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?

Any luck?

She's got me worrying, too.

Why did that man want to kill him?

What?

I can't help it.  You don't know.....

You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.

How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?

You took that money from Julia's hand.

Then what are you hiding?

How are you?  Here.  Get under this.

Aren't you Nick Charles?

Not that scrawny little....? 

That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!

You heard about Julia Wolf?

There. 

She fell down.

I don't know.

It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.

Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.

Poor Dad, does that still bother you?

But it isn't bad weather now.

What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?

That woman!

I never saw him before.

Ask him.  I don't know.

This gun yours?

You've been there?

For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.

I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?

He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.

Shut up.

I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.

About three.

I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....

I didn't know they had a fight.

You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?

She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.

That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.

You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?

Don't mind what she says, Chris.

Why, you said...

Who's that man?

No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.

Oh, he's sitting up.

Well, let me do that for you.

You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.

It might.

Where's Gilbert?

This is all very pleasant but why are here?

You did... where?

Oh, did he?  What did he say?

Nobody told me.  I did see him!

All right - you didn't.

That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.

Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?

You got types?

What hit me?

Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.

Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --

Isn't that my drink?

What are you going to do with it?

Everybody says you were a grand detective.

I'd like to see you work.

She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?

But it's Christmas now.

You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.

I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.

Aren't you hot in that?

Did I give it to you?

Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!

What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?

Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.

You mean, he might be hiding there?

I want you to stay and find Wynant.

What do you mean?

But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...

Who do you think did it?

Is that true?

You worked here?

Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?

You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.

I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?

That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.

Bonds, sir?

I just wanted to tell you...

Where are you going?

Home?

Who fired you?

What's it say?

It's a map, I think that's what it is.

They shouldn't have been here.

What are you doing.

You two fighting's not going to get us anything.

Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.

He's not so--

Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.

All right.  Let's get out of here.

All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.

You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.

What happened?

Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.

We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--

I'm the one's got the big stick.

So you can give us away?

Give it to me!

Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.

I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.

Take the binoculars.

You can't tell anybody about this.

I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.

There's a way.

You're going to be fine.

This.  Whatever it is.

I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?

Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.

Where the hell is it!?

Think there might be more Iraqis?

It looks like you're not doing anything.

Wait.

We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.

They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.

And you; you've got it all together.

I'm sorry about that, Epps.

I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.

Sorry.

We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.

You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.

I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.

What do you figure it is?

Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?

Oh, God...

Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!

An Iraqi?

What do you make of them?

...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.

We can't just sit here waiting to die.

Damn it.  We lost the horses.

It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.

Well?

How do we do that?

I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.

I'm thinking about taking a trip.

Australia.

We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.

When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?

Spanish wasn't hard enough?

It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.

Jaeger?

You ever think about dying?

The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.

We...we could go home with something else.

It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.

God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.

Epps, is that a sand dune.

Iraqis.

I thought we were dead.

Epps...

How long we going to keep this up.

So?

We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.

Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.

What do you think?

I can't hear him.

Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.

Control ON.

You know I don't feel well.

What did you get?

Now?

I don't know.

Then why did you bring it up?

Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.

I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.

What time is it?

What are you doing?

Are you all right?

They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it.

They're watching us now.

no...no, no.

We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...

I've got it!  Astounding!

I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 

You're in violation.

I'm leaving.

What?

This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....

I knew him.

....with me?  What am I to her or she to me?  Nothing.  She's an ordinary roommate.  I..I share...

...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...

They're not here.

f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-

Alright, let's check it out.

What was-? Why...?

Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.

Right.

So cut both.

How long were you hooked?

It's working.

How do you know?

Good, now the other side.

Keep talking.

Wires... metal, cold... something soft...

More metal... sharp edge...

Something round, two wires ...

What... ?

What do you think?

Right.

Lane oil...

Cover.  It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.

You okay?

You touch me again and--

Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...

How're you guys doing?

Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.

What's this?

Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-

Yes.

on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.

Why did you let this man in, M'sieu Filiba?

<u>Tonsili!</u>

Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.

No.

No color, no sparkle--but dependable.

Yes, Baron.

I would start with cocktails.

I want to see that moon in the champagne.

You can trust me.

Two weeks and three days.

And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.

Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!

Thank you, Major. 

Who?

The tennis player?

Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?

Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.

Right.

Two fifty-three, five--

<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.

Éysée seven, eight, nine, two.  We have to clear out.  Railroad station? Ticket office, please.

You <u>have</u> to get out of here!

Don't you <u>realize</u>--

And you--

Then you go to the left. There's a landing.

Then you go into the foyer.

Neither do I.  That's where I found it.

One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 

Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--

You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.

That's too dark.

Make it out to cash!

I see.  She must have been very happy here.

Crimson!

No--yours, madame.

Like that!

I'm crazy about you!

You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.

Oh, M'sieu Laval ...

Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?

But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?

Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...

Yes, madame?

Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?

I beg your pardon!

Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.

I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.

You're certain?

I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.

Who's the best? Say it.

She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.

We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...

Holy shit.

Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.

She's not on the starboard side either.

Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.

Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?

Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.

Something serious has happened.

Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.

Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?

Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!

You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.

Cor... look at that, would ya.

Oy, mate... that was a close shave.

You're distracting me. Go away.

The fall alone would kill you.

I'm Jack Dawson.

So, you got a name by the way?

Mr. Dawson, I --

I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!

So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.

What's this?

You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.

And...?

I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.

I don't know the steps.

You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.

You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.

I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.

Are you nervous?

You're trembling.

Now it's worse.

So... how did you find out I didn't do it?

Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.

Yes sir.

April 14, 1912.

Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.

Anya!

Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?

When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.

But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.

Oh--a hundred times--

Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.

You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--

Did you find it?

We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?

Aces full.

You're coming back--

How about a little game later?

Could I see you a minute?

I thought you were one of my friends.

Where have you been hiding?

How about giving me another coat?

This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.

Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?

Isn't she attractive?

Sooner it you like.

What are you thinking?

--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.

What?--

That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--

Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.

Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.

This is a business trip!

Shortie!--you know my motto?

Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.

Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.

Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.

That goes two ways.

Before that. Your face is very familiar.

If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--

You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.

That's too bad.

Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?

Your wife knows that, don't she?

Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."

Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!

I'll say--how fast is this boat going?

Hello, Denby!

He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.

Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?

I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?

Am I a member of this club?

Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.

Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--

And you've put it over--haven't you?

You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?

Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?

I don't get the humor of that remark.

I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.

But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?

Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!

Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.

Well, he has a straw hat--

Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.

Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--

What for?

All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.

Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--

I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--

It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!

Congratulations.

I mean if you knew it were stolen.

Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.

I was in his cabin--

God damn son of a...

Where'd you get that horse?

I want them spitting blood!

Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.

Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.

Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?

I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.

Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.

All right, lunger.  Let's do it.

Very cosmopolitan.

Very instructive

I don't know.  Probably ignore her.

I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.

Satisfied?

So what does he want?

When will you wake up?  You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.

Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".

You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!

Don't touch me!

Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!

See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.

Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?

Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?

Doesn't suit you.

See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.

What's wrong?

And I don't even know your full name.

You feel bad about this?  About me?

You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.

Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.

Look, Mattie, I know you're-

Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us.

Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.

No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin' I say'll fix things but I want You to know it wasn't me.

Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.

I don't like it.

Boy, look at all those stars.  Bet You can see every star there is. Practical touch 'em.  Kinda makes You think, you know?  I mean you Look up and you think God made All that but he still remembered To make a little speck like me. Kinda flattering really.  Hey, Wyatt, you believe in God?  No, Come on, really, do you?

Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.

Hey Doc!  Come on now.

Yeah?

Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. Clanton came in an hour ago, they Switched over to poker.  Tried to Get him to bed but he just won't Let go.

That thunder's sure somethin'.

What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.

Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?

You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?

Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!

Look at that.  Busted.  Brand new Money Ward, too.  33 years old And I don't even have a decent Watch.  'Bout time I started Lookin' out for myself.

Look pretty rough.

You'll never make that stick.

Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -

Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.

Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'

What - no lust for adventure?

Q! How are you?

I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -

Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.

Oh, James. I've missed you -

What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?

Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?

There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.

I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.

She married a hockey player.

Can you arrange a meeting?

Interesting presentation.

... Does this do anything?

Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.

I hope you'll be gentle.

Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.

Not a lot of difference.

Another reason??? Did I miss something???

Come in, 007. You know the Minister?

- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -

... What's Harmsway done?

The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.

...I'll give you a ring from Venice.

...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.

And what do you call these? The Gang of Two?

I was just getting to the interesting part!

Who's in charge here?

You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.

What's your name?

I was an attorney!

You won't get away with this!

And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.

Damn. It's doing it again.

Obviously, the British government denies all of this -

He brought that up from the wreck.

Is the helicopter ready?

Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.

Will it go off?

I pay my own way.

When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?

Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?

Why don't you come in for a while?

We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.

Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?

Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?

You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.

Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.

He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.

Well, it's up to Suzie.

You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.

Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.

I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.

He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...

Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.

You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.

One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.

I have someone I want you to meet.

I hope that it's nothing serious.

That smells like fresh coffee.

Good afternoon, ladies.

As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.

Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...

A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.

I don't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times.

Some people grow up and change their ways.

You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."

I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.

An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.

Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.

I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.

When did you talk to Harry?

Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.

You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.

How are you?

But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.

Everybody say, "Bye, house."

Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.

Oh, hey - it was nothing.

Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?

What are you doing over there?

Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.

He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --

Oh.  Oh, that's good.

According to my nava-computer, the --

Sheriff, this is no time to panic.

It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --

Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.

Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.

Woody!  It's the moving van.

Great!

It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.

Hey, watch it!

B-3.

Hey!!

Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!

MOM!!  MOM!!

Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?

Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?

That ain't no happy child.

Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...

You are a liar!

No!  No, no, no, no!

No, it's not what you think, I swear!

Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.

If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?

Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.

Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.

Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?

I like plaits.

Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.

But then I had a brother and a sister left.

You're well built; how old are you?

I appreciate you coming in so early.

No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.

He's not here.

I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.

How much do I pay him?

This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.

Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.

That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.

Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.

Helena --

It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?

You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.

Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.

You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.

What's up?

Live with your parents?

How are your grades?

You do?  What else you do?

Inhale the smoke and hold it.

Yes, mom --

No telltales.  Nothing to read. Not touching my face.  Not even blinking.  No giveaways.  How're you feeling?

Chill out --

She knows Arnie Metzger.

You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.

Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.

Arizona.

All the professionals keep them in the trunk.

I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.

So, it's worth the wait, right? What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have an airlift?  It's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right?  How many peasants would that take?  A line stretching from here to Mexico City --

You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.

You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.

I don't think you're going to do that.

There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.

Javi!  Come on.  Don't pull this you don't care bullshit.  This is incredible information.  It must be. Javi --

Somewhere safe.

What's your name?

I'm curious how you did this with such economy.

I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.

The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.

I don't give a fuck about your parents --

I don't know, maybe we missed her.

Well, I've not brought them.

Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.

I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.

Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement.

This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.

Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.

Where are you going, Diane?

Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.

Sorry.

What?

Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.

Well, it isn't.

Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.

What happened?

No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.

Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.

Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.

There's no need.

No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.

Are you getting out much?

Thanks, Mark.

Good luck, Spud.

A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.

I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?

Who wrote it?

Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -

I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have.

Oh no, don't even mention it.

God, you're sick.

Cut it out.

Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.

I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?

Why?

The Sick Boy method.

No, I don't think so.

What's on the menu this evening?

Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.

No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.

Sounds great, Swanney.

If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.

There.

It's the great outdoors.

How's it going with Gail?

We go for a walk.

Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?

It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.

No, no, it's not possible.

Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.

New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?

This is the Starship Enterprise.

This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.

You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.

No, but you can bet they will.

Where did you get this power?

Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.

Captain, we can't trust anyone now.

Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?

Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.

Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.

And that is?

Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.

Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.

Goodnight, Spock.

I could use a shower.

What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.

Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?

But he does seem familiar?

Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.

Damnit, Spock. God damnit!

I ordered you to defend this ship.

There, you see? See?

This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?

Spock?

Spock, I thought I was going to die.

I must have your starship.

No! No reply. Remain on course.

Spock...  What have you done to my friends?



No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.

I am a Starfleet Officer.

Each man's pain is unique.

I don't understand...

Sybok.

Are you embezzling?

Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn  is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called...  ...Space Paranoids.

Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.

Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...

Did you say Group 7 access?

Did he say why?

For what?

Beautiful!

They'll start to soon enough.

No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.

This town's full o' live ones.

Yes?

Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.

Alan!

How about over there...that empty memory?

Flynn...  Where's Ram?

But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...

Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?

Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...

What's goin' on?

Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.

I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.

Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..

you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?

But-what if I can't...?

Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.

Yori... hey...

What is it?

Helen!  It's your mystery man.

That's not true, honey--

Dana, are you listening to me?

You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?

There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.

You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?

Dad, how come you know the words?

Uh huh.  Right here in river city.

Immediate roll.  Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.					* Vehicle is red-and-white						* convertible.  You have six minutes.

So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!

Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.

Fourteen, Harry.

Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.

What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.

Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --

So, you wanna play huh?  You little--

He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.

Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.

Nobody believes it can happen to them.

Guy's a spook!

Give me the page.

She's still at my house.						*

--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--

He's got it.

Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?

Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.

I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.

Look, I know you're upset.  I'm really sorry, honey.  I raced home as quick--

I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.

You weren't attracted to him at all?

Would you say he was boring, then?

And you agreed?

My husband can't know about this.

Now slide the nylons off one by one.

Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--

It makes you tell the truth?

I don't take those assignments.

No.  But I wanted to.

Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet.  But it's not enough.  If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.

Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.

Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.

But with you, she gets to be hot, right?

See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?

I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?

Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?

Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.

Are you sure you weren't followed?

Tell me what happened?

Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.

It's a good thing you pay me well.

How?

Holy Mary, Mother of God.

I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.

Tell him we gotta go.

Has he looked through it yet?

Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?

The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.

Sonny kicks ass.

I don't remember.

I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.

Do you get paid a lot?

God, Spiderman looks different.

Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.

She OD'd, didn't she?

Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?

You're a whore?

What did he do to Arlene?

Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?

Sweetheart, write down your former address.

I think what you did was...

Do you want some wine, sweetheart?

I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?

Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.

Live with what?

Yeah.

I can't believe what you're tellin' me.

Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".

You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?

Who the fuck are you?

Wannabee nigger...

Clarence?

Money problems?

How much of that letter was on the up and up?

It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!

I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?

What's this acting class guy's name?

OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.

Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.

Clarence...

No. But thanks.

I'd fuck Elvis.

When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.

So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -

Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -

Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.

Well, I guess it's about that time.

I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.

Oh, Mr. Donowitz -

If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?

Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?

Yes, I still have friends on the force.

They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.

I don't believe you.

Oh, don't bother. I got one.  So you're a Sicilian, huh?

It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.

Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.

If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?

Could we try it now?

That Vietnam movie?

Do you believe him?

Or a bit player -

And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.

You do more than try.

He saw the wire.

Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.

You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be crazy.  I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.  He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?

Naw man, that's some serious shit.

Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -

You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?

You gotta hold this for me.

Just put it in your purse.

No.

We want you to tell us about last night.

Wake up, Cole.

No, sir!

Well?

Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.

San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.

What kind of information?

Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?

Do you know what year it is?

It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.

You used to call me "James".

You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.

No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.

My notes.  Observations.  Clues.

Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!

I told you what I want.  Lock the door!

The guy was a total fruitcake.

We need gas.

I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.

Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.

I don't understand what we're doing.

James, you said he was hiding in the barn...

What does this mean to you?

No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.

I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.

Why are we doing this?

So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?

We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?

Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!

I mashed the spider, didn't I?

He was fully sedated!

Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?

Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...

No, thank you.

Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.

Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?

I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?

I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.

You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.

No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.

Any parting words of wisdom?

Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.

Can I help you, sir?

You own this place?

Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?

I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?

Yeah, but it was shot.

Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!

Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.

Let me get your change.

That yours, Mrs. McKenna?

I put up new drapes, Jake.

What's the matter?

How could I?  I was sleeping.

My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.

Jesus.

I got it.

It's nothing.  Really.

That a fact?

You're not from around here, are you?

I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.

Nice place you got here.

Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.

I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.

That's not an answer.  What is it you want?

Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.

Doesn't the heat bother you?

And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.

Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.

How far is it to California?

Take me with you.

Jake.

Lied?  What do you mean?

It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.

Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!

There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.

If you want.

To get my car.

John . . .?

Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.

One-hundred-thousand dollars.  A little more.

Is that the kind of girl you think I am?  What can I do to make you relax?

Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.

John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?

It's . . . it's locked.

Someone will find me.

Husband . . .?

I have half a mind to--

Hey!

She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women.

Talk?  About what?

Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.

Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.

I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?

Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--

I came for Grace.

I came to kill her.

It's the truth, Jake.

This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.

What are you babbling about?

You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.

Two-hundred dollars.

What happened to your hand?

You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.

Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?

But you was going to fight for me.

He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.

You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.

Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.

Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.

That's a shame, John.  A real shame.

Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.

Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.

Do you understand me you little fuck?

Kids.

He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.

There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.

That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.

Why don't you step out of the car, son?

What'd you think, boy?  That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to?  Not by a long shot.  You're just the most gullible.  How much did you get?

Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?

Oh, Jesus.

Hell no!

Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.

You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.

I wasn't doing anything.

Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.

Mexico?  You going to Mexico?

After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.

Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?

Wait a second--

What can I do for you, lad?

You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.

Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.

Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.

Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.

If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.

Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?

...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.

No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!

What happened to your hand?

Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.

Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?

Just banged my head.  It was an accident.

What the hell happened to my car?

Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?

Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.

You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...

One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?

You think bad, and bad is what you get.

Two-hundred.

Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.

Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.

What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want?

I call the sheriff.

That's right on my way.

Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.

Accident.

That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.

Where'd you learn to do that?

A medicine man?

I think I can find my own way back to into town.

Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...

Doesn't the isolation bother you?

You'd never understand.

After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...

Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.

Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...

What do you mean?

What about us?

Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 

The money's right here! Get the key!

I can't see it.

I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.

What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?

Why?

When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.

Hope is a four-letter word.

I busted my leg!

There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.

"Arkady"

...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.

Yeah, if you could send it care of...

I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.

Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.

Heineken?

Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25.  You try to have a nice day now, would you?

Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.

Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!

Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.

How old is Jeb?

When was the last time I wore pink?

I've come to a decision.

Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?

What do I do when I'm around someone I know?

Would you like to try going--

He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.

...I think rust.

I'm not sure.

What about the game?

You've never been sick?

I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.

Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.

I don't know what you're asking?

Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--

Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.

I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.

Are you finished?

He's doing well today.

Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?

I think it's be better if I was alone.

Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.

How many did you put on that time?

I know now.

I'll just shoot him once.

Was your family traveling with you?

Twelve years.

How so?

There have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years. I've followed each one of them... A Seven-three-seven crashes on take off. One hundred and seventy-two die. No survivors... A hotel fire downtown. Two hundred and eleven die. No survivors... And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city. One hundred and thirty one die. One survivor. He is unharmed.  I've spoken with your husband about his survival. I suggested a rather unbelievable explanation. Since then, I've come to believe, that my explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true.

No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.

...I got a present for you.

I didn't think they'd really do it.

We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.

He give 'em names?

Mmmm pistols.

We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...

Uh... a little, maybe.

This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.

She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.

Yeah?

An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?

I could run off them whores.

Like I said, I...

I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.

There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.

I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.

You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?

That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?

I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...

But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...

But... if he doesn't miss?

Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.

Ned's share?

You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...

I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.

Been gone near three years now.

Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.

Three ways, I figured.

Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?

Finish him, Ned.

When we gonna double back?

You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...

Yeah, he's in there.

Did... you... get... him?

Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.

It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...

This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.

I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.

P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.

I was lucky in the order.  I always been lucky killin' folks.

How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?

Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.

Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?

Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that.  A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all. 

Some fucker's shootin' at us.

You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?

Easy, Bill.

Who's he?

Hullo, paw.

That fella come by... Tom.

All that money... I mean... did you...?

N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...

Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...

Far enough.

Fuck you.

Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.

He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?

Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?

We done that stuff.

That ain't what I mean.

I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.

I don't get it.

&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;

Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.

They want more time to think about investing.

Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -

I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.

How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.

You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.

Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.

Roger really. People say I talk too much.

They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.

You have to come.

They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.

No killing?

What-are they speaking?

What if I

with what?

My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.

Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.

Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.

What did you say?

We're on vacation.

I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.

Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.

A little of both.

I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.

I'11 find him.

No, no, no, no, no.

That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.

Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.

Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.

You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?

You know Ruby is in Attica?

Came from Redfoot.

Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.

You're stalling, Verbal.

I wanted to. I thought we could make it.

TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .

I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.

But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.

Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'

NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?

And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?

I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?

That was our insurance company's recommendation.

What are you doing here?

... he wants to testify ...?

You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?

Thank you.  When Debby...

...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.

Ed Concannon.

Objection, we've...

...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?

Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?

How is that?

...of Anesthesiology?

How old are you?

Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...

Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.

Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?

Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?

They lied.

I do.  Yes.

What is this going to cost?

If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.

She getting good care over there?

Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?

I didn't do too well for you.

You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.

...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?

I read the hospital report on your client.

I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...

Yessir.  I'm sorry.

I had a witness disappear on me.

Is the Plaintiff ready?

I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out...They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case.  Now this is it today.

Galvin, look, many years ago...

Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...

I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...

This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?

D'you find an apartment?

A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?

My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.

Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.

Do you think it's my fault?

You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...

What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...

What are you going to do?

Thank you.

Uh ...

Sally Doneghy, now who is that?

... hey, I don't need your charity ...

You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?

We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.

Brindisi versus Electric Boat.

What I'm saying, they're getting some help.

John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.

What happened, Joey...?

Yeah?  How's our new witness?

`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'

She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'

We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?

... I'm sure you do ...

Yes.  Yes, I have.

... I understand ...

He saw her at the Northern Care...

I spoke to her, and everything is all right.

I just saw her.

What?

A single hour.

I want to buy you a drink.

It's a long road that has no turning.

You have a record of what happened in the operating room...

Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...

Yes.

A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?

...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.

That Frank was working on.  Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror.  So Franky finds out.  He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint.  I told him ' Franky, wake up.  These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from?  Doing good?'  He can't be comforted.  He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.

Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?

And you like it.

Like all this.

I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?

I didn't mean to be that rough.

Ernie's.

He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.

Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --

Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.

As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?

But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.

You want me to dress like her?

The color of your hair...

Where shall we go for dinner?

I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?

I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.

No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.

You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.

We're going up the tower.

Dead. He'd broken her neck.

I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --

Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?

Love me... keep me safe...

...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!

When?

Please drink your coffee.

You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?

Do you know where you're going?

When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.

No, I can't tell you!

What do you remember?

What else?

How do you know?

No, don't go away!

Yes --

Tell me.

Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!

Yes.

Why?

Where?

Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.

Her car is gone.

I had to quit, Midge.

From that music.

It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.

Well?

Aren't you ever going to get married?

Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?

Could be.

Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 

My... the acrophobia.

I think I can lick it.

Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.

Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.

Pop Leibel.

For bringing you here. Come on, tell!

I've told you enough.

Out. I've got things to do.

What was this desperate urge to see me?

As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.

It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.

Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment.

I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.

We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.

No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.

No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.

Oh, and why am I an asshole?

Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...

What did you say?

Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.

What do you think you are doing?

Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?

Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!

You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.

Sun rises at 5:52.

How do you figure?

We have to get going.

Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.

Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!

Fuck you Boyd!

I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!

Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.

Where's the candy?

I want you to hear me out.

Have you thought about what I said?

Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.

Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?

What?

But not tonight.

Where do you look? What side of the neck?

Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.

She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.

What kind of words?

OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.

Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.

This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.

Whatever you say Kojak.

Your ideas never work out.

I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.

A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?

We're goosed.

Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.

Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.

Are we supposed to?

May we have the rings please?

Why can't we do it through the mail?

Florist?

Why?

They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.

I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.

It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.

You expect more what?

Time out.

I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.

Keith do not trivialize this.

Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.

Do you love me?

Will you please call the chair people?

Go have fun. Not too much.

Where are you?

Yeah. Sure.

Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.

No way.

I know.

It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.

Don't even.

Who's dead?

You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?

No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.

I told Boyd two fucking minutes!

He kept saying he was protected.

I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.

I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...

Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.

It means she's insecure.

I don't care for him.

Where did you get that?

Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".

I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.

You alright?

Pup corn?

I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.

We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.

"You Send Me."

...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile...

No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.

Take me there.

Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.

Was that difficult to get?

You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.

My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.

Yes, it is.

You must think I'm mad.

If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.

Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.

Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.

Leave me now. You can go to bed.

The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.

It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.

My God, what have you done to him!

Why the bad temper?

Kill him.

I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.

What do you know about me?

I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.

What are you doing here? Get out.

Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.

Yes. Why?

They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.

You'll soon find out, you liar!

How do you do, Miss Viridiana!

Why are you crying?

He came in through the cupboard.

I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.

You have decided to leave, Moncho.

Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?

Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.

How do you feel?

Have I slept long?

Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.

Sid 6.7 is now armed.

Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.

I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.

There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.

Barnes, where the hell have you been?!

Enough to level an entire city block.

This better not be a wild goose chase.

Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.

Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.

It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.

Don't be angry with me, Daryl.

All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!

It was you, wasn't it?

SID  NO!!!

You actually listen to all those tapes?

John died.

If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.

Go to hell.

Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.

He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.

Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done.

Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?

You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?

What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.

What does that mean?

Don't worry about it, all right?

Don't get out of the car.

Which way?

We know you didn't kill those guards.

He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.

You're not capable of it.

The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?

Where the hell are you going?

Then shoot him already.

The symphony of collision...

I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you

What C-4...was Cox talking about?

You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!

To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.

Do they have to look so...robotic?

You want some research, flu?  Side-effects of medi....

What are you saying...

It's the White House.

What about it?

You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is....

No, this is great.

Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.

Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do.

A new <u>take</u> on the...  Well, sir, we're coming back, we'd like you to try it out, this evening...

...mmm?

He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?

<u>IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS</u>.

...how do we Explain That?  Hey?  Am I worried...?

<u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.

It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --

We're going to have to explain away the...

It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.

Gemme a plane.  Business Aviation, National, one hour. Fly to Chicago.  O'hare, LAX 6 A.M.

Tell, tell, tell me again.

Tell me again.

...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...

Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...

Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?

Catching up on his reading.  Asked about you, sends his thanks.

Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow Moss want?

What are we going to do?

War's over, Pal. 

He thinks it's too...

Ronnie says we don't need'em for another four days.  ...s'there a problem?

Give'em another pill...

... and he spent the last twelve years in a Milit&ry Prison... 

I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...

As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...

The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled.  We are in <u>contaot</u> with the Albanian Premier, who assures me, and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and <u>has</u> not.  That the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making.

But that group has been, in the main, subdued.  Now: How did we come by this information?  And.  Who subdued that group? 

...member of the group, was left behind what were, then, Enemy Lines. 

But, you know, <u>this</u> is the meeting, Ron?  You think about it.  <u>This</u> is the meeting.  This, here.  Schumann and us.  King Kong and the Trainers...this's it... What are you working on?

This is nothing. ...piece of cake.  Y'know, producing is being a Samurai Warrior.  They pay you, day in, day out, for Years, so that, ONE DAY, when <u>called</u> upon, you can respond, your training At Its Peak, and save the day.

I gotta get something, I gotta get ...shoes?  Ties? Hats...?  Good.  Good. 

Why do people go to war?

China.

Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.

What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.

Who?

It's not "war."  It is a <u>Pageant</u>.  It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>...

N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars...

Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"

They got to have something that we want.

We don't need an Act Two.

Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...

At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...

What're you gonna do with Morse Code?

I think it's fine?

Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.

...the Albanian Campaign.  And we won't even be a footnote...

I think we asked for "special programs" and they gave us "special prisons."

We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you <u>going</u>...?

He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.

You would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went through.

But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....

William Schuman.  Old Shoe.  U.S. Army.  Serial number, 21-31-2841-262.

Look, look, look, look, Canada, okay...?  Our neighbor to the North, alla sudden, transformed, into That Place, where, like the North Wind, <u>Terror</u> comes...

Headshots.  Girls to play the girl in our footage.  I like the sorrowful one.  Anybody Else....? 

Why can't it be a ribbon?

We had Davy Crockett hats... They made a fortune.

Black...

Oh huh...

And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...

Long's you git me back for the beans...

This is <u>nothing</u>,  Wait'll you've worked with a movie star, one time, this is nothing, we keep him shot-up and happy -- the Old Days, I used to think I was a <u>pharmacist</u>, the kind of stuff I had to do.  One time...

...just want to Get Back to the Beans...

Yup.

Look Harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation. Go slow. Call Geneva and the Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint towards it but we wait...

Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?

Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.

Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.

It's a romantic and tragic drink.

He's lying.

So whaddaya say pal, wanna play some doubles at Piping? Meet the membership? I got a little blonde named Mandy, about nineteen, avec cafe au lait boobs... she's mine but she's got a cousin who has great muffins.

I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.

Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.

It concerns his future!

Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.

Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?

What the hell...

Hey the door was open.

You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.

Sell?

you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.

...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.

You sure about this FAA announcement?

...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.

Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.

Whatever night you like.

Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...

...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...

...thanks Natalie.

Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?

Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?

Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?

...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?

How do you know?

My home number's on the back...

Hi sport.

...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.

...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake...

Nice club, Mr. Gekko...

I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.

You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.

Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out.

Got him at an auction in Kentucky.

And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.

Now, wait a minute, Dad...

I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.

Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.

Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.

I don't.

You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn.

Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.

Hi.

Morning Buddy, you look happy.

You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.

Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.

Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.

Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!

And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.

The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...

Are you prepared to put that in writing?

I saw the greatest movie with mark last night

Businessman?

But?

Anybody want another drink?

And uh, your nicotine sir

Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?

Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.

If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.

This time I really don't see anyone man.

One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'

He loves you very much.  He just--

I miss you.

It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.

Did you?

Fireball?

These are good.

Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.

Your friend saw them.

Yes?

Tell me.  Please.

That's not...It's not like that.

I wanted to apologize.

I'd like to talk to you about Madison.

Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.

You think he killed her?

Seance.

Telling you...

Nothing's happening.

Are you okay?

I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...

And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.

Okay.  Okay.

I don't know.

Jody, she tried to kill him.

I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...

She's awake.

How are you?

To tell you the truth...I'm excited.

Wanna fool around?

Maybe we should just...

I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.

Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.

Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--

Claire?

It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.

I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.

And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."

He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.

Our house.

From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.

I didn't do that.

Oh.

Tonight?

...like it never even happened...

Are you lonely?

How do you know this?

What?

You don't remember?

You dropped a glass.

Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.

It's too rough.

That's not what I'm sayi--

THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.

We have to get out of here.

Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!

:Would you stop it!

Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.

Are you alright...?  You look pale.

How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?

Rowan.

I beg your par---

Lasher touched you and you loved it.

Michael...  Do what you can.

- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -

I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.

Do not tell me that!

You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..

There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.

No!

I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -

You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -

My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.

He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.

Stop it.

I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.

Hello...?

You know...?

It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -

Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.

It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.

You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.

Wanna snack...?

No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...?

ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.

I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!

On which planet...?

'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?

Wow...

A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.

He's got great hands.

I thought it was 'whistle while you work.

Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?

Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -

I thought you were someone else

Sounds good - thank you

Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN

And it can't be forged?

All the time?

Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time

Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?

If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen

Sugar?

So what do you do?

I don't know

Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?

What did you do with her?

What didn't you like about her?

You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?

What's wrong?

What's wrong?

I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...

LESLIE?  Is that good enough?

First finish your tea...

Why did you let him in?

whats wrong...what have I done wrong?

I want you out now

What happened?

What brings the rats out of the sewers?

I thought it was you - how are you?

ANGEL...

So far away? In Xenia?

Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.

Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.

I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...

How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?

I thought I loved her.

Get them together.

Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?

You got everything you ever wanted.

Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.

And I was wondering.

I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.

I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.

Well?

We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?

Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.

They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.

Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?

Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.

I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?

You do know how to drive?

I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.

Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?

Ted! Do something!

No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?

Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.

Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.

Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?

They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.

If you could just sign right there.

That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.

You're a peach.

Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!

In what sense?

What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.

She said peanuts, you cretin.

See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.

He cared enough to want you to have it.

Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.

I mean my father.

You're amazing.

Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.

A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.

He's on the move?

That has more to do with your proximity to me.

Tell me more.

Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.

Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?

They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?

Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.

Well? Surprised?

You promise you'll finish school?

You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!

That's a good start, yes. A very good start.

I never figured you for a pimp.

You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.

What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?

You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.

The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.

I told you you could do it.

You were the new and improved you.

I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.

The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.

So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.

Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?

I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.

Yes?

You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.

So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?

How you doing, Artie?

Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...

She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...

No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...

Did you try to fight him?

Then what?

Try, Kelly.

And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?

Maybe she used another name.

I've got that two o'clock in town.

You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.

This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.

Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?

Guess I kind of lost it there.

It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...

I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?

Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.

Will you do me one favor?

Yeah.

Yes.

Why?

I want a full-scale investigation.

Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.

I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?

She bit you?

A ride.  You want one?

Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?

I say something funny?

Excuse me?

The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.

Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.

Get off my property.

You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...

Don't forget the car wash.

Where's the hose?  We can set up.

Kelly.  Is Suzie there?

I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...

That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.

But check this...

Can't you take that stupid thing off?

Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.

Get away from me.

Sam, for godsake.

Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.

I had to go look for this coupon.

I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?

Sam...

I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?

What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?

Why don't you come in, have a drink?

Didn't you see her this morning?

Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?

J. S. Bach.

Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?

Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...

Aha!

Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.

Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.

Never seen a gun fire so fast!

Damn it, this is ridiculous.

So... what happened?

Uh... how long ago was this?

Can you fill me in here?

Thank you.

Oh, damn!  That's it.

So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?

What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?

There's only seventy-eight.

Are those just button buttons or...?

My hat is off to you, sir.

Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.

Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.

You didn't tell us you had this on!

A new friend?

I could get used to this, looking down on people.

Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.

Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.

Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.

Good work.  Really.

Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.

You're not that big.

We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.

I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.

You're chasing a dream.

Willow Ufgood.

No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.

You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.

They look like acorns.

I can't.

Gawd...you're...beautiful...

Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.

You're a fool.  Now put her back.

We'll probably die here, Sorsha.

Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?

Then you get us out of here.

We're a tiny version of all that?

Thanks for your help, Peck.

As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!

You all right?

You gotta promise to feed her.

You!!

Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!

She's in love.

She's a bird, Willow.

It's not a Nelwyn baby.

Dada, what's a daikini?

How am I gonna do that?

Madmartigan.

Talk!  Say something!

I've seen pictures.

How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company

Put my car in the garage and close the door.

Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.

Your hole is healed, then?

Nail it!

Everything is all right, John.

You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?

Hey, Sam...

Don't let them hurt you.

How reliable is this kid?

So one of them got to him.

Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.

More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.

You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.

Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.

Where are you taking us now?

Who are they?

How long have I been here?

You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.

That's God's way!

It's me.

Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?

You're the first one he'll contact.

Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.

I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!

Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws 

How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?

She say where he is?

No, you listen. Get out!

Is this where we're going?

Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --

Dorothy!

Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.

Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --

If she?

If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!

... -- Oz -- has spoken!

Uhhhh -- yes...

Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!

Who did it? Now wait a minute.

Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?

Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.

Oh, now?

Are you ready now?

Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?

...bed.

...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!

...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.

...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?

Oh - I'll get it!

Oh --

Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.

Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.

Oh, my!

Oh, my!

Yes -- let's run!

Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?

Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?

How about a hippopotamus?

Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!

Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.

But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.

Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.

I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!

It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!

No -- No -- No -- No!

Real courage. That's what we want.

Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.

Up!

Stop pushing!

You humbug!

Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why! 

Dorothy!

What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 

No?  Now, wait a minute.

Mr. Gale!

What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!

No, her dog!

...Tin Man!

Quiet!

I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!

Ha -- ha -- ha --

It's a whozis.

Oh, dear, dear.

Well --

-- Ruined my exit!

Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.

Shame you had to spot I wasnt the real thing.

When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?

What the hell are you talking about?

Whos she?

Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.

The King pipeline.

Zukovsky...

Elektra?  Running King Industries?  Ive known that girl all her life. Im not sure she knows what shes walking into.

Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektras ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.

Your last chance. Take the money.

The name?

Revenge isnt so hard to fathom. Whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it.

You will never touch her. You will never get near her.

I havent been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.

Does this look familiar to you?

I cant stay here.

Then take me with you.

Surely you believe in living dangerously.

Are you saying...Renard is the man whos trying to kill me?

All this, because you fell for Renard?

So you killed your father.

Was this all about the oil?

I thought you were the one in her business.

That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!

What?

No! Bond!

Ill send someone out.

Perhaps this isnt the time...

Warm.

Everythings under control up here.  Are you ready?

We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.

Hi, Jon.

In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .

Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.

Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.

Jon, I do not want to hear it.

Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?

No.  I just wanted you to --

Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .

It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.

Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?

Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .

Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --

No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?

Old?

This'd better not be what I think it is.

They're practically on us . . .

What?

He saved himself.  He changed the past.

So do I.  So do you.

Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.

CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.

. . . And they call me a fucking nut.

Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --

He's a little farther gone every time.

What about you?

Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.

CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --

Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.

Who the hell are you?

What is this place?

Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.

Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.

You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.

You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.

You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.

This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".

Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.

You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.

What do you have?

Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys

So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.

The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...

But programmable. And expendable.

We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?

What game is that?

Like what?

If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?

You do everything Yorgi says?

Where are you going?

I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?

That's alright, I'll figure something out.

What's that?

Aren't you afraid?

Did you do your homework?

By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!

What are you doing?

What are you doing?

From the Beastie Boys collection?

I can see that. Why?

I'm having fun, what's the problem?

You're serious?

Sit down.

Nice hops.

They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?

Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?

I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.

I had to inspect the merchandise first.

What's this?

Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!

Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.

To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."

I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.

What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.

And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.

You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --

Scott.. I -

Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.

Jean... can you?

How long have you been in Alaska?

I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.

There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.

The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.

Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.

I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...

You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?

Come with me and I'll let her live.

What are you going to do?

Now that's Magneto talking.

Where are we going?

How?

Is that so?

Oh, shit.

What was your grandfather's name?

Where did you get this cauliflower?

Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?

Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.

What?

Still happy you married me?

Love me oodles and oodles?

And your passport?

Call me from New York before you leave??

Mother's going to help me with the invitations.

Does that mean you love me?

Surprised?

What a strange fellow.

Are you suggesting I call him master???

I suppose you're right.

I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.

You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.

There seem to be quite a few books.

I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?

What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?

How long will this whole thing take?

That's 'Fronkonsteen.'

My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.

But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!

You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,

And do you also say Fro dereck?

Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?

There wolf!  There castle!

The wockers with the knockers.

You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?

Did you see anyone else down here?

Do you have the name I wrote down?

That's not bad.

I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?

It's always been one of my favorite names.

You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.

Throw the second switch!

It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?

More, do you hear me?

You can't win 'em all.

You'll be getting me sad next.

Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.

Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.

But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.

What monster?

You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.

There's only one way.

It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?

Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!

MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!

May I see your violin?

Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.

Inga!

'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.

I'd be so nervous.

Good night, Doctor.

Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.

Just passing through the night.

No, not sound.

I'm getting tired.

What d'ya want to do to kill time?

Do you have a reservation?

Drink!

What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?

Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?

You intended to bring your reserves across the river?

Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?

Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .

Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
