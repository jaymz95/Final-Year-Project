Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.

You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?

No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---

The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.

How do you get your hair to look like that?

Sure have.

do you listen to this crap?

Wow

Great

He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.

So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.

Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?

I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.

Joey never told you we went out, did he?

In 9th.  For a month

Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.

That's not

You looked beautiful last night, you know.

Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...

What if she never starts dating?

Oh, God.  It's starting.

Wear the belly before you go.

Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --

I'm missing something.

Why do girls like that always like guys like that?

Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.

I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.

What makes you think he'll do it?

No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...

I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.

You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.

This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.

Will Bogey get bent?

Number one.  She hates smokers

Her favorite uncle

Extremely unfortunate maneuver.

You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.

And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.

Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.

Cameron -- do you like the girl?

Leave my sister alone.

You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.

Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.

But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?

Who's that?

I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.

So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.

You think this'll work?

Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?

You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.

I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?

There's a way to get a guy's attention.

You hate me don't you?

You're not okay.

This is so patronizing.

And I'm in control of it.

When you were gone last year -- where were you?

Start a band?

Who?

Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.

I heard there was a poetry reading.

Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.

I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.

Put your right foot there --

You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?

The Partridge Family?

A soft side? Who knew?

So what's your excuse?

Yes

Is that a request or a command?

A Fender Strat. You bought this?

Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?

My insurance does not cover PMS

Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?

You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.

Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.

Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?

Cool pictures.  You a fan?

Say it

That's where we can help you.  With Kat.

Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?

Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?

What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap

We should have seen land.

Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.

Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.

Are we going to argue?

How far from here?

I want to go with you!

Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?

But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.

Say not here!  Cuba!

Chief says -- how many?

Why do you wish to sail west?

Father Marchena!

How long?

I have to disagree.

I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.

Do they have such thoughts?

And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.

We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!

You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.

... Into a monk...

... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...

Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?

...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...

Are you married?

What about back home?

You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?

Is he your boyfriend?

I'll make some for us.

A cop?

How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.

Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.

Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?

Any I.D.?

I don't even watch TV.

Hmmmm.

Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.

Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.

Why not?

Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.

So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.

Is it drug related?

Do you have the suspect in custody?

Eddie, are you okay?

Okay, til tonight.

You promise?

I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.

Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?

You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?

We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.

What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?

This all you want?

Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.

Turn that fucking thing off!

Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.

What is it?

I did.

What is that?

Let me get a shot of it.

Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?

Emil???!

I can get you a job.

Yes, the money is good.

Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.

No.  Go ahead.

What was that?

We're takin' him.  Don't argue!

I'll send a cop back for you.

Mouth's clean, too.

You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.

What are you gonna do?

Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.

This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.

Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.

It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.

CONTINUED

CONTINUED

Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.

Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.

Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?

I suppose the idea was specialized training.

Oh?

I know. It would be almost inconceivable.

I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.

Good morning. How's it going?

I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.

Two more.

Is your confidence in me fully restored?

Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.

CONTINUED

I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?

Are you coming to my party?

When are you coming home?

I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.

Oh, that's such a delightful age.

Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.

This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.

What do you mean?

Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.

Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?

Hal, have pod arms secure the component.

Roger.

Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?

Name?

I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.

Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.

Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.

Well, maybe I'll see you later ...

Hello, again.

How about it?

Where's ganz?

We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...

Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?

I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.

Hey, this works pretty good.

Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.

You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?

I don't give out the details.

Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.

Well?

If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...

You made that move, huh?

We split 50-50?

Where's the money?

Right, partner.

If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.

Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.

I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...

It's late, they're closing...

Hey, there she is...

You okay?

Thanks.

Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...

What the bell happened?

What a screw-up.

Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?

He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.

Billy Bear...

Who are all these?

Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?

You look awful.

Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.

Bullshit red tape.

A cop...

If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.

Maybe you ought to buy me one.

Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...

The number ... what's the Goddamn number?

Hello.

Whaddya think?

I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.

How hot are they?

I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...

You chickenshit punk...

How about some ammo?

Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?

Who are you?

We have to save the world.

Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?

But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?

Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.

They really made her...

I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!

Where's Leeloo?

She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!

Do you love her?

I don't have time... I need to know.

I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.

At least, the cat comes back.

I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.

Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..

Akina delutan, nou-shan.

Are you listening to me, you ingrate!

Other than that... You all right?

You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!

I'm sorry..

6... 5...

...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?

I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?

You know how to fly this thing?

To save the world.

...Shit!

...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.

Dinoine chagantakat!

Love...

Which one?

I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.

Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?

It's up to you now, Angel!

What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!

I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.

Tell me...

Talk English Doc.

Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.

I want your best man on this!

Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.

Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?

What's this... have you been smoking... ?

I'm not accusing you...

You should have.

Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...

What?

Anything harder?

It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.

You said something about money.

He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.

What's the problem?

You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?

Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?

Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.

Alright, Tom.

There are reasons for the way we do things here.

What's he talking about?

Starting to recognize a pattern?

How much did he pay you?

So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.

What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?

Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.

I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.

You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...

I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.

Look, you cocksucker...

As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.

So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.

Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...

You almost went over your limit.

My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.

Not quite.

How much do you make now?

You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.

I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?

What about me?

Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...

You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.

Wha... ?

Who is he?

You don't need to be here.

What's this?

Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?

There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...

It's a film... of a girl being murdered.

It won't work like that.

One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...

You told me to look, so I looked.

Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?

I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?

What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...

Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?

I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.

I didn't mean to...

I had to ask.  I apologize.

Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.

Do you think the police did a good job?

How... how can you say that to me...?

My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...

Hello... ?

Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...

They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...

He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...

Her belongings?

No, sir, he is not.

Okay, I'll take it all.

Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.

Alice, you think you can leave?

Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.

No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.

Kristen, what happened?

I know.  I hardly have any time to study.

You've been up all night?

No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.

You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.

Honey, we went over this in therapy.

What is it?

I'll tell you later.

You don't get it, he's after me...

Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.

We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.

Is that who you're waiting for?

I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.

Mommy...?

What do you mean?

Hi, beautiful.

You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...

There you go.  Love you.

How was the meeting?

Very funny.

Since when are you such a smart shopper?

Did everyone call everyone?

It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.

And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!

But how are we gonna --

Mark, are you okay?

I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...

I thought about that.

No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?

Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!

I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.

What is it?

What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'

That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !

But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.

You've got to let us try, Skipper --

How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.

Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!

Dave - !

You better take Powell and Carney with you --

Excuse me, Skipper---

Now they feel it...down below.

...above Murmansk, and Finland.

Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.

'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?

What's the running time?

Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?

Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!

Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!

My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -

Always has been.

What are you boys up to?

-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.

LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?

Guaranteed, eh?

You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.

Mmm.

Double A. New Britain.

Like you and Gordon?

No, I mean whereabouts.

Where'd you get the blood?

There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.

Was it funny?

Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.

It's fun.

Are we going in this?

You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?

That's illegal, you know.

You don't want the extra police pay?

Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?

That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.

Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.

Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.

Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?

Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?

New hat?  Jill's up, I see.

How's she doing?

I'm sorry about what I said.

You don't mean that.

Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.

I can see what you looked like as a kid.

What happened?

Going somewhere, Margie?

What the hell are you talking about?

Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?

Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.

Who are you?

You talked to Jack?

Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?

Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.

Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?

Yeah.

Is there something wrong with the phone?

Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?

Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.

Call it what you want.

Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!

Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!

Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?

It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.

No shit.

Lillian was here. In Lawford.

Get some sleep.

Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.

Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.

Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?

So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.

It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?

To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?

I don't drink coffee.

How was...  ...the ballet?

Alice!

How you doing, sweetie?

Who's flying the fucking plane?

Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.

He's dead then. They must have killed him.

Walter, if you have a point, make it.

They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.

It was a good ad-lib, sir.

Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.

The Chief Justice? What on earth for?

We've already been inspected.

Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.

We copy. Stand by...  Tower?

Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.

Why? Do you enjoy it?

Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.

The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.

Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.

The taste of defeat is bitter, no?

Finally, we can bargain.

I'll not going without my family.

Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.

For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.

I don't know why you stayed.

The fax machines.

Where's my family?

Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.

*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.

With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.

Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.

Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?

Shit.

What?

Elaine.

Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.

Ted!  What are you...?

Elaine!

Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.

You mean...

We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!

Now!

You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.

For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.

Roger.

Can I say something of a personal nature to you?

Request; life support systems check.

Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?

He's a boy dog.

Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.

Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?

You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.

Striker.

...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.

I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.

We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?

All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?

Elaine!

Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.

Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?

You got a telegram from head­quarters today.

I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.

I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!

It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.

Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.

So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.

I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.

We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.

Would either of you like another cup of coffee?

Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?

Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.

Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.

Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?

Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.

You okay?

He's not here.  Why ask me?

In there.

Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...

He didn't recognize me.

... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.

Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?

Let's talk Hubley.

Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.

I believe I should interview the widow alone.

Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.

Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?

Back off, George.

I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?

We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.

Was.  Divorced.

Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.

I'm going home.

What was that about?

... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.

How potent?

Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?

Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.

Uh, George...

George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...

George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.



No!  We must do this alone.

I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.

Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?

How do I look?

You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.

Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.

Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?

One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?

You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...

No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.

How can I go?

You got your vest?

Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.

This floor's freezing.

Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.

Can't lock up...

Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.

Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.

I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.

Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.

That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.

It's going to be closer.  You better get going.

You did okay, Bishop.

Have they located my daughter yet?

You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.

You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?

I hope you're right.  I really do.

They're right under the primary heat exchangers.

Now, wait a second --

You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?

I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.

Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.

We're talking thermonuclear explosion.

What is it?

How do you feel?

All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...

All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.

They're in the approach corridor.

Now many?

Newt time then can walk right up and knock.

What's this?

Hicks, don't let him leave.

Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?

This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.

I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.

Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.

They cut the power.

Fifteen meters.

Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.

No, it's different, honey.

Yes.  A little girl.

Don't go!  Please.

Burke!  Open the door!

Are we going to sleep now?

Can we dream?

Look, I told you...

How do you know?

Oh!

Why?

Did you know? Had you heard?

What did you think of the music?

Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.

No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.

Don Giovannnnnnnni!

Stop it!

Where?

Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.

Do you think that's funny?

Oh, ha, ha, ha.

Tish-I'm tee. What's that?

Tish-I'm-tee.

Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?

No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.

All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?

What's the matter with you?

I don't know.

Half the receipts! Stanzi!

Who was that?

This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?

Why not?

Excellency!

I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.

Then he didn't send you?

I see.

Come back tonight.

No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.

I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.

Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?

I see that you're expecting.

When, may I ask?

What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.

He's adorable!

Behold!

Upstairs.

What a strange young man.

May I try it?

Well, I'm glad to hear that.

As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!

And German?

Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.

Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.

Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?

Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?

Would you tell me why?

Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.

Well, what do you have for me today?

I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.

Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.

Do you always live like this?

She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.

Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.

Yes.

Why not?

Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.

No, really!

Papa, is this your idea?

Are you playing a trick on me?

Father -

Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.

I think I've found out about the money, sir.

What?

Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?

What?

You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.

Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?

Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.

Love, Sire!

Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.

Herr Sommer.

No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.

They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!

Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?

Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.

You burned the score?

Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.

It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?

Did my work please you?

I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.

You mean she's not coming back?

Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.

Would you? Actually, you could.

But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.

Strange!

C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.

And that's it. Do you have it?

We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.

Oh? Have I seen it?

What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.

Exactly. A dance.

No, but I'm the best.

Who is on this committee?

Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!

Mozart -

How well are you trained in music?

I can't say I do. What is it?

All Vienna has heard that.

Do you hear me?

No? Was Mozart a good man?

Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.

I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.

Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.

Ballet? What ballet?

Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.

That lady is back, sir.

Herr Salieri.

You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?

Can I be of service, Miss Price?

Oh, Miss Price?

Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?

Yes.

You've absolutely no idea where David might be?

Surely you're not suggesting...

He's here.

What shall we do?

It wasn't a lunatic.

I'm afraid you have to eat something.

You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.

This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.

You're a very beautiful girl.

Do you like it?

How old are you?

Hello. You all right?

That's easy enough.

What?

Bathroom.

But, David.

It's silly of you to be apprehensive.

Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?

I'm off. There's food in the fridge.

Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!

David, what are you doing?

David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.

Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...

Feeling better?

How are we feeling tonight?

Officer, I killed those people last night.

All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.

Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.

I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.

Miss Price! Miss Price, please!

You've never had bad dreams before?

Are you cold?

That's not a spear. It's a pike.

Hello.

Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.

Jack, we'd better go.

That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.

What do you think was wrong?

Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.

I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.

It sounds far away.

You really scared me, you shithead.

I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.

What?!

What's wrong with you? Shut up!

The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.

What are you doing here?

Get out of here, Jack!

Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.

What can we do to assist you?

Yes?

Hello, there. What can I get you?

What's that?

Then you have some hot tea?

Sorry.

Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...

Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest

What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.

If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?

Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.

About twenty-four thousand.

Whose death?

You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.

Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything

The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?

No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.

Say, you can't do that

Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!

Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?

Fifty thousand dollars!

Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I

know, but

But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?

This won't do. Not during business hours . . .

Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.

Doesn't that come next?

Well, what?

Why are you so anxious?

Why, Matt!

Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?

Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.

Excuse me

Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.

Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?

Why - well, I

Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.

Oh!

Yes?

Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?

Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.

I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!

All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?

You're lying!

He's at a board meeting.

No.

What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?

Well . . . ?

In Cluett's office?

What's keeping you?

Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.

Oh, Matt . . .

Did you talk to him?

The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?

Did you say Dude Finlay?

for the rheumatism, you know.

Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...

Then who changed it?

You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.

Where's Charlie?

Gatling! They've got a Gatling!

No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.

We got a problem here, brother?

This is the best score yet.

Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.

The Army can hang him.

Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.

Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...

Beg pardon?

The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...

Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.

He's planning a job.

Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...

What you sayin' boy?

You shut up now, boy.

The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.

The James-Younger Gang.

See, Frank's being smart about this.

It's not a bank.

Beautiful.

And almost got hanged in peacetime.

Bob, rip up some bandages.

WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!

Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.

Well?

I think one of 'em's glass.

I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.

Jesse.

OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!

Of St. Louis?

Then why can't I go in there?

Fine. I'll just wait here.

He's going to be fine, right Daddy?

Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.

Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.

Hell of a war.

Hello, Liberty Missoura!

She's still talking to Jesus.

-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.

I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.

You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --

How'd it go in there?

They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.

Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.

Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.

Uncle Frank?

Did you kill Yankees?

Ma! Please!

Jesse, is that your hand?

You're sick of my company?

I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.

I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.

You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.

Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?

Zee.

I don't understand.

I would never have imagined us in a place like this.

Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?

Let me see that.

Aw, shucks, ma'am...

Don't turn around.

We're moving you tomorrow.

You almost ended my career before it began.

Now let's have a drink.

You okay, Jesse?

Jim, you been with a girl yet?

Well, not exactly.

Why, yeah.

Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.

There's only four of them...

Really!

Good.

To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.

Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.

I want them arrested and hanged!

This is no game.

First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.

Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.

Yes?

I know. Stop it.

Are we here?

It's a plain end. I think.

That's nice.

Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?

I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...

Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.

Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.

Why? What's wrong?

I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.

If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.

You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .

Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?

But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?

Because he dated her.

Listen, what about dinner?

Excuse me. I really must he going.

It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?

SHUT UP!

I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.

Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...

Don't tell me...merchant banking?

I said we are totally booked.

After six.

Yes?

Patrick?

Jean?

That is...if you're not doing anything.

Anywhere you want?

Oh, I can't.  I don't know.

Yes? You're dressed...okay.

Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.

Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.

Forget it.

I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.

Patrick Bateman's office.

Patrick? Is that you?

Patrick? I can't hear you.

Welt...it depends, why?

Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.

She's my...cousin.

Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.

Who?

Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?

Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?

Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?

Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.

Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.

You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?

Coffee?

Well, what's the topic of discussion?

Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.

Where did you go to school?

Bad habit.

How well did you know him?

Yeah...Yale thing.

Do you feel that way?

He had a yacht?

Anything else you can tell me about Owen?

Have you consulted a psychic?

That's so typical, isn't it?

Nothing.

The earth just opens up and swallows people. 

I mean they want to get caught.

Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?

Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.

No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.

Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 

I'm so hungry.

Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.

Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.

Really? That's interesting.  Not great?

You like Huey Lewis and the News?

What!

What're you -- what?

It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.

Go where? You can't get away from people like this.

You think I don't know that?

How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.

They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.

It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?

That was -- different.

Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.

Are you gonna tell me where you went?

Right. Wait. A toast.

Mr. Barton, do you remember me?

Milo?

Milo?

Well I parked illegally. See y'later?

Will I get to work for Outpost?

What?

That's gotta kill him, right?

Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.

'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?

'Think I should buy some originals?

Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?

It scales, don't you think?

Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.

That's great! Thanks.

"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail?

Gary, I --

Okay, #2.

All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.

I think you should go.

You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?

Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?

I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.

Did you wanna be alone?

They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?

Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.

Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.

That's great. I -- didn't know.

I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.

Time?

I don't know --

I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --

Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.

You could always say you have to go the bathroom.

...He knows.

Is that how Larry feels?

But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.

I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?

So -- how far are we from the campus?

Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.

Did you download Corey? In San Jose?

There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.

Who're these guys?

'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'

Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?

Yes.

"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.

Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.

Oh, and Austin...

Oh, yes. Thank you.

Yes?

Hello, Exposition.

Excuse me?

Carnies.

Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.

My mother's told me all about you.

My wedding tackle.

Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?

Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.

Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.

Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.

Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?

I don't get it.

Not in the Nineties.

Not a good time to lose one's head.

What do we do now?

I have something to tell you.

OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.

Shut up.

We've got a lot of work to do.

Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?

Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.

Quite impressive.

Right.

No, the boy's right. I really am evil.

Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.

Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?

Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?

Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.

I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.

We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.

Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.

Did you ever want to?

What do you want to do, Scott?

Really?

Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.

Nature ...

Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.

London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.

I resign.

What are you trying to do to me?

Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.

Who?

You know, I believe she's actually jealous.

The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.

Choices?

Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.

Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.

Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.

I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?

I didn't. Mother did.

You can but I wish you wouldn't ...

That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.

Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...

Three agents killed by bad weather...

Someone didn't want us to get to the party.

Steed ... !

To kill me?

No, after you.

I'll be back ...

English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...

I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.

Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...

Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?

Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.

The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --

Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...

You're not venturing alone, surely.

We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.

You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?

Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --

Look at that guy. What a hunk.

That's what we're going to find out...

Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.

Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.

All right!

Cole...

Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...

Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...

Great car.

I love that car.

Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!

Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?

Fine. How's everything going?

Nice shot.

You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.

That feels so great.

Um... that's very relaxing.

Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...

Remember, you promised... no screwing around.

Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.

Let go of me!

See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?

Give him the works.

Let's go.

Guy paints a beautiful picture.

What can I be doing for you?

You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.

You okay?

You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?

Oops!

Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.

Welcome, welcome, one and all.

The end.

You've been having strange sex...!

How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?

Don't you love it when old friends stop by?

What the hell is that?

Under the table!

Right in there, pal.

Reach out and snort someone.

True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?

That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.

Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.

That's Franny. She likes firemen.

-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.

You gotta let me finish --

-- Stephen, this is bullshit --

Been ripping off fire stations?

There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.

Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...

I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.

-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!

Hey.

Roll the hose.

You okay?

That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.

Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.

I saw it.

-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --

I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!

You're back.

Huh.

Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.

I work for city hall.

Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.

Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.

Hi.

Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.

See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?

When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.

Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --

Hi.

Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?

I think your boss is going to need some spin control.

Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?

I'm close... but I can't get who it is...

Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?

Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?

You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --

Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.

If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --

Are you still here?

Where are you going?

Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.

Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier

No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.

What the hell are you doing here?

I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.

Then who wrote the report?

Did I say thanks?

So what do you want me to do?

Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.

Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?

Oh, man, I'm sorry.

Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.

Stephen, what are you doing here?

He treats you okay?

I know he's out, but how's he doing?

Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.

Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.

Who's this?

Knock it off. Now.

-- Burn them.

Got a cause?

Alderman Swayzak.

Inspector.

Is there a connection between them, Alderman?

Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --

I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.

Susie's not a virgin anymore.

Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...

OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?

Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!

...Benedict Arnold...

Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!

He gots to be did.

Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!

Well you did.

Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.

My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?

We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.

The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.

Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.

It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.

DeLa - what's the matter with you.

So that's what you been doing?

What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?

Nice to meet you.

Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.

Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.

We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?

Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.

But the line has to be drawn.

Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.

That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.

Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.

The name of the show?

Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.

Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.

Yep, you guessed it.

Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.

We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?

And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.

I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.

Besides, what does he know about Negroes?

This has to be a big mistake.

I gots to go, it's my Moms.

I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.

The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.

I love you too, Daddy.

So he drank himself into a stuper?

How was it?

Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.

You've said that already.

Your life will never be the same.

So you have your small victory, now what?

The Jolly Nigger Bank.

Thanks.

How so?

Why'd you do that?

Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.

That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.

That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.

So they can be on TV.

Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.

No.

How did you get this gig?

I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.

So what's up with you and DeLa?

Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.

Not her, the one with the little...

Oh, because on our first date, she let me...

Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.

I feel a song a comin' on.

People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.

Oh you do, huh?

I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.

Good day to you, young sir.

This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?

Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.

Sir, I'm a British officer.

Has he sent the challenge yet?

Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!

I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.

Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.

I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.

No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.

Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.

Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.

Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?

Who else can give me information about you?

The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?

Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?

Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.

Never.

Not even that.

That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.

Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.

A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.

To make me wretched in two weeks.

Why are you shaking?

But you refused me, Dorothy.

Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.

Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?

All the same, you must name an amount.

Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?

Does this assignment interest you?

Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?

As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?

May I be quite frank with you?

I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.

Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.

In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.

I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?

Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.

Yeah, if you've slept.

Hurricane kept you up, too?

Did -- did you --

This isn't our area. Whose area is this --

Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.

What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --

Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.

Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.

Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --

That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.

He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?

You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.

So you killed him?

Whose blood is that, Jay?

Mueller.

Why... why didn't you tell me?

Full clip to the body --

Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...

A test will no doubt link you to the killing --

He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?

What happened to "degrees"?

Why did he come back for you?

How do you know?

Where are they!

The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...

Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?

Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --

He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --

Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.

Nevertheless --

It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?

Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.

Is Dunbar cute?

Baseball?

I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.

West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.

I didn't shoot West...

Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.

Are you sure?

I pushed him too hard.

You wanted to break him.

So what now?

We were close to something with Kendall.

No.

We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --

No bodies, no West...

What if I don't want it?

Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.

A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.

You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?

I was freezing from the hurricane --

He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.

He said what?

It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --

What the fuck happened to you --

Thank God...

This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --

You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --

Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.

Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!

What do you mean? You don't even know me.

Someone stole my backpack.

Welcome to ya. What's your name?

Bloom like a flower?

Then do it.

Fine, you do it.

How long have you known my father?

How would you describe him?

How are you gonna make it without your shoes?

Helping people makes me happy.

You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.

It's okay, just leave it.

Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.

Hi. How are you feeling?

Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.

Spooning the sherbet.

Karl.

You --  -- are in for a surprise.

And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?

When did you ever work in an office?

Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.

Son?

I'm trying to make a metaphor here.

Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.

The river.

Tell me how it happens.

Let's get out of here.

You don't even know me.

Wait! I need those!

I don't believe it!

How did you know my father?

You didn't become crazy.

I'm going to get started on dishes.

Mmm.

You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.

How is he?

I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.

Was she one of your teachers?

I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.

Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.

What?

What. You're what? You're with this creep now.

This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.

You can see why it's sensitive?

What did he say?

And...

Hold on.

Right.

I...

Tell me what he said.

Do you believe in love?

How is bank?

He wants a lot of money.

So. Is it different to how you imagined it?

I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?

And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?

Good. Or should I speak slower?

Uh... Are you a giraffe?

I don't understand.

Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.

I'm going to be sick. Where's the...

I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.

What?

Give me some money.

What?

Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.

Shut up. I'm not listening.

And who says what is wrong.

Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.

Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.

What?

Excuse me?

You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.

I wasn't saying anything.

The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.

Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?

You can probably buy them on the flight.

Whatever.

What does it mean?

My name's Sophia.

Is the flight full?

I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.

My little niece... she got this deep cough.

Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...

Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.

Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.

Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...

Hey.

What do you need?

And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?

Sit down, man. Need a beer?

Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.

With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.

It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.

Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!

Thought you had a skirt earlier.

Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.

You wanna go home?

Better?

Laz... You can't say nothin'...

YOU SHUT UP!

Or what? OR WHAT?

Like a man.

Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.

I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...

You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.

Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!

Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...

Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?

My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!

Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?

If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?

You take it straight?

Want another?

Still makin' jokes?

Where you gonna be?

Are you drunk?  Keep drinkin' water and you won't get a headache in the mornin'.

Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?

I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.

He tapped that.

I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.

You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.

Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?

You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?

Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.

You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?

There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.

Thank you.

You a preacher?

You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.

It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!

No. I just got a messed up stomach.

What?

Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!

Didn't know you was workin' here now?

Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?

Alright. How much you need, ho?

He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.

Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.

Frank Abolofia.

What'd you say?

I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.

Getting very weird.

... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.

What does Ichiro mean, anyway?

... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!

Nick!

What'd I tell you?

Nick...

Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --

Because he knows how to get to our man.

Nick, you can't do this.

Start it.

You did great, Ichiro.

I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.

She ever pull down her shades?

I need your help, Joyce.

I don't remember saying yes.

One guy do all the damage?

How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.

We're police officers.

Could you fill me in?

Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!

Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.

Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.

Why tell me this?

With these?

Good.

He knows what he's doing.

I want more life, fucker.

Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.

Why are you staring at us?

We have a lot in common.

You could help us.

What about your friend, the man who owns this building?

I'd be happy to mention it to him.

I want to do it.

What was he after?

Yeah.

She was gonna get away.

Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.

Number three.

Thank you very much.

Prosit.

You want to see my friends?

Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.

Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.

What if you change your mind?

My job is here.

You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?

This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...

What shows?

What the fuck for?

The best.

You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.

Is there anything else?

You use your equipment, don't you?

Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.

I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.

When was the last time you cleaned this place?

Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?

Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.

Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.

Is this to be an empathy test?

May I ask a personal question?

Well?

And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?

I kinda get nervous when I take tests.

You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...

Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...

Know what a turtle is?

Same thing.

Where are your folks?

I'm hungry, J.F.

What makes you think so?

Hi!

This is my new friend...

How do you do?

No, I'm lost.

So far?

Again.

I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!

Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!

Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!

Wait!  Wait!

Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?

You got it! Wait here while I change.

Wait! Wait!

Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.

Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?

Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.

I don't want to be alone.

Bites what?

It didn't used to be that way.

Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.

Could we talk about that a little later?

Get out!

Stop that ma'am crap!

I was wrong!!

Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?

You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!

The guy with the underpants!

I certainly do!

Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.

No!  Not crazy!

I thought I was here to meet women.

I like her.

What?

You wanted to see me!

Adam?!

Eve, if you'll let me, I can --

I know first aid!

I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.

Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?

A card?

Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.

You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!

Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!

These are wonderful.

Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!

Well, do we just go on up?!

C'est bon, Monsieur.

Not particularly.

I love Lucy!

Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.

That's right?

Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!

I don't think so.

Why did you park way back there?

What?!

And thanks for always being happy!

Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.

You don't look thirty-five.

Up here on the fifteenth floor?

See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.

Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.

Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.

We have to go.

This is your bedroom?

No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!

You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.

All back East.

Really?

For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!

Well, put it down and come in!

It shuts off automatically.

No.  They all do.

You hear that?!

Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.

Cheese is particularly troublesome.

Thirty -five years!

We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.

Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!

Maybe I've just got the creeps.

Uh, oh. Now it's time.

Calvin?!

Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.

One who doesn't glow in the dark.

Should we say a little prayer first?

Yes.

We stay down here.

Yes.

For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!

No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!

What are you bitching about now?

So, Adam...where on earth are you from?

Give me your hand.

I don't know.

Well, what do you think?

Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!

Go to the bathroom.

What's it to you?!

To bed?

And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!

So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.

What's wrong?

Yeah! That's thinking.

We came back to the house!

Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?

I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?

Buy it from me?

Is that why you say it's horrible?

What is this? What color is it?

What color is it?

Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.

For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.

Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.

Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?

An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.

Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?

Sure I'm alright. 

You can hit me, if you want to.

Do you like me?

Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.

I liked being with you last night.

Oh shit.

Look.

It used to make me laugh, but.

Yes. Frank--

I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.

Do you like my body?

Shut up.

Look, snap out of it, will ya?

Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!

You what?

Oh no.

He's comin' back? What for?

Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.

Hello, baby.

MOMMY!

Can I feel 'em?

Frank, he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. Come on. He didn't mean it.

You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.

Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.

Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?

Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.

Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?

Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.

No, I'm just gonna walk around.

Can I use the car tonight?

It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.

He comes over to study.

Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.

How ya doin' Dad?

No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?

How is Central these days?

I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.

I guess you have to get back home soon?

You really do hear a lot, don't you?

I don't want to cause any trouble.

Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?

Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?

Are you alright?

No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.

Yeah, if it opens the door.

I owe you, since I goofed up this one.

What's the plan.

Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.

Yeah, but.

Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?

I'm going to wait here until she comes.

You want to tell me about it?

Twice. Without her sensing anything?

Did you see her undressed?

So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.

Can I give you a kiss good night?

Okay, okay.

You worry about me really?

Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.

Everything okay?

Okay.

Fuck you.

Hey, I just...

Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.

Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.

Are these me considered armed and dangerous?

Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.

What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!

She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.

No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?

Anybody see ya?

What the fuck are you doing?

What? What is it?

They got nothing.

You guys?

No ma! No!

Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.

Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.

Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.

We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.

What are you going to do?

Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.

I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.

No fuckin' hot water man. That...

A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.

"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"

Charlie Bronson's always got rope.

I'm serious.

I don't know they just always need it.

There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?

Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...

Yeah?

Maybe the three of them had something in common.

Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 

The what man?

That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.

Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.

Who the...

Chief, what the fuck is this?

How many bodies, Greenly?

A couple of peons for the mob and...

Roc. You okay?

Liberating isn't it?

Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.

Worst day of my life, man.

Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.

Hello? You there?

But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.

You gonna do what I say, got it?

Have you no fear of God?

Just be natural, goddamit.

Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?

Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.

He's a nigger.

Continue the joke.

Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.

Why?

See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.

What does Starsky say?

Did you see what I meant about the window?

That's true. But what if they change the locks?

Is it back in?

Anthony, give me the fucking gun!

I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.

See if mine are in there.

What about them?

OK. Go ahead.

Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.

May I have a word with you, please?

Which one was that?

She's from Cuba.

See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.

But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.

When'd he tell you?

He told you and you let him do it.

We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.

Why don't you come with us.

I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --

I'm not. But there's --

We've got sixteen dollars.

I want you to look at this.

Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.

What exactly is this place? Freezers?

I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.

Or I might end up with a broken nose.

Uh-huh?

Who did that? What the fuck is that?

You're kidding.

Come on.

Dignan, it's too late.

You got to be kidding me.

You're living on a sailboat?

No. I'm not.

When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.

Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --

Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:

You mean a safecracker?

That was a test?

Did Dignan take the test?

Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.

This is good.

Absolutely.

Hector woudn't do anything.

Let them fight.

See you.

How long are they going to hold him?

What?

I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.

No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?

Let me see it.  Did you drop it?

Yeah.

Were you born in Mexico?

Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?

S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?

You don't celebrate til it's over.

Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.

What did I say?

You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.

What are you doing?

How much is there?

That could be anybody's.

Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.

What do you mean get back?

Give me the keys, Dignan.

Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.

It's too bad about what happened on the road.

Bob, you're lying!

I might have mentioned it.

How long do you have to go?

Ground defense.

Oh, yeah.

You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?

He left his sweater.

Is that your chiquita?

You like Chicanos?

You a good pool player.

Come on in!

John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.

Well, we'll see you later, Bob.

No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.

Let's talk about Conklin.

Berlin!

Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?

My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.

Had to be done.

In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.

Who else knows about this?

It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?

They loved you.  And I killed them.

Because you're afraid!

You called it in?

Where were you, Jason? In the car.

-- it hasn't been two years --

But we were so careful.

So...

Where --

I did.

You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!

So when was I here?

My first job.

No... Jason... please...

Okay, how do you want to do it?

Okay, Jason, your move.

We need to get in there.

We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.

This is everything? Is there.

-- who? -- who else is here? --

Still...

Mr. Nevins?

How long have you worked for the agency?

I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??

So he fooled you.

You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?

Did you?

What do you think? Is he coming in?

Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.

Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!

Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?

They're coming!

Test of manhood.

Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?

You'll move

My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.

No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.

Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.

I have faced him. Have you?

Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --

Thank you for accepting.

Did it work?

Then when?

I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.

I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.

Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?

I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.

You have... you have a husband.

You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?

You will die! It will be awful!

No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.

War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.

Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?

And you say he doesn't remember any of it?

We're gonna be late again.

Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.

I don't know... I don't remember.

Why do you ask?

I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...

You're. Acting. Like your father.

What did you see? What did it look like?

It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.

Books?

Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?

Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.

God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?

When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?

Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?

I don't understand, where are you taking me?

It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?

I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.

Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?

On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.

Oh? There's proof now?

Where are we going?

Is something the matter?

I was?

I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?

What time is it?

Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?

There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.

Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?

Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...

So what's the point?

Come on, go on...

It didn't feel like a dream.

Uh, we should be getting to class now.

Are you sure you even packed it?

Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?

Look what you made me do!

He did. Captain Renault did.

Yes, I'll bet.

And he is still willing to give you a visa?

And you want to know --

I see.

Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?

But Sacha always puts out that light --

I want you to take Miss Lund home.

Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.

Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.

The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.

Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.

Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.

Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.

It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.

And Mademoiselle?

Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.

There are only two other alternatives for him.

Not an easy day to forget.

I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.

Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?

Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.

I don't know the finish yet.

It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.

Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.

Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --

And then?

Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.

But Richard, no, I, I --

Yes.

It's been a long time.

Does he always leave so early?

Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.

Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."

Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.

Goodnight.

What happened with Rick?

Ask me?

Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --

Are you ready Ilsa?

Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.

Hello, Rick.

How do you do?

I beg your pardon?

I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.

But we made a deal.

Everything in order?

Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!

Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.

I believe you have a message for him?

I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.

Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.

You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.

What else, my dear Major?

Mademoiselle.

Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?

We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.

My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.

Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.

That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.

Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.

Oh, but I just told you. --

I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.

Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.

Yeah, you were saying?

That makes Rick a citizen of the world.

Oh, no, Rick never --

Oh, it's my party.

Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?

Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.

So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.

You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.

And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.

Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.

I have the letters right here.

I have. Sit down over there.

And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.

Will I see you tonight?

Make it official, if you like.

I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?

Boss, ain't you going to bed?

Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.

Shit!  Shit!  Shit!

No.

What are you doing?

Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.

What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.

They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean.

It's real.

Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.

To tell you the truth -- you did.

How was Russia?

Got to follow the paper path here.

Chuck.

Merry Christmas eve.

Four four.  A record.

He is a cute thing.

This isn't working out.

There isn't any us.

I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.

Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.

What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.

Chuck, you're breaking my heart.

I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

What's that?

There was a coffin?

So simple to say, so hard to do.

What will you do?

I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.

When's the next Jumbo?

Really?

Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?

Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...

Kamal is not here.

What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?

Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...

And never take.

A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.

Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?

You were how long on this?

That's what it's about.

As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.

It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...

They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!

These *credentials* are against the law!

He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!

But you've studied with the old man for *years*!

Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?

It's time somebody ate *them*.

So, Mrs...

Where's Mandalay?

A movie *outside*?

But you looked as if you liked it.

First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...

You don't miss it?

Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?

No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.

She won't go to St. Cloud's!

I know.  Is *that* nothing.

Please don't move, don't go anywhere.

Stop it! Just cut it out!

How is that Wally doing?

Hi...

I'm okay--I can walk.

You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!

You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.

Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.

It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.

I wonder if you might give me a ride.

I think I'd probably like the apple business.

"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...

They're migrants.

I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!

I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.

I'm stayin', Homer.

First pregnancy?

I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.

Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.

He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.

Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.

I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?

I don't need this--I know all about my condition.

I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.

Uh... sure.

"One: Please don't smoke in bed."

Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.

Rose Rose?

What's that?

There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.

Give men that. I know how to do it.

You're not yet three months, are you?

But you don't look very happy.

Who cares?

Shit. We don't know what he is.

It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.

You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?

When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.

Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?

You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!

Don't this place look like home?

You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.

Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.

That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!

You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.

Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?

That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.

Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.

Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.

What's this?

Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.

Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?

It's all about the money, isn't it?

I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.

Nice.

Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?

Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?

Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?

We'll take care of it.

Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.

Whoa. What?

Fuck that. We're going too.

Masters of our own destiny.

You know what we're doing with the money.

When?

She up for this?

We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.

Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?

Minus one.

I guess it lacks a certain style.

You can't cheat an honest man.

Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?

Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.

I can't be here! You understand? I can't --

We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.

Mr. King, I think --

You just put a mother of a jinx on us.

Look at you... You want to go.

Do you have something to prove?

I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.

It's more than that.

How do you deal with --

Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.

No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.

You are such a raving pussy sometimes.

What about...

It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.

Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?

But if you wanna talk about bad luck...

I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?

What'd he say?

Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.

Stand up.

Sorry. What?

Still time.

Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.

You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.

This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.

What are you doing?

Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.

I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.

You fucking little shit! You shopped me.

Is that your idea of arithmetic?

Eight-fifty.

Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.

And your lady?

Take it back. Till you sell your book.

You're my prisoner.

It came my way. 450 a week.

You're shaking. What is it?

When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.

Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.

You're my conscience.

What are you doing here?  You know the rules.

I don't like it.

Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.

Without hope there's no point to anything.

It's beautiful. Thank you.

That girl, she works at the casino --

You're entitled to your opinion.

I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...

Here...use a spoon.

How did you hurt your hand?

What happened?

I didn't.

I owe a lot of money.

My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -

The point is, they want a man inside.

Yes.

How are you?

Did you solve your problems?

Detective Inspector Ross.

I'm Lucy.

Where to?

Where do you live, Jack?

I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.

Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.

Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.

Don't worry, I won't report you!

What happened to Bella?

You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.

You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?

Where did you go to school?

There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us.

You use two alternating, don't you?

You want me to check?

Ever?

Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.

This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.

She's not in the gaming business is she?

I just want the job.

I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.

There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --

Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?

Find me something, I don't care where it is.

Fuck that shit.

Rechannel all safety relays --

Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?

Armed.

Hey, bomb...

Well of course I exist.

My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.

This is fun.

Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.

In a second.

Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?

Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.

-- automatic channels open --

I need a diameter approximation.

Must get lonely being up here so much.

Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.

It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...

Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?

Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?

It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.

I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...

Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.

What should we do, sir? The time is running out.

Commander Powell? Commander, hello!

I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.

But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.

Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?

You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--

Man, you got a bad attitude.

I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.

Nothing happened between me and Tia.

Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.

Why would I be pissed?

It's a sweep.  C'mon.

Out there.

Which is none of your business...or mine.

What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.

Same old story.  Not interested.

What're you looking for?

Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.

I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.

I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.

So Max, what do you do with all your money?

No...

Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.

I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.

You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.

You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?

Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.

You got a lotta nerve.

Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.

Am I s'posed to be grateful?

I haven't been able to get you off my mind.

Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?

I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.

I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.

I already don't like the sound of this.

That's low, but this effects me how exactly?

I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.

They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.

Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.

These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.

I'm looking for a lady who works here.

But she does work here?

Look, I don't know what you want--

And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.

This is not a place you wanna go.

You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.

I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.

Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.

Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.

What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?

You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.

I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.

Morning, Sunshine...

A little what?

A fog bank.

You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.

Not right now.

Who are you?

Can you put that in a bag or something?

It's payday, need me to pick up your check?

Playing hooky again?

Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?

You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.

Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.

I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.

I want you on call here.

Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.

What the hell is that?

Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.

Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?

You love him?

And he loves you back, doesn't he?

You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?

Whoa... she is a killer.

Sorry.

Jeremiah?

I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.

We've got to take this slow...

So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?

What are you, high?

Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.

...at twenty-thirty hours.

Any luck?

Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...

We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.

Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?

What the fuck!

Cool, bro, now listen up...

I think we should try sneaking in.

Could be.

Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.

Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.

Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.

It was stolen!

But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.

Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.

Jeremiah, what are you doing?

Yeah.

Well? Continue! Continue!

Trip, you fuckin' asshole.

Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.

Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?

About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.

Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!

Look, you can have my wallet...

Gimme your gun, boy!

I don't even think you have a gun!

Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.

I did?

I feel bad for his family.

A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.

Beg pardon?

That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.

Who is... we?

Where did you come from?

DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!

How old is Grandma Death?

Wanna walk me home?

Don't look so freaked.

Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?

Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.

Where are you going?

That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.

You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...

They suspended me for two days.

Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?

I know she's here. She never leaves the house.

What? How long was I asleep?

I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.

Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.

Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?

You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.

If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.

So how was school today?

And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.

Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?

That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.

What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?

Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.

And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?

How are things going at school?

I asked you about school.

What about your family, Donnie?

Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?

Nothing.

Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...

Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.

So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?

I think now that he might...

Because I'm so horny.

Where are we going, Donald?

How is that possible?

I can see him right now!

It's too late. I've already ruined my life.

So I hear you have a girlfriend.

No I don't.  She worries about you.

It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.

Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.

How much are they paying you to be here?

Our son just called me a bitch.

I didn't realise it was such a big deal.

Christ. Is that an axe?

Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.

Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.

Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.

Kitty...

Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.

What is this shit?

Wicked.

Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!

You're what?!

So, what do I say?

What is wrong with you?

You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.

It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!

All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."

I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.

Amber...

Oh shit!

I hate her!

Here, I didn't get any.

Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck?

And the bite marks on my ears?

So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.

Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?

You don't know where this is gonna...

We was robbed.

Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!

Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.

The bitch.

...You betcha. S'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...

...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."

So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...

This is -- what?

You get nothing, Hank, okay?

I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.

Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.

From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king!

And wear a crown and everything.

Of course you're All aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where I'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong

Here I am, Father.

My dear President...  read it back...

That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.

There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?

Go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building -- Get rid of him if you have to use violence - if necessary call out the militia and if he isn't looking get me a bag of peanuts.

Who to?

Yes -- why?

What kind of a dog is he?

Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.

I don't wanna stick out my tongue.

You get half mine and I get half yours.

I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".

He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.

Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?

Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?

Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.

If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!

I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.

Excellency, may I present my niece.

Give me that again!

How're ya fixed for ammunition?

Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!

Your Excellency!

Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.

If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.

Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?

Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...

Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.

I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.

Oh.  Then there his somebody else?

I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.

Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.

Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.

Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?

Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.

Yes.

You stay with me.

What happened?

He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.

This man belongs in hospital.

I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?

I want him back!

What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.

Don't we?

But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.

Are you comfortable here?

How long has this man been here?

Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.

O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?

Oh, no.

She's very pretty, your mother.

Alas, no.

Romance!

Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

How awful for John.

Is he... dying then?

Want to come out?

I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.

Say hello to London for me. I miss her.

The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!

The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?

Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.

Merrick...

Mmmerrick.

Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?

The hospital?

No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.

My home.

Is it the one you wanted?

Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.

Well...

So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.

WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?

Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.

I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?

So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?

Well... where is he?

WHAT did you say?

What?

WHY?

Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?

No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?

The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.

YOU still want to go to Asgaard?

Do you believe I love you?

The second note.

But --

But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?

Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.

Would you like us to sing to you?

What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?

It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...

He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.

Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!

But it IS! Look!

Looting and pillaging, eh?

It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.

Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.

Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!

I just said I didn't feel like raping you.

Scream.

What are you talking about?

What's wrong with making friends?

That's terrible!

It's not magic! It's just a trick!

Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!

Slower! In... Out...

SHUT UP!

There is another way.

Wait, Erik!

What do you think?

Well, what else do we do?

Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!

But HOW?

Look, I bagged it last week.

You're wasting your time.

Same thing, isn't it?

He used to puke in his sleep.

Let me go, Sven.

Well! Come on!

Can't make enough axe-heads!

My brother blacksmiths!

We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!

There! THAT'S a true Berserk.

Well I'M certainly not, either.

Thorfinn! You can't die!

And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.

And keep your sword greased.

I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.

I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.

Oh, baby, what's going on?

What's wrong with me?

Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.

Really?

Rockville Center.

I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.

I like it.

I'm sure you would.

No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.

Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?

My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.

Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.

Frost?

Thanks.

Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?

Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.

You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.

I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.

So, I enjoyed meeting you.

How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?

What?!

Joely...

What if you hide me?

But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.

I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.

Do you remember what we talked about?

Right. Something black though.

We did talk about Naomi.

I'm sure, I said.

I told her today I need to end it.

Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.

Hi there.

Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.

You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.

I'll give you a couple. See what you think.

I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --

Doesn't sound like me.

You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."

I don't know. Panties and --

How's it going?

That's me.

It was snowing.

The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.

Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.

I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?

Boo.

Stan... c'mon...

See you later, alligator.

Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?

Let him go, Stan. I can help.

It's stopped.

I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...

What do you want, Stan?

Mary...

Thanks.

Okay, we're back in.

Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."

Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.

You made me have an abortion.

You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --

Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?

Jesus. All right, what's the address.

Howard, they've disappeared again.

I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.

This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.

Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.

The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.

She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.

Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.

But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.

Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?

No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.

About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.

That's Jellybean!

Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.

What do you think?

What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.

You're the best?

Ballast.

I can see why they sent you along.

Time to play Spam in the can.

Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --

From what?

What?

Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.

Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...

It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...

Is that an offer?

Let me breathe, let me breathe...

How? The Bridge is gone.

What...?

To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.

Do you hear it? Right there.

DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.

Please... kill...

What's happening...?

You wanted to see me, Admiral?

Does he know that?

...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.

Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.

I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.

Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.

Jesus its huge.

That means they didn't abandon ship.

I found one.

Peters...

Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.

It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.

Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --

It's insane.

It's 2041...

We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.

You said this ship creates a gateway...

What about my ship?

You can't leave. She won't let you.

Your eyes...

If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.

Weir is dead.

What are you?

Then what, what are you? Tell me...

There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.

Jesus...

We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...

1500 meters. We're getting too close...

Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!

But...

I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.

...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...

Sir.

Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.

Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.

Miller...

I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...

What I want is to survive the next ten hours.

What?

Can you see a body?

You got any coffee?

Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...

What the hell is that?

Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...

Miller, do you read me, Peters --

What is it?

Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.

What is it?

Those yours too?

I mean...

He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --

About me? How sweet.

He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."

Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?

What did you wish for, honey?

He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --

I had it at four.

Ben --

Hey! That's a prototype!

No more cracks about how I look.

At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --

Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?

Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.

You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!

Is that what you call it? "Real"?

Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --

Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.

I, uh, think I remember the number.

Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.

Feeling better?

How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?

You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --

You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?

You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --

Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --

It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.

If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.

Please don't make this personal --

I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.

Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.

I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.

Hi, Brad.

Mom says to clean up the pool.

Is everything okay at work?

Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?

Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?

Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!

Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.

Do you have any ice tea?

I think we're making a lot of noise.

Oh. Hi.

Take that back.

You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.

It's definitely your mama.

All right... where did you see her?

I would. Yeah.

I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.

Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.

That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.

Hey, Rat.

Hey, Mark. Is that you?

No. I don't think so. Not right now.

If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?

You're losing it, Damone.

Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.

Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.

Are you Linda Barrett?

Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.

My brother's car!

My brother is gonna shit.

Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.

So what did you do?

Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.

Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.

Just kidding. About 10cc.

You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.

All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'

What do you think?

Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!

Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.

Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!

Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?

I think I've made my point with you tonight.

What's that?

I think I better take you home.

What do you do with the jackets people leave here?

You keep them.

Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.

Aren't your parents asleep?

No. That's okay.

So... pretty nice house you've got here.

Where's Mike today?

What's April 16th?

Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.

Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.

But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?

Let's have lunch!

Certainly, Mr. Duke!

Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...

Killed?

Rum and ice, please.

Naw!

Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.

We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.

What do you mean by that?

Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?

Shoot it.

Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people!

Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?

Jesus creeping shit!

I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.

Yeah... I thought we might need it...

Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.

Jesus.

Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.

You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?

Lucy.

Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.

Read the newspapers.

Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.

No, she's looking for you.

Never mind, it's absolutely pure.

Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens.

...grow claws... bleeding warts.

So do we, lady.

What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!

The airport is over there!

The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."

Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!

Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?

It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.

Careful.

We should go! We should go right now!

I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.

Hey! Get quiet or get out.

HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.

Where's the tunnel?

I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.

Ohhh.

Why do you take shit from him?

We're going to get help.

Doesn't your foot hurt?

How much you got?

How much you got to see the show?

What? Really?

Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.

What do you mean what?

What's going on between you two?

What's it for!?

Four door?

I'll go with ya.

Clever fuckers.

'Eh, Chief?

Fine, Chief.

You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.

Move it!

JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!

COME ON!

Yeah, maybe.

Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?

Let's go.

Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!

Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.

Her name is Charlie.

She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.

Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.

Frances?  Oh no.

Excuse me, sir?

Oh. I mean, good.

I guess so, sir.

That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.

You know what I mean.

That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.

Face it! Confess it! You're weak!

Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house...  her bedroom. I can't ask you to...

Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...

Hello, Harold.

You don't think I'm good enough?

But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!

What does Clifford say?

Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?

Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?

Get your clothes on.

Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?

I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.

The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!

...Don't you?

No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.

Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.

New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!

...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?

Thank you, Ralph.

I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.

An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.

You wrote it, didn't you?

I know that, Dad, but --

But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?

Francie, you know I can't do that.

You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --

Address?

Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.

Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.

I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.

What?

I know what ability you're interested in.

Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.

How the hell do you find me anyway?

This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...

Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.

Why are you always leaving me, Harry?

You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.

You give up on her?

Anyway... if you need me...

I love you, Harry. I love you.

Where to?

Right. Except... time has a way of --

C'mere. I want to talk to you.

Oh, you...  ...ennh.

Pretty morning.

And no people.

Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?

Yeah.

Shit!

Did you expect him to look you up?

I live here.

That's me, Clifford.

How's it sound?

I don't want you drinking, Frances.

Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.

No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!

I don't believe so.

I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.

Thanks are hardly necessary.

Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?

Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.

Normal. Average.

Is there something else?

No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.

Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.

You what?

Symington says...

Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?

I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.

It can't be as bad as that.

More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?

In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.

What can I do?

Friend?

Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.

What is this?

Must've been a terrible row.

I should go. I should leave today.

What does it say?

Have you seen Willie?

What kind of God is He to will this?

Smell the air. Wonderful.

Brother and sister still?

I've no choice

I thought I'd never see you again!

I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.

I am not mad.

The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.

Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.

That's blasphemy!

Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.

All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.

Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.

You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.

To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.

Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.

How is it you come to be here?

Your men are right to be afraid.

We should go now.

What'd you see?

I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.

Good night, Alice.

Alice? The others show up?

Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?

And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.

Trouble?

It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.

I don't hear it anymore.

Where?

It's dead. Try the pay phone.

I'll be along.

Sure.

You know what I said, though.

I wouldn't know.

Claudette...

Give me a hand?

I'll be okay. Holy shit...

You just had some lucky shots.

What hath God wrought?

Ha!

Ow!

Just a walk, for Chrissakes.

What about Neddy?

Don't call him.

Are you wet?

It's beautiful...

Cowboy.

Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...

I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.

How much do I owe you?

What was that?

You said it was just you and your son.

No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.

Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?

Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?

What's this guy's problem?

If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.

What about Kate?

Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.

Why did they block the door again?

Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.

Not a chance.

If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.

Yes.

Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?

How'd she die?

Died instantly?

I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.

Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?

Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.

I'm telling you, don't hurt her.

I don't have the slightest idea.

Then?

Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?

I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.

I promise.

It's the bitterest of pills.

There's nothing wrong with this place.

It has a bed. That's all I care about.

You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?

I promise.

I'm going for 'em!

What's going on?

You're gonna let us go?

For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.

Hot goddamn day!

Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.

Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?

Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?

What dya mean?

Start the car.

Do they have an X-rated channel?

I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?

Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.

Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?

Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?

What does that mean?

Keep your voice down.

Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.

Far out.  Where are my glasses?

What do you mean?

Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?

How are you?

In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.

I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a man."

Got it.

Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?

Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --

None at this time, sir.

No, sir, WHAT?

Straight up?

Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not --

Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...

Ah, c'mon...

Hardly the case, Senator.

"Coronado."

Can't complain, ma'am.

Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --

Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent.

Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.

Close as I can get, el-tee!

Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three...

Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.

Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.

Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?

Chances of recovery?

So why're you even considering it? Are you?

Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?

Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?

Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.

Wick.  They got your crew, too?

At first.

Sorry, didn't mean to --

Do you, uh, know...

'Cool?

Chief, sir, I don't understand why --

Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?

Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?

O'Neil...

You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.

Thought you two were file-closed.

Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.

Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?

That's cuz I'm married to you.

Who the hell are all these people?

Where's Audrey?

You okay?

What are you doing?

You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.

So, you still picking apart cockroaches?

That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.

Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.

My life sucks.

I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.

Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.

Can I use some?

Just tell me, did you talk with him?

Hence the radiation.

Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.

CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.

You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.

That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.

The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.

No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.

We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.

Are you looking for this?

I need you to trust me.

I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.

It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.

What's with the chewing gum?

Who the hell are you?

Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...

I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?

Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.

Come on, old friend...

I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...

God, what an ass.

Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...

~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?

Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...

He wants to THINK!?

What's happened?

A boy comes to the door.

WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!

Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."

He always has to make the big entrance.

He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!

... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-

Go. They're off again.

That's It?

Systems register functional.

U.... What do you think?

Covalent... Right. So...

You Okay, Alex?

It's suicide.

Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.

Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?

Your last name.

More to the left... Stay parallel...

"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.

But I'm the Commander!

Hey... Hey where are you going?

All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.

I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'

All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.

What?  What did he say?

Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?

So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?

There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!

We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?

You gotta admit, they do love him.

That's it, It's go time.

We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.

First, I require the Omega 13... Second-

Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...

Wait. What did you say?

Explain -

My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.

Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.

Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...

Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?

You... You mean Earth?

An interstellar vox.

Weapons storage...

To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.

Mathesar? What is that?

A thousand apologies. We have failed you.

Sorry Guys... It just went off.

Continue forward, sir?

Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?

Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.

Arnold!

Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.

Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!

I hope I never have to believe that.

After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table...

Well, George, who were you?

What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?

What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?

Who is that!?

We've got powder but no ball!

That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.

What are we going to do?

What is this?

What's your advice, Alexander?

Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.

Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.

With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.

If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!

They are... friends of Congress.

Oh, come now...

Partially...

Did God ever make such a pitiful army?

No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.

Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!

If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.

Colonel Reed...

Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress...  Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?

'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?

What is it, Marquis?

The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.

That's right...

To win this war I need an army.

What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?

I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.

The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!

What the hell are we doing?

Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.

Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?

What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?

Then why are you teaching me...?

You're out of your mind!

They can use their imaginations.

And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...

William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.

Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.

I guess still in the locker.

You see the paper?

After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.

What about him?

Trade for what?

What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?

Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.

I think I pulled my quadriceps.

About sixty.

You gave him the money?

Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?

Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.

You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.

I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.

Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.

No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?

I need the money.

You know Laurel Canyon?

I'm working on a few things.

He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?

I don't know.

Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?

Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?

What?

How'd you get in here?

Who the fuck are you?

You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.

Have we met? I don't recall.

A marker's like a check, Harry.

Come on, Harry - Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.

You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.

Keep going.

Part of it, yeah.

I'm not the guy, Harry.

I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.

I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.

These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal - this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer -

You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?

Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.

The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.

That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -

You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'

You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.

That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.

Is he giving you a check or cash?

Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.

It was in the Herald.

Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.

You mean like we don't give a shit.

I'm thinking of a movie.

How about this?

I turn it on when I confront the guy.

No, it was open. It wasn't locked.

The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?

Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?

Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.

That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?

You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.

I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.

I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -

Why not?

You sure?

You okay?

Were you scared up there?

You don't act like it?

What took you so long?

Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.

No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.

He already knew it.

Whatta you doing out there?

Yeah, but whose point of view?

Yeah? What three words, Harry?

So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.'

What a spectacular view.

Yeah, what'd he have to say?

What's wrong?

When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.

The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.

Lufkin. His... agent.

Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.

Roger, North Island. I am tied to the passenger vessel Chimera. And she is afloat. Repeat, she is afloat. Over.

Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.

How about now?

Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.

Let's not be too hasty.

Roger.

Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?

What other choices have we got?

Maybe that is his boat.

One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.

Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?

I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?

Did you?

Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.

The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.

How much longer's that gonna take?

I know I know, two ways to do anything --

We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.

Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.

Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.

Bodies're too fresh.

Dodge to Murphy.

Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!

What the fuck -- ?

We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.

Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.

Don't fall asleep.

Morning everybody.

Then why didn't they take it.

What'd he look like?

Stay away. Or else.

Any dizziness?

I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.

I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.

Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.

So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.

Guess that'd be me. Again.

You just shoot at something?

"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."

It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.

What do you think happened on this boat?

The what?

What do we do with him?

Murphy, don't you see what's happening?

Too deep to anchor out there.

Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.

All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.

How much you figure that's worth, skipper?

Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.

What now?

Pretty low all around.

Never been more thirsty in my life.

We're still drifting.

As I said, what seems to be the trouble?

Will you get off my back for once?

Pumpkin? What's wrong?

Pumpkin, are you in there?

What do you mean "on his way up"!?

Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...

I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!

What are you trying to say?

Who is this, Enid?

Hmm.

The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --

Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.

I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.

Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?

Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.

That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.

Jesus, look at this guy.

What do you mean "why"?

Nothing.

You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!

You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...

Oh, hi...

This is so bad, it's almost good.

Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.

Did you sign up yet?

Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.

Hey - why do you have this?

You know, the green cardigan guy.

You call.

He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.

What should we do? What if he recognizes us?

That was truly pathetic.

"Funky"?

That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.

There he is...

Ew ... when did you get that?

It's a surprise.

That guy is totally amazing.

God, how can you stand all these assholes?

But those are our people...

...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.

Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!

Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?

Now are you going to get a regular job?

I think one of us should fuck Josh...

I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...

Look, we have to get these...

How repulsive!

What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?

I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.

I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.

I dunno...

Do you want anything?

Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!

I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer!

May I ask what you're doing?

I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!

A what?

How much is this?

Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.

I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...

Punk rock is over!

Oh, how "punk."

Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.

That's five hundred dollars.

Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.

This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue.

Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?

Oops! I dropped it!

I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!

I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!

Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!

But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?

What did you tell that girl?

Jesus...

What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?

"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!

Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.

So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?

Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...

Aren't you going to get that?

No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?

Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?

Just someone so young...

I... I don't think so.

I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...

What are you doing here?

Uh... sure... come in.

That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --

I hate sports.

What about Joe?

You know what my number one fantasy used to be?

I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?

It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.

God, Dana's going to kill you!

Yeah, well... me neither...

Well, here's where the fun never stops!

Maybe she's got another boyfriend.

Please Josh?

I agree.

Did you remember to pay the phone bill?

I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?

Talk to us about it...

I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?

Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?

I don't know.

I have no idea - I just want to...

Really, I don't know enough about it to...

What do you mean?

What are you talking about?

Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.

It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...

Thank you, doctor.

You were contracted to work-

-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-

No hints, Samuel.

Starting now, we attack them.

-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?

You'll need your confidence, I promise you.

I do need to see Starling.

It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-

In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.

I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.

This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer.

I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.

Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-

Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.

We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.

John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-

All right- thee second embankment will go there. 

In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.

Second death? Where?-

I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.

...misfire... it jammed...

They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.

I'll be bait alone?

Why do the workers look unhappy?

I am also liaison between these two.

Soon. 

Why so many?

Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now.  You two will sleep beautifully in your tents.  And stay there.

We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?

What do you want with my baby?

Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.

Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.

What are you working on, Egon?

Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.

This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?

Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.

No, you didn't, Frank.

I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.

So this is what you do, huh?

I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?

Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?

Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.

They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?

Does she know anything about babies?

All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?

According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.

Can I help you?

I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?

I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?

You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?

I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.

Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.

The witness is leading him.  Sustained.

Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.

Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.

I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.

Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.

This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.

Six feet -- seven -- eight --

It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.

Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --

Who?

You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?

And now you're going to eat it?

Like a goat on garbage.

What kind of tests?

Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?

I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.

My Fault!

Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.

My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.

Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.

Now that's one ugly dude.

Are you all right?

Aren't you glad we waited?

Roy?  Your clock broke.

We're all professionals here, Miss ...

There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.

Who's the stiff?

You must have gotten the last copy.

Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?

He is the Destructor.

This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.

But why?  The students love us!

Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.

Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.

Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.

Great!  How's it going?

And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?

Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?

What on earth gave you that idea?

Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.

Trust me.  It will be bad.

He wants to shut down the storage grid.

What now?

No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!

I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.

What happened??!!!?

What do you mean by "seen?"

Anything!  Just make contact.

Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.

But most people are afraid to even report these things.

I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.

Ray -- Something's here.

It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.

I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!

Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.

You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.

Stantz?  You okay in there?

More wine, sister?  Surely you can drink more than that.

Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?

Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...

Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.

But they're not destroyed, not yet.

You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.

Where is my family?

Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?

Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!

So am I.

Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.

It's because he comes off as the underdog.

Where is my father?

"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.

So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...

I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.

Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.

My loyalties... were in doubt.

I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.

Where are they?

If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!

The Senators admire you.

As soon as I can.

Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.

Serious stuff...

You brought the army into Rome.

Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!

He's very realistic.

What about their philosophy lessons?

You're not going!  You have to stay with us!

Narcissus!

You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?

Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!

No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!

They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...

Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.

Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.

You're living at home now. Is that right?

Aren't you eating?

I think I'd better go home now please.

I want to go home.

Listen -- could you stop crying, please?

Benjamin -- do they know you?

I'm sorry. That is not my business.

Yes.

What is it?

What?

Elaine --

No -- don't cry --

The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?

Is that him over there?

Where did he say he was going to meet you?

But you're not enrolled.

-- really incredible --

Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...

Don't tell me --

Can I just sit here while you're packing?

Benjamin?

You won't?

How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --

Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.

I just don't think it would work.

Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?

Carl who?

Well, what did he say? I'm curious.

Are we getting married tomorrow?

Benjamin?

657-2036

This is Dr. Smith's answering service.

Ben.

What's that?

You're not one of those agitators?

Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.

It's all right, Mr. McCleery.

See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.

Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?

Mrs. Robinson?

Can I help you, sir!

Yes sir?

Is there an ashtray in here?

In general.

Will you take me home?

You don't?

Thank you.

What do you think of me?

Did you know that?

I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.

It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.

No.

I don't remember her as having brown eyes.

Yes?

Thank you.

Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?

Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?

I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.

Do you want to?

But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --

Yes -- I think that would be good.

What?

Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.

Oh -- yes. Wood?

Thank you.

All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.

Do you really want me to?

Do you want to hear it or not?

How do you get out of the house?

What do you say to him?

But what about the noise from the car. What if --

But you don't hate him.

I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?

But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.

A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!

Don't talk about Elaine.

I wish you'd tell me.

I have my reasons.

We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --

Well, I'm not.

That I'm a sick and disgusting person.

Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.

I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.

Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.

I don't believe you.

Hello. Get me the police, please.

I'm afraid I don't understand.

I drive around.

I do.

You believe me, don't you?

When did you two talk this over?

She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.

Thank you very much, sir.

Sir?

In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.

That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.

Hello.

Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?

I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.

No, I don't.

Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.

Yes?

I'm having luck for the first time in my life.

And what are you going to do?

No -- no -- no -- no...

Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...

Reducing?

Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?

What?

That was lovely.

Yes -- I'd love to.

Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.

Yes -- tired...

Strange man...

Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --

What can you see?

So --

I'll give you what you need -- I have money.

Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?

You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.

I can't.

No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...

Then you know him?

I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.

A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?

All right then.

Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.

Oh -- good evening, Baron.

It's always so quiet here.

Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.

Oh, let the poor devil alone.

Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --

And the child isn't coming?

Telegrams?

Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --

A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...

You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.

Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?

You must look at my face and not at the floor.

You're trembling.

You loved the Baron, didn't you?

Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.

How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?

What...! --

A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him.

Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --

No.

Cotton Company --

Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.

I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.

Yes.

You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --

Insolent young cub!

Come here. 

Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.

Oh, no.

I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.

And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.

Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.

Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.

Sorry, Preysing. 

See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.

How clear is Manchester?

Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.

Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.

Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --

Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.

Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.

Take them back, Suzette.

It is time for the performance.

Last night?... There was no applause.

Good morning, Pimenov.

You may go, Mr. Kringelein.

What is this insolence?

Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.

What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.

Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.

I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.

What do you want with her?

Hi, Bobo.

Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.

How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?

I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.

No.

Permanent damage.

He's a good kid. A salesman.

Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.

I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.

Want a look?

Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.

Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.

I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.

What's up?

You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.

Sounds like a good Idea.

See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?

A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.

They knocked out my tooth!

Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?

Lucky? You call that lucky?

I tripped over a chair.

Why?

Roy, I don't want money from you.

After the meet. Back to Baltimore.

I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.

It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --

Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.

You want a drink?

You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.

You're getting off the grift?

Well, uh...

Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?

I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?

Look at me.

Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.

Big spender.

Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.

What?

Is that right?

He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.

Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.

Yeah?

You were gone for a while.

) The track? Did you run into Lilly?

She didn't see you, in other words.

You must have some very knowledgeable friends.

Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?

I don't think I need it.

That's what I say.

What I say is, no. We don't do partners.

Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.

What's that?

Do you have any particular reason to say that?

Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?

What?

Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.

One set of muddy shoe prints.

Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.

I can be real stiff.

Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.

Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.

Funny, we just drove right in.

Do you know who did this?

Jimmy, what are you doing?

I promise not to run off to Cancun.

Where are you going?

You some kind of fugitive or something?

Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?

Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...

Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.

Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.

Better?

Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?

Linda!  He killed Linda!

Hey, you alright?

Who?

I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.

Look, they're staring right at us.

Wait.

I have to pee.

Ooooh, busted.

I'll pop a Benadryl.

Guess they -- went to the fair after all.

Mom, I want to go to the fair ...

Mommy, I'm scared.

Promise?

He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.

This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.

God ... this can't be true.

God, what's wrong with him?

Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.

Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!

Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.

It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.

What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?

She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.

I'm sorry, but do I know you --

What do you know about Michael?

A bitch.

Um.

Home.

You know what gets me?

How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.

Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!

What'll you do for transportation?

When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.

I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.

How short the skirts are.

And how were things?

Otherwise, how are things?

I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.

What's funny about that?

You told me.

When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.

Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.

Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.

You know her for what she is now-- garbage.

I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?

I know you think that.

Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.

I forgot my vacuum cleaner.

Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.

Blue soup.

Would somebody please pass me the catsup?

Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.

Anybody home?

Hello.

You think you could find me a pencil and paper?

And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?

Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?

What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?

Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.

We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.

The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.

You're a very good boy to respond that way.

Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!

Why don't you go to bed--son.

Can I get dressed first?

A hundred dollars for breakfast?

No.

Mom?

Of course it is.  Is it loaded?

Gee whiz, Dad--

Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?

Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!

"Hamburger Heaven."

Like hugging a lamp post.

What's that all about?

Your old beau?

Please--

We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.

You used to like it stark!

I have some change!

Breakfast?

Which one?

Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!

Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.

Let me guess--breakfast is served?

What then?

You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!

Tell me about its sexual roots.

Go on.

He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.

I came for Paul as well.

Did you like it, dear?

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.

Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!

No.

Help your mother find the bullet.

Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?

Ooops.

The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?

But here you are inside, aren't you?

We tried to be.  We tried to be.

Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.

Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.

I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.

Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!

Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.

Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.

Pacqualinincheewa root.

Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.

It died for your sins.

What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.

You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?

I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."

You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?

Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.

I'm going to shoot you now.

Don't shoot.

Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?

Alice is dead?

You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?

You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.

Thank God!

Oh, Paul--

You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?

Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.

A lot of people don't.

Where will you be?

Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?

Mom?

I don't get it.

What does he say to do?

We don't have a maid any more.

I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.

He'd assume we had.

Yes?

I'm touched.

What then?

Is he coming home?

For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.

Did you talk to Paul?

A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--

You were wonderful.

I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.

This is very good for us.

The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.

We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?

What kind of a life is that?

Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.

They didn't murder me.

That's been said before.

Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.

It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.

Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.

You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.

Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.

We're going to have jackets, aren't we?

I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.

Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?

What do you mean?

Now, what do you want?

Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.

Is this all the display space we can get?

Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.

Yeah.

You making a feature?

No. I saw her with Tod.

No.

And your wife? Where's she?

You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you.

Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?

Is that the way it was with you?

Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.

Neither am I.

I don't see why I must justify myself to you. I don't care about the things you do. I don't care what's happening in New York or Los Angeles. I don't care about movies or TV. I don't care who's on Johnny Carson.

They were here?

Yeah, yeah, go on.

I can stop if you want.

More or less.

Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.

Look, I really don't know your daughter but...

She left you right?

Granville?

Did you find out where she was?

As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.

Mast?

I don't know.

I don't know.

Yeah. Probably.

You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?

What happened, pilgrim?

You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?

Wes, do me a favor.

Hey man.

God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.

She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.

You wait here. I'll find out where she is.

Where's Ratan?

That film was a fake! Everything's phony...

You don't want anything for your fifty cents?

Not exactly...

What's that?

What does that do?

Maybe. Maybe not.

Huh?

I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.

He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.

Yes.

Your tree.

Lady, let me get this straight.

Check.

What do you want?

Eh, no.

It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.

Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?

But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?

Sort of.

Do you often model for Glaucus?

Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?

Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.

Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.

We'll transplant it. To the forest.

A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?

What's that?

Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.

You are the wisest person I know.

Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.

Maude, do you pray?

No. I'd feel stupid.

How about some candy floss?

Do you think there is any life up there?

Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.

Why are there no photographs in these frames?

... which I hope will make you very happy.

Please, don't you realize? She is dying.

I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.

Would you like a cigarette?

And why is that?

Just give me a rough estimate.

I put a lot of effort into these things.

And a lot of time.

No.

Harold?

None at all?

Why?

What would you say?

The moment of truth.

How about hand-to-hand combat?

To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.

Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.

Parasite!

Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?

Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?

Yes.

It's different for us.

You knew?

Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!

It's coming.

The box. I need the box.

What?

You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...

What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?

I... remember.

Steve...

Who?

I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --

harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --

What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --

Do you believe in hell?

These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.

Don't look! Turn around.

They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.

Where am I -- exactly, Sir?

Who's the squirt?

Got tired of me?

It is. You got yourself on TV again.

Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.

They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.

He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --

Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --

Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?

She's dead.

You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.

"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.

We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --

You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.

Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.

I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.

What are you, a Boy Scout?

Anything else you --

Are you sure about this?

You're going alone?

Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.

That you feel that way about me.

Hit me.

Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.

The box... you opened it. We came.

Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.

This isn't for real.

We want the man who did this --

Just in time.

Please. Get back into bed.

You remember.

Don't touch me. Or so help me --

Come to Daddy.

Bastard.

I'm brother Frank.

A long time.

You can't love him.

So where's the harm?

She'll tell them everything...

That's probably her now. Or the police.

Don't you care?

What happened?

It smells damp.

Not exactly modern.

I thought half of it was your brother's?

No argument.

Larry!

Where are you?

Well?

You're NOT going to faint.

Take it slowly.

Julia?

Are you all right?

Maybe a brandy.

Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?

-- I'll go see.

Larry...

Plain soda?

Oh Christ.

Who's there?

Well I want you to see the house.

Great.

It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?

I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.

It's like she's waiting for something.

No you don't.

We're on the Cointreau.

I'm here.

All right.  No. That's nice.

Oh!

I've been better.

These THINGS... they want to take me --

What did I say?

Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.

You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.

Yeah.

What did you tell her about the shop for?

Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.

Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.

I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.

I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?

Shut the fuck up, Barry.

The band that found me and asked me to join.

Isn't it?

Fuck off, Barry.

The little skate-fuckers.

What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.

110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.

Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.

I'm looking for a record for my daughter.  For her birthday.  "I Just Called To Say I Love You." Do you have it?

Great.  Can I have it then?

What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --

It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --

Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?

Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?

What?

He's got one!

I can't go to the club tonight, guys.

Don't do it, Rob!

Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...

Uh.  That's me.

Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.

Is that it?

Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.

Hey Charlie.

It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more.  In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.  Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.  And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself?  Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.  A little sunnier.  Sparkier.  I don't know.  You know what people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation.

No, that's okay.  Really.

Are you all right?

Laura?  Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.

You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.

Shit!

Are you coming home?

Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!

Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?

What's the obvious stuff?

Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.

Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.

Is it better?

Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?

Never?

I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?

Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.

Is that why you wanted to see me?

You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.

We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.

Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --

I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.

He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.

Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.

You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.

Ray.  I hate Ian.

I guess I am.

I'm sorry.

Do you want me to be there?

Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?

Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.

What?

You know, with Ray...

Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.

More confident, maybe.

Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?

Hi.

I called Dan Koretzky because he --

No.  Probably not.

Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?

Rob here.

What's happenin'.

Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"

So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?

Enough, Liz.

Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?

You share a place with T-Bone?

What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.

Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.

That way.

She left.  She's gone.

I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?

And after that?

It must have taken him a long time to get them together.

That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.

Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?

Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.

It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.

I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.

How old is Richard?

He'd want to know about all this.

Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...

Figured you knew more about swords than I did.

You're very macabre.

Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.

I have friends.

What will you do now?

He was innocent.

No.  I had to talk to you.

Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.

There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?

No.  So what now?  We just wait?

I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.

But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.

What's wrong?

Get out.

Life.  It is the gift and the under- standing of life.

But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.

You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.

What were you doing in Felton?

Aye.

Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?

Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.

Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.

You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.

You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.

I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.

No doubt.

Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.

Complete your inspection?

We must talk.

He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.

Spare a chair?

How did you find me?

And have you something to settle with me?

But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?

I knew his great-grandfather.

Friend of yours?

Tradition.

Did you know the victim?

What were _you_ looking for?

A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?

Ah Steven, it is good to see you.

Morning Mr. North

Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.

Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.

Bensinger -- of the Tribune.

Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.

Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.

Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?

I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.

I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?

I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!

The five hundred? Sure.

All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?

That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.

I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.

Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.

No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.

Oh, she was here.

You're Bruce Baldwin?

Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --

Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?

I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.

How long would the interview take?

I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.

I don't know. This makes me feel funny.

I feel I ought to take care of her.

Well, I'm independent, too.

Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?

Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.

There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.

Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?

No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.

What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?

Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.

Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!

Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --

It's a good, honest business, isn't it?

Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.

Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.

Thanks...

How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!

What tricks would I pull?

We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?

All the words you've got.

Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?

Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!

Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.

Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!

Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?

Don't tell me -- was she killed?

It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.

Look at me, Hildy --

If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!

Ring that number, will you?

Don't open that!

No, you don't! Walter!

Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?

We've certainly been in some swell jams.

Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.

Well -- what is it?

Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.

Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.

What!

But, Hildy -- I can explain --

And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!

How much?

Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.

Are you gentlemen all through with me?

Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?

Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.

Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?

She looks as though she's going to come to.

No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.

I'll call.

What a chase!

Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.

All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.

Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --

No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.

I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.

After all I've done for you --

I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?

Did you actually give Williams that gun?

I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.

Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.

Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!

All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.

Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.

A sight for sore eyes!

Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.

Got you, Williams!

And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?

Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.

Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.

You know it is!

Hildy, I thought you were gone --

Mother!

Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?

Quiet, Mollie, quiet!

Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.

What good'll it do?

Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you. 

They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!

Hey --

What do you want?

Who? Me?

Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.

No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!

This puts me in a peculiar hole.

Is it hard?

Get out of here!

Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right. 

What's he want?

The door was locked.

That was a googly!

You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.

Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?

What are you doing here? This is our territory

My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."

You want to join our gang?

They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.

Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.

But Dad, It's the News.

Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.

Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.

Why not?

I don't understand. Is there any point to it?

You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.

We all had to write a last letter home.

We don't know anything about it

What are you going to be then?

And where do you think you're going?

I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.

You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.

What did he say?

...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.

It was the best time of his life.

Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.

Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?

I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?

God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor.

Molly!

Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.

Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?

Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.

The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.

Drink up, it's party time.

Who's your Daddy!

Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.

Which way?

OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.

Don't worry, I'll be right back.

How much further?

Christ, you scared the shit out of me.

He left!

So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?

Mmmmm, this is tasty.

What the hell are you laughing about?

You mean John Wayne?

If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.

Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.

Yeah.

Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.

She looks like she stinks.

Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.

Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.

Hey, he moved.

This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.

Drive through it!

Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.

What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?

How's about you give me those same directions.

I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky, love June.

Fascinating.

Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?

Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.

This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.

Aw, come on. It will be fun.

Hey, maybe she knows where this is?

Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?

Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.

Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.

I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.

Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?

Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.

God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.

Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.

Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.

What was that?

Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.

Oh, right.

And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.

For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.

I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.

Please, just a minute.

Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.

We gotta break it open.

Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.

Don't worry, we'll find her.

I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.

Harold! Tell the boy again.

Let's go eat, I'm starved.

No. Don't be silly. It's just...

Thank you so much for accompanying me.

Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.

I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.

Gabby, what is it?

Fine.

Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.

The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.

Please. Just one minute of your time.

Well, I think...

I've moved on.

Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.

I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.

My apologies, madam.

Very well.

We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.

You what?

You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.

I don't get that. Is that sexual?

Loves animals. Loves you.

Yeah?

No. I married a midget.

Yeah. My brother told me.

Done!

And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.

I'll be in touch.

Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.

I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.

It looks wonderful.

Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...

I'm sorry?

No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.

You really enjoy my company?

It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...

What are you doing in there?

I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.

It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!

Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?

You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?

I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.

Actually, I just had an amusing thought.

Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?

...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...

What are you doing in there?

Who from work?

It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.

Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.

That's great. It's a great color for you.

Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...

How's work?

I think he's ready.

And what did you do tonight, honey?

Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.

Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.

Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.

I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?

It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.

Yes.

Comin' in or goin' out?

What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?

Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.

And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?

Could be.

We'll be there.

That seems a shame. The night is young.

Will you take a check, Bert?

Hey, mister.

Make it twenty.

I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?

Poker's not your game.

Pool.

First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.

I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.

Hello, Eddie.

Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?

No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.

Thinking about what?

He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.

You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.

So does Eddie.

Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!

Maybe. You want to play?

He's my partner.

You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!

You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.

How do you feel?

In the gut, I mean.

How much we got?

No, it isn't, Charlie.

The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.

You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --

Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.

Just like that?

I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.

I thought we came here to play pool.

Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a cue?

Hi.

It's the lights. And the scotch.

I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.

Fifth of scotch?

Why?

I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.

I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.

Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.

What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?

Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.

I'm hungry.

What did all this stuff cost you?

Don't you ever cook anything?

Oh, cut my finger.

Eddie, what's in that case?

You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too?  What happens, Eddie?

Who is it?

Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.

I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.

Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.

Sherry.  Very old, very dry.

What is it, Eddie?

For how long?

Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.

Where's Bert?

If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.

Go on back to the hotel.

Now and then. You know how it is.

Boy, he is great! Jeez, that old fat man. Look at the way he moves. Like a dancer.

Your shot.

Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.

I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --

Yes.

Why don't you start with me?

What choice did I have -- ?!

Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.

Humans.

You want me to stay?

Do you still want me to stay?

Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?

Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?

I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?

I surrender --

Need some gas?

Bathroom?

I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.

A meteorite, Dad, look!

I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.

Is that all he said?

Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.

Mr. Gardner, I --

No one comes here after dark.

Don't go in.

What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?

George, where have you been?

Hi.  Sorry I'm late.

Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?

This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.

This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.

In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.

You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?

Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.

I don't know how you put up with him.

Did you try to switch to transponder channels?

Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...

A countdown to what?

What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.

You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?

Not listed, huh?

You try Martin?

Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?

Pops, you're a genius!

Thanks, Pops.

Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?

General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.

Any news on my wife?

Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?

And our forces?

Grey, you read me?

Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.

Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.

More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.

That's impossible...

You can't go. Call them back.

Be careful.

Dick-weed!

You're late.

You're late.

Dick-weed.

So, what do you do for a living?

And when the dancing's over? What about your future?

Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.

That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.

Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.

Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.

Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?

Why did you people come here?

My reputation precedes me.

Yes.

Venice, Italy!

But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.

The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?

Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.

Schneider?

Are you expected?

This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.

Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.

"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."

The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.

An old man's dream.

Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.

Fraulein -- will you permit me?

I usually don't either.

My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.

Bingo.

Except he's lost, and I'm not.

Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.

The Ark of the Covenant.

It must be one of these...

What's that?

Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?

What are you going to do?

This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.

You did!!

I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.

And the chair.

What?

Dad!

Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.

Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.

Marcus would agree with me.

That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?

Well, I'm as human as the next man.

A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.

You left just when you were becoming interesting.

Now, who are all these people?

"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."

The penitent man is humble before God.

Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!

Ready?

That car belonged to my brother-in- law.

Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?

Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!

Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot.

The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.

Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?

Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.

I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.

You have insulted my son.

What's that?

What does it mean, Indy?

This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.

Come one, what's wrong?

Let up on the brake!

On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.

You will find them when you find sivlalinga.

Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!

You don't look very good.

What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!

Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!

India...

Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.

What?!

Can you move your arm?

Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.

Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!

Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!

I'd like to find one of those myself.

Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...

It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.

That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!

Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.

There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!

Wait -- what're you doing?

I want to go home...

I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.

What're we going to do?!

I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.

Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.

Where are you,...Al?

...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus

You're in my head...

You're in my head? You don't know my name?

Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.

Do me a favor, Al.

Who are you?

Yeah...Who?

I told you, my name is Al.

What are you doing?

Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?

No they won't.

Anyone there?

Behind us?

Calm Down! Act rational.

I don't know...To get Al.

JOE Or what?

They could put you back in the tube..

Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.

What do you mean we.

I did. I brought you back here.

Now what.

Just walk down the hall?

You need ID in there?

I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.

Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.

You mean...just leave.

What about money?

I don't have any.

It's illegal.

It's just not enough.

Do you notice anything.

Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?

Al, are you doing anything in there?

She doesn't seem to understand.

Help me out, will you?

You really like that shirt?

Much too blue.

You're not just after this girl, are you?

Which one?

Just don't show fear.

You're doing great with her.

What Happened?

She's got the most beautiful...s

No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?

Some agent you are.

Sapporo..

Where are you going?

I can't...

Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.

What was it? What'd I say?

He hung us up dry.

Dieter!

Do something.

I can always flush you down the toilet.

Awwww...

Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.

In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.

Doesn't matter.

I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.

What is your name?

We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?

I'm against it.

In him?

You've cut your hair?

PEM115!

Surveillance Cameras?

Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.

What Job?

What are you doing here, where've you been?

It is to me too.

Your memory.

It may have been affected.

Fine. You look fine.

Well...

We're here.

Don't you want to get out?

Take the card.

Sue who?

What?

Oh...and who is it!?

I'll be right there.

Dinner...tonight.

Let you leave without it.

Can I help?

And how'm I doing?

No. Ryuji just hires us.

To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.

Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?

He didn't.

You're leaving.

Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?

The most important one. Can you help me find him?

What's Gruner like?

Who was?

This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.

How?

If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?

Why'd you ask him.

That's not this direction. It's back the other way.

Why not?

What happened?

What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.

What a mess.

I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.

Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you

He can't help us.

Yeah...I have to get away.

Must be a fulfilling occupation.

Excuse me?

Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.

Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.

That's alright. Just tear it apart.

Screw the PEM...What about Al...

Look, nobody knows we did it.

Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.

Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.

I'll take some.

Hey, baby. What's wrong?

Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?

And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?

Sure.

I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...

Do you want more rice?

You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!

What caliber is my gun?

Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.

Mike... Mike... Mike...

Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"

How prominent? What kind of placement?

There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?

Thank you, Bob.

My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --

Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. 

What?!

...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...

Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...

No shit.

Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...

So, is everything okay?

It went great in Mississippi, Mike.

I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.

Mike... in my...

That Canada story? Still interest you?

C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end...

Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.

Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?

Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?

What do...

How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?

And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.

Seven dwarfs?

Why?

Good. But Jeff...

You attract a crowd.

Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?

That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?

You manipulated me into this...!

Where are you, anyway?

Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!

Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.

Object!

Is that a threat?

Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --

Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.

-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.

Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.

I don't need it.

It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.

Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.

Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.

He's the wrong man.

Is she Asian?

Marylin! What have I done?

Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?

So who'd you hire?

Well. He said to "make the house mine."

How nice.

I assume this is on Rex?

I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.

"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"

Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.

No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.

I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.

I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.

More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.

Hello?

Marylin? When did I say...?

Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --

You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?

No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?

Apparently she was very disappointed.

We're damaged goods.

I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.

I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.

No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.

No.

Honey, I could sit...

Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --

I have a surprise for you.

Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!

Comfy!

Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?

I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?

Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.

Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...

You're forgetting Howard Doyle?

Income tax evasion?

Do you need a Tagamet?

Is this a lover?

She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.

Maybe.

Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.

That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.

What?

-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.

You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.

Herb wants to see me?

He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --

...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.

So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?

What's Kirshner?

She could buy and sell you ten times over.

Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.

Hi, Sweetie.

No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.

Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?

Let me tell you something about Patty.

Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.

Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.

No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.

I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.

Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.

Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?

If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourselflong ago.

Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.

I might.

You ought to know why. Because

Smart, aren't you! So subtle.

He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.

Please don't shout.

You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'mI'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questionsI  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?

I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?

Well, if it's as serious as all thatwe'll move heaven and earth to

Ridiculous!

Well!

But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why

Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.

Why should she? After all

Why didn't you jam it down her throat?

What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?

We've done that already.

What happened?

Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 

Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?

The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!

It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.

Oh, yeah?

I beg your pardon!

No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it.

Why, noI  Yes . . . I guess I will.

I don't want it reported!

That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?

Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.

My ticket?

You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.

Take my advicegrab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.

Darn clever, these Armenians.

I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.

Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?

Your ego is colossal.

That, I suppose, makes everythinguhquite all right.

I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came firstthen the tiethen the shirtnow, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I

You've got a name, haven't you?

Like what?

Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.

It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. II did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?

Detectives!

Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.

Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?

We could start a two-person stock company. If things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]

After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.

Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.

Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.

Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.

Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?

I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.

This looks like the best spot.

What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?

Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.

Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're brokeand hungryand everything looks black. It's a long movement like this  with a follow through.

Here comes a car!

You! Don't make me laugh.

I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.

Eat a carrot.

What about money?

Better go back to your bed.

I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?

No, it isn't. I'm hungry andand scared.

Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.

How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?

But I don't go in for that kinda stuffmuch. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 

The old man's screwy!

Here's another wire from Peter Warne.

Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.

Okay, Joe. Listenyou know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turnanytime I ran into a story that looked goodI always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.

What's the thousand bucks for?

You're drunk.

Who's she gonna marry?

Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.

Yeah, where am I?

What?

Mush. Mush.

Mebbe.

Yeah.

What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.

Sh-sh-sh! Soft pedal, you mug!before I What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thingand you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.

Yeah ?How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.

Got a couple of kids, huh?

You'll keep your trap shut, all right.

Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.

If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.

William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this.  It went all over the country.  Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.

Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.

Street cats?

Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?

Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?

All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.

Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?

Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.

I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.

Bill.

You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.

Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?

What do you think, Lou?

I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.

Hold your horses.  What kinda source?

Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.

But why?

I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.

Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...

Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?

...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?

Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.

Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?

Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.

I believe the boys got a couple.

Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.

Why?  What's wrong?

I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?

Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.

What about Ruby?

Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?

Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?

I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.

No.

That's our case!

I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.

That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.

He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.

These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.

We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?

This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!

The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.

All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.

Aren't you being a little hard?

No.  Never heard of him.

Let me show you his picture. 

Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?

It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.

In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...

Honey, go back to sleep, please!

Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?

My sympathies.

Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.

Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.

Get a hold of yourself.

I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.

That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.

Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.

Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?

Post Office.

They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.

...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?

Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 

The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.

Who do you think changed the parade route?

General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.

Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.

I just plain don't trust him anymore.

Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.

Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?

Jim Garrison?

I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.

I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.

The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?

...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.

...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...

You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.

I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.

And he never hit you before?

How much more?

Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.

Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...

What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.

Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...

No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.

I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.

How many men are working with you on this?

That's all you've had all this time?

I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.

Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?

I need some information from you then.  How old are you?

Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?

Can I help you?

I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?

You were there for me.

Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?

Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.

I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.

She sound scared?

What's she want?

What's she willing to give us?

She knows it's my case?

We are. Don't worry about it.

I doubt it.  Who's your friend?

You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?

Help yourself.

Help us do what?

Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.

I can give you a lift home if you'd like?

Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?

Is it dark?

You're not tired of it?

What have they told you?

But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?

They wanted you to tell them what you know.

He's the one who wants you.

I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.

I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.

How do you get it out?

It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.

I walked right past you.

Does it happen to all men?

And Annette's it for you?

Who was your girl before Annette?

Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.

How old's Annette?

What're you, a bag lady?

Will Ordell go for that?

You're avoiding the question.

What do you do when he comes home?

You're rationalizing.

What if he checks it?

In a dress.

Tell him I want to give him his money.

I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.

I didn't use you, Max.

Madrid or Barcelona?

I thought you were tired of your business?

You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.

He say is a surprise.

Look, that shit ain't mine.

You know what we want.

This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.

I imagine shit needs to be done.

...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.

We could, if I'm not in jail.

Yes. All those things are true.

If it'll make you happy.

Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.

Oh, hi.

You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?

It looks good on you.

I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.

And what was your answer?

What do you think it is?

Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.

I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.

Yeah?

Yeah.

You told them that?

...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.

The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...

No, I give it to someone else first.

Can you cover that?

Drink?

I was there, I saw her do it.

I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.

Are you sure she don't know about the money?

How long?

You okay?

It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.

No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.

Which one?

That's a picture of me in Japan.

Yeah, that really hit the spot.

Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.

Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...

What are you doin'?

Lemme have the bag.

I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.

Yeah.

If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."

You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.

I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.

You shot Melanie?

So you're sure she's dead.

Where did you shoot her?

Where's the rest of it?

Maybe forty, maybe not that much.

Came outta where?

How long was she in there?

If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.

You know who I saw in the dress department?

I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.

I'm going out for a few hours.

They don't have your winning personality.

C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.

Who's it for? A relative?

Do you know what he's on probation for?

I can see that. Why?

The bond for possession is only a thousand.

What's up with this shit.

You still there?

That's all?

You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?

How the fuck did he find me?

Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?

My office.

She was afraid.

She's all alone.

Hope you don't mind keeping him company.

Get me out of here.

Take me home.

Dream on!

Hiya Jake. That was some dance.

Grass never did that to me.

Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.

Daddy!

You have an unusual hand.

Short? It's ended.

What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?

It's cold.

I am.

Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.

Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.

Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.

I saw Sarah the other day.

She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.

From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.

Well, I'll see what I can do about it.

Perfect. We got it.  Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.

What are you doing?

Are you in the service?

Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that.

I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,  this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.

Christ, I know how it sounds.

I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.

Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?

If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?

She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.

I don't have to ask if you can feel that.

Where are you?

I moved the couch. That's all.

Who? Jed?

And where do you think Jezebel comes from?

I must have been out of my head.

Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.

What?

Wait. Don't.

I'm going home.

Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.

'Cause she's always on your mind.

Oh, come on. It's early.

Can't you stop it?

He's coming right over.

I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.

It's just me.

Are you out of your mind?

Bullshit!

Please.

What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?

TELL ME, DAMN YOU!

Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?

Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?

No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.

Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.

But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?

I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.

The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.

You come here often?

Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.

I think I'm falling asleep.

I can't move.

And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.

Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.

How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.

Where's Wong?

He's burning up.

Please come quietly.

Push 'em back.

I'm sorry.

Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?

Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.

You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?

It's not worth it. You'll never win.

Still married, Jake?

I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.

Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.

What is it Paul? What's happening to me?

The army?

Last month, before Thanksgiving.

On top of him?

I don't have all day, kid.

Rizzo pull the fucking lever!

His mother?

Can't shut em' down from here.

Okay that hurt.

Everyone okay?

Hey! I'm not ready.

Kay-Em!

We'd need charges.

It bought us some time.

Earth II.

Boeman, the ships not here.

Get them in the lab!

You're a teacher.

I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.

Jesus, God!

Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?

Don't just stand there! Shoot him!

Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!

Rizzo?!

My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.

You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.

Got it.  You ever space walked?

Go-go-go-go-go!!!!

Okay?!!

I'll help you in.

He's trying to ask you out on a date.

I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.

Jesus!

I don't know...sorry?

Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.

It's just you and me, then.

Kay-em you okay?

I don't understand...what does he want?

Hypothetically, how much are we talking?

How did I get here, how did you bring me back?

Jason! Can't you see? He did this.

Azrael can you repeat that?

You're not going anywhere.

Guys, please come with me!

He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!

Just a favor for your old man.

And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.

And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.

You got it?

The wire's showing!

How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?

Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.

That's it! Radio in for help!

What about us?

You want to go through those?  I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.

Sexy, hm? What was I before?

Can you stand something to eat?

It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.

You too, sweetheart...

I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.

Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!

Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.

You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.

I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.

Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?

There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...

What's that?

...Nothing.

Wait a minute! I need you.

What's that, a ship?

What the hell?

Think the tide's with us?

You from around here?

You wanna call it a night after here?

You love sharks?

Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.

Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.

Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?

Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?

Over there!

Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.

Easy! It'll tear right out!

He's heading under -- !

Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?

Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.

You know how I feel about her.

When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.

Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.

Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.

So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.

Really? What are they like?

Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.

We could get back together too.

Well, we were once. You know, that time.

Leah just told me you were going with her.

You're being really immature.

I still have your virginity!

What? Are you ashamed that we did it?

I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.

Hey man.

That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.

Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.

We don't even have a dog!

Wow, dream big!

You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?

Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.

Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.

Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?

Viscera?

What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?

Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.

No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?

You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?

Junk?

This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.

Uh, thanks.

Cute?

I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.

Oh, okay. Like this.

I'm leaving Vanessa.

No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!

A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.

You should try Adderall.

Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?

I think pregnancy is beautiful.

Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.

Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?

Then what's going on?

No...

Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?

You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...

Did you say you were thinking about adoption?

Excuse me?

Hi Dad.

I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.

Yeah, like people in love.

I sort of already have.

Or...

Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!

Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?

Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.

So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?

When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?

You're not listening to me.

Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.

Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!

No way! She's pretty.

I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.

I wish my funbags would get bigger.

I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.

Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.

I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.

Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?

I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.

We're actually, finally doing this?

...Pardon?

One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...

Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.

Better not, or Early'd whip me.

...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?

I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.

What's this?

The police are after him, he's a murderer!

Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...

Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?

What's wrong with her?

Never heard of it, any huntin'?

You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?

That bad?

Now why is that?

...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.

Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?

Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.

Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.

Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.

What did he sound like on the phone?

Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.

You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?

What's that?

There's more...

What about you?

Bri'.

Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?

Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.

Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...

You were plenty hot.

Could be.

How old you?

Yes. Altogether.

Were they wearing condoms?

Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.

Oh shit. How long did it take?

Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.

I can tell that she had just entered puberty.

Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.

Well, those guys share everything, right?

Can you do it man?

I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.

It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?

I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.

I don't understand why you do that.

So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.

Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.

About ten. Fifteen is good.

You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?

Yo, you got any weed around here?

Where you goin' tonight?

Yo, you think we killed that guy?

I was lookin' for you all day today.

No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.

I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.

Who are they?

What is it?

This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.

Because your a virgin?

Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.

Come dance.

Have you ever had anal intercourse?

I'm sorry.

Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.

Yeah well, it's been a bad day.

Did you and your boyfriend just break up?

Are you in trouble with the law?

Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.

I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.

Hello.

You are being ripped open.

You didn't?

Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...

I'm coming.

Just a lot of crazy shit.

Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.

Yep.

Yeah.

You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.

No. I was just kidding.

Hello?

Hello?

That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.

Yeah.

It was... it was.

I can't man.

It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?

What do you mean, no?

Morpheus.

We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.

You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?

We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.

You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?

Yes you are.

You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!

The message!  I figured out--

You think he's dirty?

I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.

Why does he call Sanderson?

It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.

Hello, Peter.

Why did you write remember on the wall?

Why not?

Hello?

And you want these girls to feel your pain?

I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.

What makes you think I was there?

Hello.

Yes?

I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!

Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.

D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.

There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...

What scars?

They asked who would be best suited for this and you--

Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.

Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?

Do you like my dad?

What are you doing up?

Don't you have something you want to say to David?

What about prints?

You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?

I'm busy right now.

I see you're still having problems with your openings.

You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.

It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.

He's right, Kathy.

If you can think of anything else give us a call.

I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?

He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!

A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?

Answer the question.

Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.

Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.

You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.

It's a good play, but risky.

We got a problem?

About what?

She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?

Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.

Sorry.  I thought it was empty.

I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.

Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?

Are you one of the players?

I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?

What are you looking for?

It wasn't intentional.

What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?

Relax.

I know it was bad.

Doesn't that scare you?

Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?

Alright.  What about me?

Nothing.

In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?

Peter...

Why?

You're right.  The killer told me.

You're going to be late for your match.

It's over now.

Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.

Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.

I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.

Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?

Colwyn ...

In the Arctic ice.

You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.

We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.

Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?

There is nothing.

Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.

You choose these?

She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.

She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.

The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?

No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.

Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!

I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!

He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful.

They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...

She must make a glaive.

She can see the Beast!

I road them often in my youth.

Even by you?

I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.

It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?

Once is enough, thank you.

Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...

Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.

We could reach it on fire-mares.

Can't I come, too?

My heart stays here.

Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...

What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?

Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.

I am being exploited! Where are you going?

Oh, my poor stew!

Passable, pimple, very passable.

He was aiming a huge spear right at me!

He is the King.

I do not want your power. It is hideous.

I do not want your worlds or your slaves.

Freylag's stronghold?

It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.

Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.

For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.

Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.

Knowledge I wouldn't want.

We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.

I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.

Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.

We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.

I'll stay behind and keep them busy.

Kegan!

I was beautiful then.

She bore you many children?

Do not try your trickery on me!

You see?

Knowledge.

...Office 2702.

Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?

...Good...  But what's special in him?

...You moved too, didn't you?

Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.

Why can't I have a bank account?

Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?

What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.

I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?

You see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but I prefer this!

...I'm going to kiss you.

...You don't believe me, don't you?

Where are you going?

...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?

Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?

It's too big.

Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.

I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.

Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?

Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!

No! I don't want to leave you!!

How are you, Miss?

Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.

...OK... Good.

Salute.

You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.

What is it?

Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --

How long does this... Mania last?

This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.

What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?

I know what you're getting at.

I've seen it before.

You thought I sent them?

Ellen?

It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.

What it is -- is the truth.

Anything?

A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.

There's no reason.

I do love you... very, very much.

... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.

I don't know.

If I die, you'll know where to look for me?

Why?

Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.

Shit!  He jumped!

Well, hello.

You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.

There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.

Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett...  Pride and Prejudice.

Are you firing me?

Phileas Fogg?

Tom Joad?

Are they standing?

Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.

There are a lot of people worried about you.

What do your friends call you?

You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.

I don't have kids.

Where did he go?

Hello, Mr. Parker.

Orange soda?

Coffee?

Water?

One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.

Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.

Do you want to fuck now?

What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?

I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.

First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?

Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.

Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.

Sera you are crazy.

Hi!

Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?

I like it here with you.

Hey, Brad... how's it going?

Where have you been?

A full night on the street and this is all?

Harvard Law School?

What alibi?

Why would I kill my husband?

Were you with another man?

Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.

It's so shameful...

I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.

Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?

Good work today, Ms. Woods.

I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?

So she was distraught that her husband was dead?

Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?

I'm sorry?

You can't even imagine.

I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.

What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.

So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?

You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.

I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.

Our group is full.

You're pawning The Rock?!

Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.

Too demure?

We still love you. Sisters forever!

Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!

Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?

You have Stromwell.

And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.

You're kind of being a butt-head right now.

I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.

Damn. We can't see her for an hour?

How can you still believe she's innocent?

And you know this for a fact?

As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.

Someone missed you.

No -- it's just -- not me.

Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?

I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!

What?

What're you doing here?!

I did?

I don't know --

It's pink.

His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.

You don't really believe she's innocent?

You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.

I'm fully amenable to that discussion.

I completely agree.

C'mon. Let me take you home.

You go where?

That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.

Pink ones.

Thanks for the backup.

Why so few?

You go?  Not watch fun?

You go to lady now?

You... you're a beast!

Do you feed on mice and rats?

Damn you!

Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...

When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.

You're a beast!

It sounded like it came from the courtyard.

Might we watch, too?

Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...

No, wait... please... listen...

Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.

No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic.

Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.

Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.

Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?

Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?

Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.

Are we here?

What do I do?

Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.

The princess is dead.

If the horn be restored the curse is ended.

Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.

I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.

I'm sure.  It spoke to me.

How do we follow a raven we can't even see?

There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.

My God!  Look!

Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.

God's blessing.

What make ye of that, Jack?

Is she... dead?

Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.

Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.

Hold, Jack!  Don't strike!

Give in to despair and all is lost.

Aye.  We're good as inside.

Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.

I'm not afraid of the dark.

The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.

Can't we move any faster?

Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?

A good day for singing...

Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.

You see!  You see!

Aye... my Lord...

How're these?

These for me?

I detest serpents.

What shall we do?

I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.

How much longer?

Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.

Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.

Where are you going?

Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!

Not even the birds sing sweet as you.

I have no wife.

Lili!  No!

What?

Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.

I can't see a thing.

Honored to make your acquaintance.

Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.

Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.

Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.

How do I get the horn back?

Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.

No!

And charmed, of course.

How so?

Where?

Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.

There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.

You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.

What's that for?

Red.

Oh...I set it to see if it would work.

Don't you have school?

Can you keep Sam straight?

You're a good girl.

You have to ask like that?

Did you feel anything?

Hey.

I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.

I can't even take a shower here.

Really?

This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.

I'm coming in.

We're not gonna do anything.

I was wondering.

I thought I was helping you.

Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?

You'd hate him for the trick.

Where are you?!

Why is that?

Well, he doesn't need to worry.

And of course the Beck's, with the...

I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?

That would take weeks.

I'm good, thanks.

Pardon me?

Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.

All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.

I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.

Well, it's the least I can do.

If she's not up, you can use my shower.

Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?

I did warn you.

I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.

I'll be around to check up on you.

Because I live there.

Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.

Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?

I hate turkey.

I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.

I'm not doing it!

I don't beg.

I'm leaving.

Well, until you know, you can't go.

You can't make me do a thing.

What are you now?

I know parts of who you are.

I'm proud of you, Sam.

After everything.

And you told Mom today?

We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement.

Can you build a house in four months?

Good for you.

I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.

Ah!  Oh....

Because Dad left?

Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?

Lock the door behind you.

Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.

The garage.

When's school over?

Thank you for at least sounding sincere.

I used to live here.

I've been wrong a lot in my life.

Where's Sam?

It's been a while.

Let's see if you've gotten any better.

Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.

Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.

Nothing is going on with us, is it?

You've never said that before.

Let's not do this, okay?

Peter left me yesterday.

I better get the kids home.

Been thinking?

He said he heard hammering.

Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?

I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.

I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.

That's the problem.

Where are the kids?

I hardly recognize you with a beard.

All day again?

A night in the hole?

She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.

He's a big one.

It's 1945. It's a different world now.

Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.

Yeah...

Yeah.

Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.

I've never seen you in here before.

Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.

Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.

Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.

Where they taking us, anyway?

What are they gonna do to us?

No, tell me what's so funny.

At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.

Maybe we oughta find another place.

Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?

She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...

What ain't there?

Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.

This fork is filthy.

I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...

That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.

Does that mean I'm in?

I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?

You drew this?!

Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.

Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.

You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.

Crop duster.

My daddy died in prison. He gave up hope and hung himself. What you're talking about is the same damn thing. That ain't how I'm going.

Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.

I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.

Back to New York for starters.

Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.

Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?

Just put some mustard on it and eat it.

If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead.

Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?

Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.

That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?

That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.

1932? That's like, that's like...

Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.

I can't take that, mama.

I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.

Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.

That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.

What are you in for, Willie?

What's the Boom Boom Room?

Where'd you get this?

He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.

Little Nicky.

I knew it. He's finally retiring.

You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.

Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.

The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...

Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?

Wow. What... what did she look like?

Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."

Valerie's crying!

What's Nicky doing down there?

Did you just talk?

Makin' friends already.

Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!

From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.

This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!

Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.

All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.

Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.

You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.

I didn't murder anybody

Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?

Knock, knock.

I mean... tough break.

I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?

You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.

Bus?

I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!

What's with that guy?

This don't look good.

What's Ozzy trying to say there?

Hello.

You think I'm a tourist?

The South.

Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!

This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?

You have a dog? What kind?

Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.

Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.

What were you thinking coming here?

I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.

Don't do it.

Yes. What is rent?

Hey...

For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!

No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!

Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken?  I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either.  No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?

There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --

How do you want us?

How did they get in here?

Do you have anything special in mind?

Had enough?

You missed something special.

Who invited you?

I just might look in on New You 483 myself.

Of course.

Why aren't you in Nursery?

And?

Are you a 5 or a 6? 

Maybe... sure...

Why show me?

I don't..

I'd rather be with you.

Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.

Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.

When did you begin to question Lastday?

The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast

I -- I can't.

Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.

Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...

Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.

It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.

Don't ever let go.

It all seemed to make sense until Box.

...But I still have the choice...?

That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?

Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.

Goodbye.

How long have you been living here?

But there may be a few around somewhere.

My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?

Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?

My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.

Can you make it back?

Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.

Listen.

You want somethin'?

Pete... You okay?

How'd the camera get so high like that?

What a fuckin' job.

We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.

What's that, Ed?

I want more.

Hi.

Dick Laurent?

Hey.

Please tell me.

His condition? What do you mean?

Have you made any charges against him?

Then he's coming home with his mother and me.

Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?

You just gonna let him go?

That's not Fred Madison?

Yeah, Mack?

When he went to work, right.

Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?

Do you remember?

He's not Madison?

WHAT DID YOU SAY?

I won't ever tailgate.

Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?

Something wrong?

What is it?

You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?

Good book, huh?

You're up early.

I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.

I told you to stay in the car!

They're gonna cook him.

Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.

The heart, I guess.

I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.

I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.

At sixty?

Yeah. Give ya a boner.

If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.

Hello.

Okay.

What's happening to you? What happened to your face?

What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.

Last time I saw you.

Whatiya mean, Sheila?

Why don't you like me?

Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?

All of it?

Where's the girl? Miss Stone.

Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!

Two years!?

Fossils, huh?

Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?

Yeah, I remember. You said that before.

Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.

Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?

Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!

Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.

You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.

I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.

Well, that's that, I guess.

It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?

That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.

Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!

Chalmers Bryant!

Cave, eh? Where?

I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?

It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.

We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.

Who?

Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.

Yes. I'm afraid it does.

Charming, isn't she?

Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.

Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.

Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.

Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.

Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.

Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.

The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.

He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!

You're lying, aren't you?

You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago  you're still alive, Father Perrault!

Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.

You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.

Oh George, come on.

What is it? Has he fainted?

Yes.

Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.

Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.

Did I say "if"?

Porters?

George, what do you think you're doing?

What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.

Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.

George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?

Maria?

What's she got to do with it?

She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.

What about the others?

Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.

was saying

Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.

Where did you come from?

Where were you hiding?

I guess we're in for it.

Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.

You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?

Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?

Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.

Ouch!

You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?

I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?

That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.

EXCUSE ME

You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.

I'll make some for you!  You will come today?

Thank you.

The hell happened?

The hell were you thinking?

Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...

of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--

Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...

Only the damn guy won't know it.

So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.

Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.

Which do you have your money on, Dee?

Kay, listen, I dunno what got into--

Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.

It's a bug.

I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.

What?

A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.

What's going on, Kay?

Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?

Since how long?

Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.

Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.

Right, right-- I like that stuff.

I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...

What are you doing?

And I'm arranging deportation papers.

Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?

Goodwill...

I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.

Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--

We need to talk to you about the alien.

Which way?

I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.

He's gone, too.

And they're buying it?

And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?

Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?

Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.

What?

Agatha --

Drop some money.

I have to go back.

She's not alive, but she didn't die.

I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.

About who?

I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...

Why?

You don't remember me, do you?

From where?  D.C.?

It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.

You the only sentry?

Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"

Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.

Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?

You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.

Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --

If he's looking for a flaw in the system --

I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.

What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?

John --

Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.

Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.

We can't grab it...

Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.

Red Ball?

Why did you catch that?

You're certain?

It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.

To them.

I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.

You set me up...

She spoke to me.

Wally, listen to me...

Just go to the beginning!

Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?

I scored a goal!

What the hell.

Oh, Sean --

I forgive you...

... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.

It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --

But you have to.  They said you would.

Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.

Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.

You don't seem all that proud.

Heal who?

It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.

What safe place is that?

John?

It's insanity around here.

The guy from USA Today is here.

Congratulations, sir.

He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?

Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?

Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.

He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?

According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.

I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?

By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.

Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?

So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.

Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.

The man across the street.  I've seen him before...

Since right after we lost our son.

You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.

What was it then?

Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.

Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.

Honestly, the suites are all about the same.

I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.

So, wait, you're from where?

You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?

I don't get it. What do you do?

Ricky's not wearing one.

It's daytime.

She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.

Well, that's not gonna happen.

No coke tonight.  Right?

Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.

Take her.

What's your record at?

C'mon girl. Eat up.

What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?

So, when's the drop.

Brooklyn.

He must have that shit troughed.

How so?

That it?

Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?

They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.

You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.

That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.

Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?

Yes.

I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.

Nah.

Where is the Soho Grand?

I can wait around if you want.

Spa?

'Trustafarians?'

I'm on the phone.

Sorry, man, but...

Did Max mention anything about any jobs?

What about it?

You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.

So, it's not a winning record.

How am I being shitty?

I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.

Ask if he said anything to her.

Come on, man. Not with the owners here.

We need guns.

Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.

Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.

I like it.

How'd you unlock my phone?

No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --

Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.

See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.

Who you calling?

How much is it?

Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.

It's on West Broadway. We can walk.

This is bullshit, man.

You sold it? I thought they stole it.

What the fuck is that supposed --

You know this guy?

Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?

So is this the drop?

You happy?

Where do you think you're going?

You fucking nuts?

You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.

He wants to see us now.

What are you doing.

I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.

Let's check out the penguins.

We need guns.

You did?

This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.

It's gonna be fine.

Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.

Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.

C'mon...

Where's the surprise?

You want to come splash around.

What's up, man.

You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?

You look good, man.

How much is what?

How do you know it's not drugs?

I'm not saying shit to neither of you.

What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'

See you later.

Ow, shit...

Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.

Here they are, then.

Brilliantly. Care for a pint?

Sorry about that. Where's your mate?

I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...

Is it nice?

Yeah.

I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?

A lot of Persians?

Yeah.

What about my keys?

I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.

Keeps me out of the army.

Daddy, where's my money?

Shit, what else she gonna say?

You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.

Who the hell are you?

If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?

Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?

What did you give it to me for then?

Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.

The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.

Don't con me. Don't try...

Don't con me.

What for?

That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?

Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.

I will do it.

I want to, Bembry, but I can't.

Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?

Is the program ready?

I see your point.

Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.

Let's talk about you for a change.

Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.

You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.

I'm in Detroit.

I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.

I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.

I just want to sit here and be still.

Talk about what?

"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."

"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."

To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?

A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.

Get some sleep.

I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.

I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?

I assumed...

Let's cancel.

They were Hebrew, weren't they?

What color were the original Hebrews?

If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.

Can I ask you something?

'Bout every other night, Red.

She know?

Is she hooking?

I better not come in.

Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.

To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.

I'm with you, Brother Minister.

You're my father.

That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.

Sweetie, they're almost ready.

Hey, man, gimme some skin.

Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.

Bang, bang. You're dead.

Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?

Only a pig could do a thing like that.

We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.

You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.

Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.

You have no interest in making things easy, do you?

[Senor?]

What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?

[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]

[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]

[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]

[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]

Who's he?

[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]

[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]

[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]

[Maybe your men stole from you.]

[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]

Is it loaded?

And what if amateurs try it?

When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?

I'm here.

You got a secondary search and you had a gun.

But don't you stay in El Paso?

You been working?

You mean a misfire?

You got three of the fuckers. All dead.

Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.

I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.

Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?

Pinta, do you have a pencil?

You're fast.

Do you think he'll come back?

They'll be back in a week.

The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?

Well, it's a sort of wife.

Remember you asked me what state I was from?

The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.

Then be trained.

It makes it all seem so serious.

Jordan!

They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.

I don't believe you.

Creasy... Wait.

Rosanna Guerrero.

Where are you?

[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]

[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]

Bye, Mom.

A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.

I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.

My wife, Mr. Creasy.

She likes him.

It will be a hard break.

[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]

[Then what do you have to lose?]

[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]

Tell me about your friend Creasy.

You helped him get this job.

None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.

Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.

I told you she wasn't attractive...

So waddaya feel like doing tonight?

Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?

Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?

Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.

I could see she likes you.

So what do you feel like doing tonight?

Yeah, she looks all right from here.

Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.

Waddaya gonna do now?

Marty, your mother wants you onna phone.

Hey! What are you doing here?

I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.

I don't think I remember him.

That's my son Thomas's baby.

So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.

It pains that they should do this.

So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.

So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.

Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.

Wadda you think?

You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.

Marty...

No...

You got an elevator in this house?

Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then.

No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.

Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.

What?

I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.

Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? What's he want? Five thousand down? You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice.

Hello, Ma.

Oh, we got plenny-a room here.

It's loaded with what?

Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.

Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.

I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!

All right, Ma. I'll be back in about an hour, an hour anna half.

Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.

She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?

All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.

Well...

On accounta...

Tommy...

Wadda you so sore about?

Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!

Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.

Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.

Where?

Miss you, Walt.

This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.

So long, Ho-Jon.

What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?

Christ Almighty, I think he means it!

This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.

Never mind. Forget it.

How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?

But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.

We think the same way.

Wait a second...

Is that liquor?

Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.

I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.

Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?

Radar!

Black capsule.

Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.

We stand behind all our work.

Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.

Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?

It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.

We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.

Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?

I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'

I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.

Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?

What's the matter?

Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.

Very happily married.

Even if I weren't.

How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?

Two-man job. How much blood has he had?

You really say the cutest things.

He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.

Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.

If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?

There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.

But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.

Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?

Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.

But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.

In the direction you want to go.

How much time do I have?

Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.

There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.

We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.

What's going on? Who started this?

We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...

Sir?

To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.

Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.

Yeah?

Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.

Hello, John.

Uh-huh . . .

Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.

Go ahead, driver! Ball park!

. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?

Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?

Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, er  This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell.

Thank you very much for everything.

Better let me talk to him.

Oh!

That's good.

And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?

Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!

Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!

That's your father's diary, Ann.

Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.

That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!

The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.

We'll get a handwriting expert to  What!

Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doeand he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!

Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.

Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?

What John Doe?

That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!

Okay, sister, you get your job back.

Hurry up, Pop.

All right, boys, here he is.

But, he's gonna jump off a building!

Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.

Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.

And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.

Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterdayhere he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!

What's the idea?

How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?

Colonel!

No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!

Had any schooling?

What do you do when you work?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.

Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!

Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.

Now, that's all right, isn't it?

Sure.

Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babiesbut stay out o' newspaper business!

If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.

Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut andI'll eat him.

Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!

It's good to see you. Sit down.

Flowers.

Pretty good?  Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!

Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.

Say, who's putting up this dough?

Have you got the speech I gave you?

A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 

I don't know.

This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.

You told Antonucci that shit came from me.

You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.

Tell me what's wrong.

How can I help you with the particles?

They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.

I hate fucking Springfield.

It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.

Manual or automatic?

Hi, Roper.

The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...

Are you in charge, Roper?

Open your shirt.

Satisfied?

I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?

Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?

We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?

You got a girlfriend?

Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.

Where did you hear that?

Get good at it.

What's the first commandment?

Yes.

To save lives.

You know why I like the track?

I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.

The 6 horse is last.

We won!

You're crazy.

How many have you lost?

I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.

Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?

Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.

Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.

You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.

Hey.

Yeah. I'm sorry.

I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.

You think I didn't need you?

I've been craving that stuff all week.

Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.

I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.

Hmm?

Yeah.

That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...

I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.

It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...

Stay up there, Girl...

Where's the damn wire?!

There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.

What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?

Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.

Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.

The car is part of the deal.

I can't do that.

You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.

Are these yours?

God-Damn you!

System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.

You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --

It's okay.

How come I can't remember?

Why --

It's all here...

Divinity?

The woman you're stuck on.

Take care.

He had keys.

Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.

The only way to eject it is from the inside.

A hotel?

Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.

Not his style.

Then you had her killed.

An interface attendant.

Someone you have to get back to?

But I don't know anything about programming.

Why?

What?

I'm sorry.

What's so funny?

Why not?

Voice activate.

Access granted.  Male or female?

It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.

Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late.

So how can we get to it?

I can hardly walk...

SABER TOOTH TIGER!

Let's teach these vermin a few manners.

Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!

... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers...

Ay, yi, yi!  The Rangers are going to be CRUSHED!

PTERODACTYL!

Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.

Two thirty three a.m.

THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!

Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.

Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.

There goes the neighborhood.

Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.

No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.

Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!

Anybody see them?

How the heck?!...

We're asking you to go to prison.

If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.

Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.

One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!

You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.

The goddamned bastards.

Boo-Boo.

Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.

Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.

Bastard didn't even show.

No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?

I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.

Inside, they were talking of you.

Same here.

Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?

Charlie!

Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.

Who'll make the rules?

You fellas got names?

Meyer just finished the books.

Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.

At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.

How soon can we pull this off?

Tommy Reina's gone over to Maranzano, but so far Masseria ain't lifted a finger,

We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.

Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?

It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.

What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.

We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.

Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.

Where we headed?

You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.

You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!

When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.

I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.

The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.

If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.

Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.

Salvatore. Always holding himself above.

The terms will be mine.

I will be the Boss of All Bosses.

Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.

Thank you for keeping me informed.

Forget it.

So we're gonna knock 'em both off?

What a cozy little scene.

You're fuckin' crazy.

Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.

The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.

Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.

<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.

Death! Thank you!

Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.

You're really gonna pop the question?

Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...

Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.

Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.

You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?

It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...

I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?

How was it? I don't recall.

Hypnos?

Go. Just <u>go</u>.

Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!

You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.

I'm reportin' this to my union!!

Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resumé. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?

Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.

My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?

Is there something else I can do for you?

So, what do you think?

... What are they all doing there?

I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.

You know ...  ... whoops!

Mom, I need to talk to you.

You know that guy in the pictures you saw?

Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!

And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.

I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.

You mean it's dangerous?

Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.

The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.

Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?

You've never *seen* this contract.

Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.

And while you're at it, get me a bed!

Getting on to dinner, isn't it, pal?

What's this, Diz?

Huh?

Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!

Yeah.

How about getting married?

My first name's--Clarissa.

Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.

Taylor, my dear.

No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--

Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--

Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?

Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.

Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!

What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.

What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?

Jeff for Senator.

Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.

When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--

Washington!

My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.

Here they are--I got them. They are all right.

You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that off--if you want to *hear* something! Good evening, Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann.

Mr. President!

Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.

Yes, I was--

Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--

Well--goodnight.

But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--

Mr. President--

Oh, now--

Can't you?

What's your name?

Is--is something the matter?

Gee, I'm sorry. You see, it wasn't until I was fairly well along in the bus that I realized--

I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--

Whose statue is that?

My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?

A *day*!

Good. Where are we?

Pardon?

--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?

Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.

Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--

You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.

What do they--? Who are all those--?

Gee--I hope so. What's all this?

No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 

It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.

I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!

Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--

Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!

Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?

Ah! That's more like it! What?

Sure.

I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?

Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.

The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?

Order, gentlemen!

Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.

Since the time of Adams--not Washington.

Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--

What! Who?

Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--

--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--

Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--

Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--

Well--me, too!

That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--

Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.

Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.

Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?

I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !

We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.

All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.

I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.

Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?

That's all, Miss Bennett.

Tell me more about yourself.

You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?

Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.

Sure. I met you.

Have you seen the papers?

Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.

I say, to most people it's a washout.

I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.

Yeah, I know.

The drums. He taught me to play some.

Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?

You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.

Mary, I'm going home.

Well, here we are again.

You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?

Search me. Ask the Gypsies.

The guy's balmy.

Just a minute. No, you don't.

Oh, he's not getting away with anything.

Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?

What're you going to do?

This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.

I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.

Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?

Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.

How's it going? Okay?

Is that the best you've got?

Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?

I wish you luck, sir.

He's not home, I tell you!

Thank heaven.

Must we have the echo?

Newspaperman?

Where?

Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie

Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.

Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?

You're going to New York with us.

I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.

No?

I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.

I mean, about the Power of Attorney.

Why not? Who is he?

I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.

I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.

If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to

We provide opera.

That's impossible. The opera has never paid.

The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!

Let him alone.

Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!

Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.

Yes, sir.

You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.

Please, Mr. Cedar!  Proceed.

Uh-huh.

Who are they?

No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married

Farmer?

Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.

What do you think you're doing?

Yes, sir.

She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.

Please!

Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.

Why, that's an echo, sir!

Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3

I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.

-- The argument had nothing to do with it.

It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.

You can go out there if you like...

Dr. Mumford.

Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...

I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?

You're the shrink, aren't you?

But you do therapy?

But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.

Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.

I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.

We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?

I see.

-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --

Why? I'm paying for this.

I was... never satisfied.

You remember when I asked you about pornography --

You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.

Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.

Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.

You're the doctor, what do you think?

What?

So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?

That's a lot of people all at once.

What do you want to know?

They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.

...so rich?

Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.

Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.

...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --

-- you crazy? You can't do this!

It's a country club. Don't worry about it.

What's wrong with her?

What's happening here?

Well, look who's here...

Just who is here, can you tell me?

No.

Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?

I'm not making any promises.

She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.

Is that the technical description of what I've got?

Sore throat?

Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.

You're doing great.

...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.

Is that when you split up?

And he's where?

I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?

When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.

I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.

I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?

Is it something you've heard about me?

All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?

Oh.

...but first, you have to tell me something...

We're only talking about six weeks.

Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?

Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.

I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.

What did he want you to do?

...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.

Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.

Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?

Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.

Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.

Hey, Skip.

A doll?

Sounds like you have several.

An IRS investigator with a drug problem?

And a birth certificate is enough?

Who the hell are these guys?

Oh yes, of course.

If he arrives before us, it will be too late.

How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?

Altar boys?

O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!

Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.

C'mon, friend.

Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?

He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.

Immune from what?

Yeah?

She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.

I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.

Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.

The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?

No women allowed.

Fifty percent.

A bright good morning to all.

We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.

You were actually at Hamunaptra?

-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.

Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.

Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.

No... Why?... Should I?

Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.

No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.

I'm staying.

You called me your girl?

Got guts, lady.

You...! YOU...!

Have you no respect for the dead?

Jonathan?

Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?

Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.

I'm your sister.

It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this

What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?

Hey,... don't I know you?

Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.

That thing gives me the creeps.

Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?

Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.

Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.

Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!

I knew you'd know.

What are you doing all alone in the dark?

Our guests are waiting.

You two timing psychotic bastard.

Do I?

Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.

Much less go outside.

How about... the Savage Six?

But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.

But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --

Hey... you okay?

I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.

You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.

Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!

Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...

I admire you.

Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.

I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.

Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --

So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?

Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --

Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.

Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.

And it would be the right thing to do.

We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!

Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 

Nah.

Firepower costs money.

What are you doing in the silver drawer?

You did?

Or Batman --

Do we have to?

And a social life.

But, Doc... where's the machine guns?

We're outnumbered twenty to one.

If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.

Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.

Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.

What do you think Napoleon will do?

Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.

What do you mean?

Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down.

I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.

The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.

And who is defending Paris?

Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.

I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.

Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.

Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.

Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.

Was the trip normal in every respect?

I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.

Bastia -- and you?

Just a minute, General.  Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da.  They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.

When you eat him, may I have some?

When did it start?

Impossible, I don't believe it.

But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.

That is correct.

A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.

And he sent you to me?

Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.

I'm afraid I am, just a bit.

Thank you, Napoleon.

I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.

No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.

Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.

Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.

Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?

Were any of them married?

Promise me you will never leave me.

Promise me.

I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.

Promise.

Yes -- what is it?

Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.

How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.

But you will not... be safe...

Who is it?

I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.

No, one cannot simply ignore it.

Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.

Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?

Nothing.  That's all I can say.

That's all I can say.

What?

I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.

Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.

Those are extremely harsh terms.

Is he alone?

Come in.

Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.

Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.

Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.

Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.

Stretch it out.

Who are you?

We didn't come here for Day-Day.

No I'm not.

Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.

It's about to work, just come on.

Nobody!

You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion.

Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.

I walked.

$247.

What's the matter?

Yeah, air.

You go first.

Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.

You're welcome, Unc.

You sure you don't wanna stay?

Karla.

To the Cucamonga shopping center.

You want us to give you a ride?

Hello, remember me?

I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.

Most definitely.

I did.  Is that door locked?

Next time, page me first.

What is it?

What it smell like?

You coming in?

My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?

Yeah, I'm 'bout it.

Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.

That the big one, huh?

Today ain't my day.

I do.

Roach...Roach, come on.

'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.

Hey.

What?!  What that mean?

Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.

Get 'em, Craig!

What the fuck you looking at?

Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.

We must be here 'cause we stopped.

You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?

My back.

Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.

Come on, baby, let's go in the house.

Don't remind me.

Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.

All right, I'll do it.

Business or pleasure?

Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.

'S okay. What do you think?

Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...

If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.

I have a problem.

Good luck.

Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.

Yes, yes, I understand.

This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?

You get another chance in ten minutes.

How should I...?

I kill her - and you kill me.

Come back.

One thirty. California Ballroom.

I talk to her or you can forget about it.

All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.

Are you sure?

But...

I think you better put that away.

We have to hurry.

He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".

You remember me?

There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.

Irene is going to help.

What am I supposed to say to her?

I don't have to pay you nothin'.

Oh, we'll have to do better than that.

Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?

This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!

He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.

Where are we going?

I've got something for you.

Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?

Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.

He never told about the money.

You killed two men, Ben Harper.

If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.

..."and I won't never tell about the money."

Leavin', boy?

Where's Ruby?

AAA-MENN!

There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?

What can we do, Mother?

Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell

Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.

You go set down by the River.

It's all here.

Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.

If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.

I'm hungry, John.

John?

Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!

Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!

Are we goin' home, John?

I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!

Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.

I'll see to Pearl.

Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?

What are you doing, boy?

What's that you're playing with, boy?

She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?

All right...  Come along.

John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.

Yes; John's bad.

You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?

What do you figure to do?

She'll come draggin' her tail back home.

You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?

She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.

Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!

I been bad!

This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.

What'd you all talk about?

What happened? That needle sank like a rock.

Oh my god, oh my god...

You okay?

Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.

Guess I did.

M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?

You believe in the Boogey Man?

You believe in anything?

Yeah. So?

Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.

Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!

Bring him out of what?

How you plan to do that?

You crazy? Hit him with what?

Rod's not a lunatic.

She dreamed this would happen...

You used me, daddy!

Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.

Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.

-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?

She lived there.

Who? Who did that?

Did you sleep?

Get into bed.

Take this, it'll help you sleep.

Go even crazier?

It's real, Mamma. Feel it.

Guess I should'n'a done it.

No more fights?

An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?

I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.

And you too, Ninotchka.

No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.

Well, a hat...

A dress you wear in the evening.

When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.

You feel it, though.

What is it, Anna?

You wouldn't like Razinin.

A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.

Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...

And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!

Yes! We could stay with Leon!

Let's be happy that we're all alive.

What a lovely room you have here.

Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?

This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.

Which lawyer?

Comrade Buljanoff...

The former Duchess!

Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?

About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.

Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.

A blue shirt, perhaps?

I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?

You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?

Good evening, Your Highness.

Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.

Is this satisfactory?

We can wait.

Yes, Leon...

Let's do that.

...des petites fraises des bois... de la crème de Bretagne... 

Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...

Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?

I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?

What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?

And if we have to go to Siberia...

I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.

A week?

...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."

I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?

We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!

I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.

Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.

Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.

Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?

I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.

Yes. Could you give me some information?

The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...

You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.

Then you don't want me to go there.

What do we do now?

I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.

I will start with you.

And what is your profession?

You are something we do not have in Russia.

You repeat yourself.

It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.

I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?

It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?

Was that talkative?

Glorious, analytical...

I must go.

I was sent here by my country to fight you.

It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...

Room service speaking.

I didn't follow you.

At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.

I wish they had never met.

It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!

I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?

Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.

How do you do?

I must talk to my brothers!

Now, Ninotchka... please!

There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....

It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.

What did he say?

Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!

That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.

Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?

Yes, Swana, you did.

I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?

He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?

And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?

Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.

Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.

Where are they?

I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.

My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.

No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.

Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.

Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?

Bring me something simple. I never think about food.

Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...

I am sorry... I have to leave.

For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!

Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.

The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.

Hunt has nothing to lose now.  Pardon all of them.  Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.

He's right.  Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John.  A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate.  What do we have to hide?

How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?

It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.

Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.

Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.

Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention.  If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary!  Was he smoking pot?

I like it.  I like the idea.

Why not?

I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.

No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.

Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?

Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!

Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...

Who?

Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign.

If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.

The army?

We can't survive this, sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.

Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --

... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...

Well, why not?

But what are we paying him for?

But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."

Just do what I say, Bob.

It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.

This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.

No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.

... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...

If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?

... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?

Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.

Mr. President!

And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.

Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.

You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.

So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ...

You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...

... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.

More light, chief?

Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning.

I can't ...

Current levels may not be sufficient.

No.

You'll win the nomination.

Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.

We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.

We took his system out.

Who do you think is behind it?

Where'd you find him?

Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.

Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a helluva party.

By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ...

Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...

So, what's this about, Dick?

Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?!

It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?

No, Henry.  I don't.

Who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ...

This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this.

Yes.

I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.

Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.

What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?

The lie?

Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.

Jesus Christ!

Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.

That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...

Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...

Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...

No, no.  I'm not powerless.  Because ... because I understand the system. I believe I can control it.  Maybe not control it totally.  But ... tame it enough to make it do some good.

So I'm supposed to be ...

And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!

My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?

It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.

Yeah ... I'm out.

Were you planning to tell me?

They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.

It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.

I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.

Congratulations, Dick.

Yes.

Hiding what?

No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.

What?

Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...

Some say you are, Rocky.

Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...

How'd you know I was here.

You heard it?

But -- how'd you know it was mine?

How you been, Ellis?

What would you a done if he'd been released?

...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.

Nineteen zero and nine.

I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.

...I don't know what I do feel like.

Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.

Yes ma'am?

I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.

Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.

What about yours?

Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.

Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.

How's that, Sheriff?

Yessir.

...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.

I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.

I mean, would you care to join me.

...How'd you sleep?

...You got no cause to hurt me.

Not like that. Not like you say.

I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.

What's in the satchel?

...Where'd you get the pistol?

Big talk.

What're you doin', baby?

...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.

Why all the way to Del Rio?

You are comin back, ain't ya?

I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.

What's that.

Did you go up to his trailer?

What airport would you use.

I don't know.

...I know where you are.

You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?

Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.

How much?

Is somethin' wrong?

Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.

The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.

Call it.

Yes.

Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?

...Don't put it in your pocket.

Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.

Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.

Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.

One room, one night.

You on all night?

It's all right.

November the 28th, last year.

He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.

No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.

That's me.

Waitin' for my wife.

Half.

...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.

...But that won't last.

It's called a transponder.

Maybe he should be worried. About me.

...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.

Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?

...I meant your food.

You should get the order you want.

...plenty

Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?

Jesus...

So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?

You're lying!

Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.

Well, do something, then, damnit!

Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?

Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!

You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...

Great. Good. Content...

You must be joking.

Who are these idiots?

...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?

Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?

Well, I certainly would have heard about that.

What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?

Did you watch it yet?

Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.

Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?

I gotta go.

I beg your pardon?

That's very kind of you.

Why do they keep calling you George?

I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...

Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?

Lyla's very nice.

She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.

Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.

David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?

You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?

I have... did it sound that bad?

Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.

Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?

And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...

Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?

That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?

Hi, Betty. You're looking good...

Uh-huh.

Yes.

You're in serious danger!

Shut up, Merle... Williams.

If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.

And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.

Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.

It's something I had to do. For David.

So what do you say? Can we be friends?

Are you sure I can borrow this?

What are you doing?

Blake, I can handle that transplant!

The fuck you talking about?

We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.

Could you give us an example?

All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?

Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?

You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.

I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?

That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...

Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.

What the hell was that, another statement?

Joyce was screwing Del.

No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.

That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!

What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...

She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.

Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?

I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.

What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?

God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?

Did Chloe crack?

You lie, motherfucker...

Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.

I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.

Waitaminute -

You can't do this -

Huh?!

I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.

This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.

Five... hunnert... thousand... each.

Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?

Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!

So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?

A miracle! It was a miracle!

I'm sayin' we har this man away.

What's his name again?

You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.

No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.

Pullin' ah pants down...

No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.

Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.

It's just a symbol, honey -

How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?

To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.

Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved!

Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.

It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.

Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...

Pete... I do apologize.

That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!

Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.

It was a powerful air.

Mama said you was hit by a train!

How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?

I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.

Okay, okay. You win.

Hi, Byron.

Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.

Who gave you this idea?

Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --

She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...

Joe!

Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?

Hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? Come on, man. You're about as close to being officer material as me.

No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.

Mayo, are those your friends?

You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?

Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.

See you in the fleet, sir!

You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?

Where are you from, boy?

What did you call me, Mayo?

Is your brother a flyer?

You're sure it's okay?

Exactly how late are you, Lynette?

Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...

Sid, there's no baby.

I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.

Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.

I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.

No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?

Lynette, where's Sid?

God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?

You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??

I vote for the motel.

Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --

Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?

I don't want you to move.

Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.

Because my real father wouldn't marry her.

I'd like to come with you.

You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.

Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?

You okay?

I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?

What? You've gotta be kidding!

Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.

You're fuckin' A we can do this.

Me.  I am.

Burning me.  It's burning my eye.

You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.

One.  Squeeze.

You got an idea?

That's your problem.

Get the fuck away from me.

WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!

Fuck.

They're not supposed to be here!

Somebody called you?

Can we come in?

One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you --

I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.

Oh, I've seen these...

Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!

Shoulda got an apartment.

Yeah.

Where'd you learn S.O.S.?

He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...

I'm sorry, Mom.

Alma!? I uhh I don't think...

Little Bobby... Just a kid...

Tyrone...

Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?

Lemme see that rifle son...

What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...

You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?

What's up?

No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...

You're Judge right? We need to talk.

So... we understand each other Judge?

Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.

I can't... they don't operate that way...

Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?

Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.

Hey, this what they got you doing now?

You got it. Berkeley?

Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?

C'mon we'll walk and talk...

Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?

Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.

These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.

Rodgers... this is no good...

Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?

We're working on that...

Yeah man, but where's Judge?

We appreciate your help with this.

Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?

I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?

See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce.

You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.

And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?

Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.

Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.

Huh?

What's up with you?

Sorry man...

Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...

Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.

Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?

If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea.

Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.

You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?

He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.

He shouldn't make light.  That Redcoat should not have been killed.

I know him well enough?

How did this... how did I let this happen?

If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.

You're surrendering.

I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.

You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.

Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.

Very well, let us move on to...

And if I triumph, you triumph.

What news?

I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.

And, Corporal...  ... be careful.

Is it?

Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.

Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.

Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?

No, I don't.

That's why it was four years between you and Thomas.  It took me that long to regain her respect.

He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.

An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?

Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.

Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?

We don't have to go to war to gain independence...

Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...

Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.

And your principles?

I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?

Not held, just slowed down.

They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.

And congratulations on the birth of your son.

How far away?

For trying to impose some decency on that sort.

Put those away.

Father, I saw a post rider at the house.

Father?

Father, you can't let them take him...

Father... I killed those men...

But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?

I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!

There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.

Please hurry.

Yes.

Ellie? What's wrong?

I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.

I'm not tired!

Was it Pascow?

You need a glass?

Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.

Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?

Going to tell Ellie?

Yes, but--

What do you mean?

No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?

What are those for?

Doesn't look like they last long.

I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.

I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...

A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.

Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?

--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.

I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--

Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--

Leave me alone!

I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.

Thank you. Thank you so much.

Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.

That's enough of that kind of talk!

I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.

I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.

What's in your head, boy?

You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!

What -- you don't have the medallion?

No, I really think I do.

Why don't I want to do this?

The situation has changed.

No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.

Do you believe him?

My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?

There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?

Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.

You have a name, missy?

Maid or not, it fits you.

Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.

Did he speak?

Commodore, I must protest.  Pirate or not, this man saved my life.

Actually, I find it all fascinating.

Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.

I know the code.

I could never forget it, Miss Swann.

I'm glad we got here in time.

Why would my father send this to me?

I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.

It doesn't!

You are despicable.

You're in league with Barbossa!

Has it changed since the last time you were here?

Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!

Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.

When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!

He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.

Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!

Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.

Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?

What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?

Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

But it seems to be enough to condemn him.

That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.

Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?

Where does it make berth?

I'd die for her.

We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?

Shut up, before you lose them all!

But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--

Do you have any idea where you're going?

There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.

He's still breathing.

Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.

Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.

This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven.  Science is the quest for divine perfection.

What are you going to do to him?

She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.

Icky!  What's happening?

Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?

It will be an ascension.

Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --

Where did he go?

Hey!

Yeah?  So what?

Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.

You were never invited to my house.

Like Crazy Glue?

Sir, please try to hold still.

Yeah.

Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!

So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?

Look at this!

Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!

Just like old times.

You made this out of my hair?

Who is he?

Things do change.

Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!

This is wonderfully accommodating of you all.  Now I won't have to come looking for you.

Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --

It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.

If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it.

Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.

You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.

Will - uh - five thousand be enough?

I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.

I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.

None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.

Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.

Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?

Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.

What's the idea, Anne?

Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?

Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.

That's an excellent idea.

It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!

Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.

Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.

Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.

Hello, there, Meadows![13]

a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.

Fine. Have a seat.

So, you see how silly that rumor is?

Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?

Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?

Yeah.

Yeah, little Gloria.

Right - for the first time this year.

Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.

Araby?

Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.

Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?

I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?

He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.

Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.

For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.

Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.

Thanks, thanks.

Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?

Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.

Remember, she's a Schuyler.

How is her family going to feel about it?

I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.

What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?

Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.

Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.

Did who?

Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?

Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.

Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?

Hey, Gallagher!

No.

Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?

I don't eat waffles.

We just thought that

Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.

Smythe, you've been drinking.

Yes - the worm!

He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!

That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.

What's going on here? Who is this woman?

Heavens! The man's insane!

But I

It's haunted just the same.

That's puttering, sir.

Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.

No. I want to know.

And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.

I just thought ... It's beautiful.

Bud?

Isn't it great how she's resting like that?

Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.

Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.

What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?

I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...

Oh yeah.

Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...

To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.

Don't! Just let go.

And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.

What happened?

Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?

YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!

BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!

It's not in ME.

Mr. Simpson ...

I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.

Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!

Play along?

Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?

I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.

What do you mean?

You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.

I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...

David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.

I had nothing to do with that fire.

D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?

I baked you my oatmeal cookies.

Keeps going ...

How?

Can I open it?

You're gonna forget about me.

I like calling you David.

... Her father.

McIntire's.

Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.

... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...

Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.

OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!

Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ...  Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.

What's wrong?

Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.

Dream come true, hunh?

It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...

Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.

Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --

It's not cool?

Yeah I can't.

What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --

Sure.

....no....

Really?

Thank you. What do you do, Barry?

Hello?

I'm fine. Who is this?

Not very late.

No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?

This makes me very uncomfortable.

Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?

Is it ok if I leave my car you think?

Do you know them.

Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.

It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?

Do you have brothers or sisters?

It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --

Who is it?

How long have you known her?

You like her?

-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?

You see?

Is everything ok?

What happened?

Your portable reed organ....the piano.

Did you pick it up from the street?

Are you learning how to play it?

I don't freak out.

Hello?

HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?

...what...?

Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?

I'm sorry.

It's a plastic, yeah.

If you wanted to call me back I could...

No.

I don't know.

On my knife.

Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --

Hi, is this your first time calling?

And your name?

And your Social Security number.

It's just for verification through the credit card company.

It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.

I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.

You do guaranteed sale? etc.

How's business?

What's up?

...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?

Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.

I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --

How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --

What is this?

Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?

What's up?

What happened?

I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.

Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.

I need to talk to you for a second.

Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....

They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...

This is Barry.

Yes I am.

Seven o'clock.

I won't.

I know.

I'll see you there.

I don't really remember that.

I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?

I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.

You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.

Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.

Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.

Marquis? Is that you?

Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.

Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?

Has he hurt you?

I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --

Free his mouth.

Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?

I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?

It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.

It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.

Mightier than the sword indeed.

Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.

If you only mean to dupe me again --

Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --

-- water! --

I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!

I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!

IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.

Who's to say I did not?

Abbe de Coulmier!

Of course.

I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.

Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?

And he's never once attempted escape?

On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself --

Well?

I have.

You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --

This child let loose the beast from its cage --

If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.

As you say, Doctor.

And you? It must've been an ordeal.

But I am history.

I'll be waiting.

I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"

It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.

The peril of composing such incendiary prose...

If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.

The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.

A kiss for each page.

It's a long story, this one.

The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.

They've taken your clothes?

Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!

-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!

A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!

You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?

Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...

But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?

If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --

-- words alone are insufficient.

We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.

And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!

Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.

And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.

See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?

It's not really--

How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?

That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.

It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.

Why did we not know about this sooner?

Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?

Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.

That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.

That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.

So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.

Manolete?!

The great Spanish bullfighter

"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?

This better be good

Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--

I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--

Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--

It doesn't have to be

All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--

The title?

Hey, kid. Gregg.

Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating.

This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.

They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.

Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!

Very generous

"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.

Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-

The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!

What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about

Well it' s all you've got !

How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!

I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!

They wanna talk to you.

I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.

Hey champ!

All right. I don't have to hear any more. I think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don't raise your hands. You don't do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but no more after this. You understand?

You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.

You're a good sport, lady.

Yeah --

Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.

I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.

You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.

Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!

Say what you're gonna say.

Whatcha doin'?

Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.

Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.

You know, when you gave him a beatin'.

Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?

Whatever you touched, that's good now.

What?

Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.

What do you mean, "you"?

Did you ever fuck my wife?

I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.

Did you ever fuck my wife?

I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.

It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.

Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!

It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.

I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.

You go first. Let me watch how to do this.

Just keep your eye on the ball.

Jake...

Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...

But, Jake, I was just...

Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?

What was it about?

Come out of there! Did you fuck Salvy?  Answer me. Open this fuckin' door, you fuckin' cunt!  Who've you been fuckin'?

I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.

Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.

How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?

All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?

Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.

I said, let's go.

Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.

No, you're his wife.

I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.

Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.

I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.

Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.

You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?

I can't do it even if he's gone.

You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?

Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?

But I'm not a killer!

Tom, I've got something real big for you.

Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.

I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.

Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.

I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!

In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?

Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.

Wrong day?

Where?

Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?

Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.

Something wrong?

Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.

Can you get me that ring back?

I can't. The police have it by now.

Readers' Digest, April, 1939.

That's normal.

She's only perfect.

It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.

A Federal offense.

You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?

There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?

You shouldn't have let her do that! If he ever --

You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.

What are you two talking about?

Anything else bothering you?

The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?

Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.

I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.

Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.

Yes.

Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.

Almost as if it were being written especially for us.

What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.

Lisa, simmer down -- will you?

Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.

Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --

Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.

Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?

I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.

Don't you ever have any problems?

So do I.

I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.

What is it you're looking for?

Maybe she died.

No comment.

It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.

I have the whole weekend off.

Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.

Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?

I hate funny exit lines.

Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.

Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.

Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.

Shut up. I'm all right.

Meaning me?

No.  We're going to bring him down.

What time is it?

You buy me many things.  Thank you.

What would you do, Dad?

What can you do when you have to be a man?

Will you let him tell it!

Son--this is all happening so fast--

He depended on me.

I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.

No thanks, I don't smoke.

I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.

I was talking to Jim.

Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--

Are you going down there?

See?  It stopped.

She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.

What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?

What's your name!

He has a knife.

I'm here.

Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.

It's me!

They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?

Isn't it crazy?

Isn't he schizoid?

When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.

Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?

You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?

I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?

You sure?

'Bye, Mom.

I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.

No.

They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.

What a zoo!

I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.

Assault with a deadly weapon.

See?

Yeah--why--

No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?

Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.

Sure.  Lots of times.

You can trust me, Judy.

Want to read any books?  Take your pick!  Isn't this the craziest?

Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--

I never felt so clean before.

Is he your friend?

Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.

I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?

He makes you feel pretty unhappy?

How did you know that?

But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!

A man of some travels.

Is this him!?

All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...

I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.

We sell children's toys --

Negative five?

I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --

Do that again.

No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.

Well, wasn't all me, y'know.

Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --

Well, I don't know about that --

We'll have more fun in Detroit.

Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --

When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!

My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.

No!

Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?

He working for them on this one?

They've never done a robbery?

Nick, what happened --

We get to the bridge, we're all right!

He wants to see your map.

How are we gonna do this, Nick?

Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.

What?

You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.

No --

You... you don't know me --

Who are you now.

So you could get with my sister.

What's her middle name?

What'd they call her in high school?

What'd they call her in college?

What's her greatest fear?

The hell you don't.

Hell. Ten?

I did.

You got one hour.

Got something to say to me, Nick?

Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.

So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six.

NO.

No gun.

Ash?

How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?

Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...

Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.

This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.

Hell yeah. You work here long?

What the hell was that about --

What about the money?

There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...

We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.

Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.

Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.

What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.

All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.

GUARD! GUARD!

Ash... Ashley...

Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.

Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --

That was my king!

Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.

I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -

I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?

You fuckin' wish.

Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.

I'll call somebody.

I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.

I don't know, but somebody did.

I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?

Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.

Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.

The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."

No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.

Who, Mr. White?

The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.

What kinds questions did Cabot ask?

Myself and Mr. Pink?

Just hold on buddy boy.

I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.

Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?

I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.

What for?

Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?

Aren't you?

Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.

That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!

Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?

Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.

Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.

Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!

I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.

Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.

Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?

Gun shot.

Dead.

How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.

I'm cool.

Want a smoke?

What's wrong with it?

As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.

No real people?

Could you believe Mr. Blonde?

At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.

Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?

Nope.

So, is he dead or what?

Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.

And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?

You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!

He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long.

What's the matter with her?

We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.

You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.

She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.

Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.

Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?

I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.

You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?

I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.

Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.

Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.

I found their surrey --

Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.

Stretch out under the seat, Miss.

But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?

Why?

They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.

Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...

Go on, hit me.

You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.

You're not bein' quite fair.

Don't act so -- crazy.

Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --

I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.

What is it?

Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.

I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.

What's the matter -- restless?

Suppose I take a look.

I tried my best, but these things take time.

You're not giving up?

We might as well start a fire.

I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.

Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.

You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?

Clay Phillips.

Because there's a man I want to see.

We got company. Female company.

Why, yes. They're all I need...

He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.

Gee, I can't.

What comes after Z?

And that's tough, isn't it?

U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?

What do they look like?

Well, Steve?

Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.

Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.

You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.

Are you okay?

That's always tough. How long were you together?

Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --

We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.

Thanks.

Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!

No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.

No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.

So, I guess I can go now.

Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.

He's right. I should go first.

Where's Shorty?

You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...

We should act out our inner most fantasies.

Feel that?

Cindy, let me...

Listen to me I --

Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.

Hey, look out, a bee!

What should we get?

Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?

Hanson, please.

Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."

Would you like me to help you pass them back?

What the hell are you doing?

He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.

So, do you think you made it into the class?

Huh?

Hey, y'all! What's going on?

Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?

Let me help you.

That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.

Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.

Are those cameras all throughout the house?

I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.

Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.

Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?

It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.

You never could feel your legs.

Alright... I might need your help.

Father.

Would you like to see the girl?

Father, are you okay?

This part removes the sense of humor.

"Ray!"

What a bitch!

Mrs. Sutphin?

You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"

No comment!

Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.

Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.

CHIP!!

Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?

Are you Chip Sutphin?

TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!

What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.

Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!

Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!

There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee! He's here every morning for breakfast.

Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 

Objection! Argumentative!

Hello.

Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!

Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...

So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?

Ooohhhhhh! I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life!

He killed people, Mom.

I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!

Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!

It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?

You got your wish.

Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?

Mrs... Sutphin?

What was that?

I'll give you fifty cents.

I'll take this instead.

Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.

The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.

I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.

Let's get out of here.

It's only a little way, Mr. August.

When I wanted to.

Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?

Are you Dr. Louis Judd?

I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.

How's Miss Jacqueline?

I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you - had your picture in her office.

I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.

Redi's all right.

It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.

Do you know what this is, Frances?

Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.

We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,

Yes, of course  but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.

However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.

Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --

I thought I might close up the apartment -- maybe get a place in Connecticut.

That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here -

But I'm not joking.

She'll have to know some time.

And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.

Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.

I have been at the library.

I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.

Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.

I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.

You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?

Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.

What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?

I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.

Following me to find Jacqueline?

Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.

And this poetry  like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?

I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.

Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.

Would they hurt her?

But you would like to know where she is?

I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.

Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...

Is it about Jacqueline?

I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.

But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.

I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.

But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --

I didn't know.

There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?

If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.

I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.

Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?

That makes it all the more difficult 

But he also wrote --

We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --

Have you ever been on television?

No, I think you look... fine.

No, not really.

You mean like "time flies"?

Why'd you drop out?

That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.

I don't know.

Would you mind?

Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.

Do you want them?

Well... are you self-conscious about it?

Aren't you?

Well, my therapist knows me intimately.

So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.

Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.

Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.

No.

What will you do when the money runs out?

Do you talk to him?

Is he going to see this?

No.

Why not?

Can't.

That's correct.

Her name was Elizabeth.

The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".

How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?

If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?

Interesting analogy.

If you were in love with me, would you?

But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.

I've told you.

You mean you're still in contact with her?

Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?

But that was part of it?

I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --

I want to touch you.

That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.

John?

Yes. I just got busy.

Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know.

Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?

No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.

There's nothing to know, Ann.

Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.

I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.

Loud.

Where did you go when you left here?

Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?

God damn you!!

What upsets you about that?

This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?

When did you begin having this feeling?

Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?

Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --

No, he left last week.

I don't know. He went to school here, then he was in New York for awhile, then Philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around.

What?

I say it because it's descriptive.

"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?

Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?

Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --

Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.

Thank you.

I get real busy between two and four.

Who are you?

Do I know you?

The extrovert.

Oh, okay. I think I get it.

Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?

And that's all?

Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?

How long will it take?

Do I sit or stand?

Describe for me your first sexual experience.

Your first sexual experience.

What did you think? Did it look like you expected?

Were you disappointed?

What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?

John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.

Hello.

No. You'll have to get somebody else.

Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.

I've got to get back to the office.

I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.

Not today. I've got other plans.

Hello.

Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?

I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.

It won't. I trust him.

Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?

Who?

Plus first and last month deposit.

Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.

Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.

John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.

IBM.

One moment.

Mr. Millaney?

You're the one who found the bodies?

Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?

Medical clinic?

OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.

Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?

Where is he now? Do you know?

I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.

You say something?

Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?

Good shape for an old man, eh?

Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.

I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?

Yes?

Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.

OK, I bite. What does it look like?

OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.

GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY

BREAKING OUT

BREAKING OUT

You bet, Bert.

How's Brad?

They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn.

Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?

In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.

Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?

Out of self comes selflessness.

In a way...

Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?

Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.

Care to indulge?

Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?

SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION

I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART

YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART

SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT

YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE

We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?

Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.

Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed?

Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...

Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?

I'm...happy.

You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!

Let's hear the five 'F's' for today.  F for...

F for...

F for...

Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.

THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE

Isn't she lovely?

Bye.

Glass or bottle?

You okay, Miles?

Is it chicken?

I'm thinking about the duck breast.

I can explain.

Are you a writer too?

Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.

Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?

There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.

Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.

Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --

Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?

Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?

Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.

Baked with a butter-lime glaze.

Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.

It does. Feels right.

Yeah. Tight.

Sure I know Maya.

Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.

Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?

Have you no shame?

So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?

She what?  When?

And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.

Oh, boy.

Where is Stephanie?

Besides what?

Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?

What about your agent? Hear anything yet?

What do you think's going on?

Don't come over the top. Stay still.

What is it?

We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?

Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?

Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?

Don't give up. You're going to make it.

Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?

So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.

I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.

I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.

She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.

You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.

Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.

Me?

Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...

Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?

Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.

Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.

On a Sauvignon Blanc?

This is good. Little hints of clove.

Are you all right?

Hi.

She got anything good?

Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.

It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.

Bathroom over there?

You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?

You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.

About two-thirty.

Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...

Victoria! How the hell are you?

Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.

Where are you?

I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?

Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.

Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.

So what do you think?

What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.

So what are you up to today, Miles?

Oops. Sorry.

It was a surprise, Mom.

What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?

What are you thinking about?

No.

See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.

The same windows.

I see.

Explain, act crazy?

It was very dark.

It was very dark.

This guy got on the roof in like a second.

Morgan, be careful.

They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.

Should we turn off the lights?

He was only a year and half old.

It's getting stronger.

We might lose the signal.

Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.

Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?

Stop crying!

They'll read our minds!

Did someone save me?

It's the strangest thing Father.

What's that?

You said something was strange. What's strange?

It's not broken.

I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --

It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.

Don't do it!

All I did was kiss a girl.

Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.

Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.

Forget it.

Maybe we'll see you sometime.

I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.

I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.

Goodbye?

You don't make it easy on a fellow.

Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.

Are you all right?

This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.

I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?

South of here, past Chimayo.

Women?

C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.

You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.

Daddy?

Where is Rae?

Who?

You own this land.

He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.

J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.

It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.

You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?

That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.

Get out of here, Jake.

What are you talking about?

I don't like that word much, Carter.

I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.

Why are they doing this, Mal?

This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.

What brings you into my saloon?

Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.

I told you this was a sweet set-up.

What is it you want from me?

I'm a great believer in doing nothing.

Where's the dog now?

How about you?

We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.

I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor now.

I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.

Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.

Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.

The public decides who's on that list.

You're not renewing my contract.

Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."

Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.

Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.

I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.

I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?

-- You can't go in there!

Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.

My two favorite girls.

That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.

I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.

Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.

You look so, so...

What I do to Simone?

-- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"

With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.

That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.

And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.

Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.

How will you do our love scenes?

You can't.

-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.

You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.

I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.

-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.

You have to see her.

Not quite how I imagined it --

Me too.

She thinks you're with Simone.

I love you, Lainey.

-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.

So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.

The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.

Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.

I've done my homework.  I've studied her.

Is it a jamming device?

We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.

-- Nicola!  How was your massage?

I beg you.  You can't do this to me.

Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.

I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.

Good morning, Simone.

Maybe he can.

The only real truth is in the work.

Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.

Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.

Don't step in the horse manure.

Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.

No.

You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?

Know what?

What do you want more than anything?

I have to.

Are you wigging out?

We're not gonna start crying again, are we?

You really look better.

You have nice red in your cheeks now.

It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?

I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.

What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?

You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?

There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?

You know that accident up there?

Someone got hurt.

Cole, you're scaring me.

Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!

Good for you.

Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.

'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.

Maybe you don't want to remember.

Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.

Could take a little while, though.

Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?

See?

Witch.

No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.

I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...

AAAAAAAAAAAA --

You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?

Hey. Fuck you.

Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.

Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"

Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!

Should we be doing this, dude?

He means moon shining.

What are you going to do? Shoot me?

Joseph Macdonald... Your son.

I came back for the funeral. That's all.

How... was she "called?"

Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.

-- And keep your eyes on the road.

You know what they say about men who need big guns...

You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.

Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.

Chicken sandwich?

You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.

Is that right?

Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --

I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --

Suzie --

Suzie... No.

Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod?

Like your guitar break.

-- Where have you two been?

Shit.

Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!

Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.

Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?

No reception out here.

Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.

That wasn't a good night, no.

After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!

We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.

Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --

Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.

Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.

Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.

My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?

Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?

It's just a work thing.

That's not true -- Where are you--?

I never danced in a towel before.

Welcome home.

Four hundred cases worth.  Well?

Kate McConnell.

Why're you driving so fast?

Why? You have a bowling date?

Who'd want to?

A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.

So tell me about yourself.

Can I ask you something?

Hey...

By stealing my car?

Where did you learn how to drive like this?

-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?

Kate...

They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.

Well, at least it hasn't been boring.

What can I say?

What are you thinking?

Order up!

That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.

All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.

Bandit?

Shit! No one's here.

You know how to drive one of these things?

Hit the brakes!

I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.

She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.

-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.

I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.

I hate to say it...

-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...

Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.

We're outta motion lotion.

It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.

I would say your future's looking dim, boss.

It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.

I think you're just yellow.

Have any trouble getting here?

Uh-uh. What Cobra?

Oh, yeah. Good for him.

Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.

This is Bandit I. Over.

I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.

Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?

That crazy sumbitch made it.

It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.

Yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.

Is your security team armed?

I tell you, engineering this kind of play against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to... they're playing some long odds.

Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.

Two of 'em?

Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.

There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.

I'm here, where's the car?

What happened?

What'd you say?

About what?

I could have it sent out...

Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.

On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.

Here. Sit.   Please.

Where's Israel?

My debrief --

You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --

I wouldn't go that far.

Buzzy... Buzz...?

Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.

Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.

Buzzy... Buzz...?

So how we lookin'?

Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?

-- never in a million girl --

My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?

That takes some of the sting out.

What were you doin' here anyway?

Why?

They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.

You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.

Listen --

No.  There's no behavior modification.

That's fantastic.

It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.

You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?

Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition.

Probably.

Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?

You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --

If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?

Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.

Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.

Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --

What do you want to do, leave the station with her?

You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?

What's wrong with you?  We need your help.

Don't.

"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".

Not a very happy poem.

You want to fuck her?

You go home.

Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.

Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.

You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.

Why did she do it?

You're the coward.

I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.

That won't happen again.  We're different.

No.

That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.

How can you be here...

They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.

Claire!

Occasionally.

Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.

I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.

You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?

And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!

What about Neil?

What's to like?

You asked.

Good night, Mike.

You put me life in danger.

I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.

Yeah.

I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.

They guys treatin' you all right?

I'd miss my life...

I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.

... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...

You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...

We're not going to the game, are we Mom?

Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?

I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.

She's got to identify him.

Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?

I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?

I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.

We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!

Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.

Yes.

... Hard?

You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.

I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.

Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!

Watch your step!

Nice threads Dad.

Shooting.

Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.

Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.

Here you go, Pete.

What, want a glass?

Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?

When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.

Lizzy!

Flash, get lost.

You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.

You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?

Are you okay?

Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--

Can we make it a hundred?

No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.

What's this? A cockaroach?

An even five I throw in the jacket.

He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.

Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.

Some things you should say anyway.

I hate--

No.  I was lying about the coffee.

He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.

This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?

They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.

Well, no.

Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?

Hello, Liz.

Waldos.

Toxic dumps, huh.

You sure about all this?

The record--

What the hell is that?

Peter, you're bleeding.

Poison emergency.

Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.

What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.

You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.

Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.

My self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.

Peter, what can I do for you?

You never know.  Go get some sleep.

No

I asked if you felt like a drink--

Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--

I sent for  the police.  We can explain.

He'll try to finish his experiment.

A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.

Jawohl.

We made a deal with Barrack One.

Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.

Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?

Come on!

What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?

That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?

Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?

You make my mouth water.

Have a cigar.

Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.

Break it off!

How did he get over there?

That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.

What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?

105-353.

I'm okay here. Why bother?

There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.

And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.

Interesting.

Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?

Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?

'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'

Look at me! I'm your baby!  Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!

It's chow, Animal! Chow!

How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.

Easy, Animal! Easy!

Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!

Not for me! Betty! Betty!

You'll fix me up!

You did?

Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!

Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?

Do Grable.

You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!

May I have this dance, Miss?

Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.

You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.

What are you going to do?

I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.

Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?

What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.

Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.

We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.

You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.

Anybody call?

Says me.

Lay off, Sefton.

What's the matter, boys? Is my slip showing?

You heard that, Sefton?

You off your rocker?

I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy.

You could use a new one yourself.

Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!

When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.

So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.

Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.

Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?

Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?

Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?

We have no radio.

Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?

You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?

What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?

Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?

That is my wife.

Is it all right if we smell it?

You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.

Have a nice time over there?

So you're stuck with me, eh?

It's working.

Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.

That's where he's going.

The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.

I don't see a control panel, or an access port.

Data, are you all right?

I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.

Can you locate them?

That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.

But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.

These are my children...my children.

I don't understand.

You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-

This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.

Close to retirement?

Yes.  Thank you.

Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?

Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.

Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?

What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?

Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.

Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.

Counselor. What can I do for you?

Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.

You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.

I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.

These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.

As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.

Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.

Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.

What's going on? When do we get paid off...?

Mr. Chekov -- ?

Will we get another ship?

You did great, Bones... Just great.

What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.

Still no response, sir.

Nothing on my scanner, sir.

Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.

I don't believe it...

David, I don't understand...

Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.

It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!

Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.

You mean, we're stranded down here?!

Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!

The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...

Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.

I don't understand.

Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...

As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.

Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.

How many more?

The Genesis planet is gone.

... We have cleared Spacedoors.

We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.

That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?

If I read this right, sir, we have full power.

Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.

Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?

Will you be able to handle that...?

No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.

You're right.  Thanks for the drink.

Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.

Wait! Give me a chance --

There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!

Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...

... He spoke of your friendship.

He asked you not to grieve...

I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!

Bones!...

I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.

Firing range, sir.

Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.

Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!

It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?

Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!

Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --

It never rains but when it pours --

Khan could be down there!

Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?

Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --

Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.

... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...

Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...

I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --

David --

Jim --

You're crazy -- !

I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.

To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.

I'm Admiral Kirk...

I don't mean to intrude.

I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.

-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.

You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.

We'll be going to warp speed --

Just barely, sir.

Uhura. Can't you augment?

... No response, sir.

The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.

If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.

I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.

Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?

There's a first time for everything, Admiral.

That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.

But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...

I would not presume to debate you.

What's she doing here?

Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.

Affirmative, Admiral.

Uh oh.

Very well.

How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?

May I speak, sir?

Indeterminate life signs.

Cease fire. Look sharp.

Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...

Mr. Sulu... The shields!

I can't get power, sir!

Shields activated!

I do not understand the final question...

Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?

Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.

Are you sure?  That's what I thought.

That's crazy!

Hi... Busy?

Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.

Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?

10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.

You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.

Guess, Spock. Your best guess.

What the hell do you think you're doing?

Find it?

Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...

... It gives me a great sense of history.

Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.

No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.

Shields, Mr. Chekov.

Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.

Status report, Admiral!

"Neutralized?" How?

So you were at Berkeley.

Can I ask <u>you</u> something?

They're gonna hafta take their chances.

All right. Who are you? and don't jerk me around any more. I want to know how you know that.

So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?

Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?

You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.

Wanna try it from the top?

... Who are you?

Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.

Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?

I bet you're a damn good poker player.

Steady, now. We need your help.

Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?

You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.

You tricked me.

... What does that mean?

You mean this is -- goodbye?

Where are you going?!

Spock...?

Is there any other planet where this species exists?

The late 20th Century.

Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.

Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.

Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?

Spock...

Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.

You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.

Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!

Can we make breakaway speed!?

Warp two... three...

Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!

Aye, sir. Descending.

Ready sir.

Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.

What is it?

Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?

I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.

Bearing!

Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.

Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.

They're giving out. De-crystallizing.

I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?

What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --

Admiral! There be whales here!

Full power, sir.

And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.

Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself!  The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people!  We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!

Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --

With pleasure.

Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?

Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?

Hi.

Father...?

We were under the impression they were being held against their will.

My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.

I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...

I don't like to leave questions unanswered.

I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?

Deceive us?

Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.

I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.

You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice.  Would you be his friend Gal'na?  I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.

There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.

I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.

Don't you ever get tired?

Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?

No... I want to stay with you...

Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...

Will he live?

Hello, Data...

I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.

Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...

Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...

We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...

Captain, I wasn't expecting you.

... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...

That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...

I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.

The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.

Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.

What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...

Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...

His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...

Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...

If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.

Will that stop the tear?

That's your expert opinion?

We're pulling it like a zipper across space...

I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...

The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.

What's inside that nebula cluster?

I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...

Who is it?

Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...

Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...

There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...

I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...

He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.

He's activated a transport inhibitor.

Scanners are off line!

The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!

You need a haircut, Commander.

Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.

... Population three hundred million...

We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.

It's Cochrane.

What are we waiting for? Let's go.

Are you saying they won't help us?

He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?

Is it Japanese?

There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.

I have helm control.

The vortex is collapsing, sir.

The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology.  So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.

Juice?

Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.

This must be it.

I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.

This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.

Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.

Where are you from most recently?

Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...

There is no invasion...

Did you need something?

No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.

What?

What makes you say that?

We?

Life signs?

Track their weapons fire.

Port battery, ready sir!

Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.

Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.

Target locked!

Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.

We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...

I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.

We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.

Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.

And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.

Emergency override!

Wil... Data was down there.

All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.

I remember it made me sick.

I have to admit there was a moment there when --

What the hell happened down there, Worf?

Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.

Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?

Mr. President.

I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.

Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...

That was the general idea I intended to convey.

Specifically of...?

Jim, leave me - I'm finished...

Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.

Are you carrying a surgeon?

For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.

Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?

I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.

What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?

It takes a lot of effort.

My God, what happened here?

WHAT HAPPENED?

Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?

Spoken by you?

You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?

Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?

Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...

Course heading, Captain?

You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...

Now we expand our search to include uniforms.

An INCIDENT?

Thank you, Captain.

An accident wasn't good enough...

Isn't it about time you became something else?

What took you so long?

He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.

And your coat.

I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.

Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.

We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...

Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...

Just the prototype.

I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.

Surely not.

According to my information, today.

WE volunteered?

We HAVEN'T fired -

Control tower, reading, Sir.

Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...

You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.

Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?

In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.

Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.

It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.

They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...

They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.

A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!

I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.

You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?

Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.

Fuzzy face is gone.

Do you know who I am?

Why?

Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?

I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I dont show up for my physical on time!

Remember him?

Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.

The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.

As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.

And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?

And this makes you "sad"?

Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander.

What do you imagine this is?

Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.

But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.

Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.

May I have this dance?

Counselor.

I'm going to miss you.

I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.

Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.

How can you be certain?

But how can he? He'll kill you.

The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.

Open a channel.

It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.

Cannon fodder.

I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.

Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.

How long until he can fire?

Prepare for a site-to-site transport.

Sir, we're being hailed.

Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.

Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.

It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.

Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.

Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.

Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.

What's this?

Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --

We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.

She's not out for a pleasure cruise.

But she's not the Enterprise.

On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.

But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.

Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.

And you dreamed about what was up there. About...

If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.

In time, Jean Luc.

All of this so you could capture me?

Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.

It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.

Target disruptors. Destroy them.

So theyve got him up and running.

It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.

How many Warbirds will you need?

Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.

And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?

Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?

The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.

Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?

Right in line with that burning tree.

I'll take that.

Credit card.

Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.

Do you have children?

Where did you stop last?

I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...

Then it's not an accident that they found us.

That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.

Clarify that.

I don't like it, George...

What's all this for?

We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.

George... Do you hear me, George?

I want to speak to Marc Shermin.

If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.

Steering wheel.

Dashboard.

What?

Smile... good?

Minneapolis... good.

Go.

What?

That's a big help. Where are you from?

No, no... don't say that. Bad word.

In your pocket, please...

I want to try it.

What's the matter?

Sun...

Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?

Say it.

Well... I'm going to go now.

You thought we were a different planet?!

Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'

The captain...

It's bad.

Put that back.

Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.

Hello... hello. How are you this morning?

How long will it take you to get home?

I told you I'm looking for someone.

Is it for real?

That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.

Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.

You have no conception of this, do you?

We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.

To the same woman?

Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.

I don't understand.

I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'

Is there a reward in this?

That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.

I made my choice, Lenny.

Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.

You can't just... kill him.

I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'

Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.

No.

Clips.

What kind of things exactly?

You were lucky, Max.

See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.

You alright?  Y'okay?

Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.

Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.

How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?

Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...

Charm.

Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--

Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.

What the fuck are you doing?

Are we having a bad night?

Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?

I need my case.  It's still in the back.

Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.

You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.

What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.

See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.

She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.

If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.

I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.

Whatup Lenny?

Lenny, give them the tape.

Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!

The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...

Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.

I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.

Hey, Lenny.  We made it.

Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?

We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.

But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 

Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.

Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.

So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!

Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!

Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?

Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.

I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.

Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?

I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?

A grill pattern.

Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.

Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.

Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.

Jesus.

Look...

Excuse me?

Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.

You're going to miss it. Pay attention.

He was sitting here?

Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.

You have the photo from the diner?

Speck. Harold Speck.

Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.

I'll take it into consideration.

I'm hesitant to...

There was talk of a file photo.

Don't you touch him.

You are so fucked up.

Some kids found you in a garbage dump.

Yes I do.

Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."

He thinks he looks young.

Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?

I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?

You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.

Find the feet?

The tattoo?

You mean --

Did they disconnect Testa's computer?

No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.

This feels like something out of a spy novel.

You were right. He found me.

I'd be real careful if I were you.

You're putting me in a difficult position.

Tom, you okay?

It's quite advanced.

You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.

Agent...

Agent Mackelway?

Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.

How's the arm?

Suspect Zero?

I don't carry it with me.

And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.

There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.

If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.

We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.

This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.

I've been to Chicago.

This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.

Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?

Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.

But why attack an Agent?

How far is Amarillo?

I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.

You have to put things in perspective.

Are you calling Her?

Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...

...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.

I thought I was going to die.

Like what?

What else?

Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.

Charles! What's up, man?

Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?

Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.

Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.

You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.

Why not?

Already? You poor thing. It won't last.

Sorry, it's just that...

Me too.

I'll be around.

I'll have to come see you sometime.

How's it going? It's been a while...

Yeah.

...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...

I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.

And what if I don't want to give up on her?

So I don't call either way.

So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.

I mean, I need the money.

I'll give you an eight. 

So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?

That doesn't sound too good for business.

Darwinism at its best.

Him?

No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.

I'm such an asshole.

You little bitch!

It's kinda money, actually.

Pause it. 

What's he do?

...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...

Who threw this party, anyway?

She was cute.

Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 

Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 

Wait.

What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.

No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.

Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.

That's where we make our scene.

I'm telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven.

Always, baby.

Baby, don't talk like that, baby.

Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.

Mikey's the big winner.

What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?

I don't think so.

You think so?

That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.

Nice, baby.

You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.

I'm Mike...  and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent".

Oh... a Dorothy.

What was the part?

She was hot.

I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?

Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.

I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.

What time's this party tonight?

Which one?

How long do I wait to call?

What the fuck..?

Because he's a bitch.

I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.

Is she looking at me, baby?

Now?

...and you got big claws and fangs...

...you're so fuckin mmmoney.

...Anaheim...

...Sue...

It's on...

The bear's got his claws back.

And you?

But your daughter is still alive.

Be my friend.

Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.

You take care of Paulie?

Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.

You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.

Outside.

I'll think about it.

Good for ten men...

Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.

When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?

You mean Tattaglia.

And this?

No, I wanted other things for you.

Beautiful all over, eh?

Mike!  The party starting!

Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.

Is the hospital covered?

What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca.  That worries me.

Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.

Will you give this letter to Michael.

I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.

Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?

I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.

No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You wouldn't like him.

Then Luca turned to the other man...

If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?

What will your father say?

Would you like me better if I were a nun?

Can you say it?

I can't...

Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?

Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.

Your sister wants to ask you something.

All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?

How can you be sure?

And all his works?

Do you wish to be baptized?

Buy me out?...

The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!

You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?

Uncanny!

Shut up.

Okay.  And did we know each other?

You know, a primer.

It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.

Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --

You're breaking my ribs!

I know. I write like a child.

I didn't mean with you in it.

Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?

Get undressed in your own room, would you?

He's downstairs.

What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?

What are you talking about?

She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.

What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?

I wanted to tell you my plan.

I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.

How?

Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.

What?

The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --

This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.

Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.

Do you think you can steer this thing?

How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?

I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.

Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?  I'd pay you. I'd pay you 1000 dollars.

Yes it is.

Tom.

Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.

This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.

Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.

Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.

I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?

You really should go in, it's marvelous.

Dickie!

How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?

I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.

How long's he staying for?

Where does Dickie live?

I was looking forward to seeing him.

Very.

He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --

I told you! I knew it!

How would you know that?

We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating.

You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?

The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.

Show me the other one again.  I like them both.

No, I absolutely understand. Of course.

You're kidding.

Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.

Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private! 

Will we see you later?

Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.

Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.

Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?

I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.

Are you okay?

Tom, are you okay?

Hello. What are you up to?

What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.

Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful...

Dickie Greenleaf?

It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?

Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.

Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.

I really don't want to see anybody.

Thank you.

I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.

I have!

Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?

Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?

Well, we're all working tonight.

Really?

The moon?

Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.

You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.

That would have been quite a coincidence.

Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.

You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.

You didn't have to spend your money -- ?

So you haven't heard this record yet?

Damn.

What about the record?

No, I didn't forget "sexy".

Oh, Tom, please.

Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?

How long has he been there?

Try holding the match like this.

No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.

As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.

Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?

No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.

You run all over town, don't you, Travis?

Why you hang around with them greasers?

That ain't much of a name.

What's your real name?

Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!

...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...

Where?

I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.

But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.

I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.

Why not?

You a narc?

God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.

God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.

You don't have to.

Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?

So whatja do now?

You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night?

Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.

Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.

Also clean.

Are you a Secret Service Man?

Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?

Is that so?

Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.

I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.

Wha -- ?

Get it.

Wiz?

Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...

I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.

Could we change the subject?

Stick with Carla.

Maybe.  Not really.

He's got a gun, sir.

Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.

I don't understand....

What are you doing?

Hi.

How'd it go?

He doesn't remember anything, Delly.  Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone...

Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.

Me too.

You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.

Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.

So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?

Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?

You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?

No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...

What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?

What... do you remember?

I see...

Sir, that is true.

Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.

Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?

Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?

Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?

Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?

Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.

I'm a little hesitant to say.

Only one in town.  Get in, son.

Thanks for the lift, Cecil.

No wallet, huh?

"It's a Wonderful Life?"

C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou.

Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.

And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.

Nine and-a-half years ago.

We've been closed for a while.

They couldn't wait to see you.

Yes?

You bet.

Well...

Beautiful, wasn't it?

Did I what?

Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.

Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.

Here, one of mine.

That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.

You kids off to the dance?

Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?

Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?

You should watch what you say.

Kid, that cuts no ice with them.

Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...

Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.

Cigarette?

Why not?

Oh god, oh, god, no, I...

I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.

I can play the piano?

They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.

Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?

What happened?

He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?

I suppose.  Thanks.

You hungry, son?

Did you drive up from San Francisco?

It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?

That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?

Miss Daniels? Is that you?

Thank you.

I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.

Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.

And what had you done?

I'm sorry. Forgive me.

Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.

Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.

Mother!

Miss Daniels?

Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?

Mitch, let's turn back.

Lois!

Good morning.

See where I'm pointing?

And the white house?

Of course.

Thank you.

I wonder if you could tell me...

Yes?

What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.

Oh. I see.

Across at Brinkmeyer's.

You did say birds?

Seven o'clock, same as usual.

And certainly pretty.

You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.

Yes?

Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.

Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?

When do you think they'll come?

Maybe we ought to leave.

When?

I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!

They won't be.

We'll worry about that when we get there.

Then he saw.

I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.

Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.

Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.

'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.

What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.

Does this room look silly?

He was killed last night. By birds.

He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....

Sixty...  Oh.

Oh.

I understand completely, sir.

Some of them are.

When?

You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...

What's that?

Ouch!

We... we went to school together. College.

Certainly, but...

I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.

You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?

...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...

...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?

What did it say?

Do you expect me to believe...?

That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.

And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...

Do you know what I was doing in that shop?

I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.

Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...

Melanie, Melanie...

The town looks clear.

Can we turn back?

I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...

Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.

I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?

No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?

They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.

The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.

And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?

How do you plan to do that?

Scotch, light on the water.

We need them.

Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.

Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.

I'm Donald Fettes.

Mr. Gray?

I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.

-- pain -- and shock.  She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.  Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.

I'm cold as ice.

Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?

I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --

But Richardson?

You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?

Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?

But you did promise.

Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.

I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?

I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.

I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.

What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?

Hear him?

I thought this was a school day.

You'll not need that again, Georgina.

Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.

You're a teacher, eh?  Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.

Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.

Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.

You know something about the human body, Gray.

And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.

Have another glass of something good, Toddy.

I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.

You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?

You and I should work together.

How long ago?

Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.

I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.

I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.

You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.

Crony indeed!

around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?

How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?

Was that it? Well, ok.

You think I'm crazy.

Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.

You killed her. I saw it.

Sssshhh. She's resting.

Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.

We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar."

You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!

Not my arm! What you fucking want?

Yeah, no kidding.

This is where it happened. Right over here.

This tree. Here's where it happened.

It's ok, it's ok...

Erin. Who?

Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.

How about sign of a big black bird?

Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.

An accident, Nathan.

If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?

Look, can I just call a cab?

What is it?

It still doesn't mean...

Stay away from me! Stay away!

They killed her because she found out.

You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!

The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!

What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?

Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?

You wrote this?

You have faith, Professor Barnhardt

What -- what sort of action do you mean?

It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.

Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?

Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.

Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter

Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?

Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?

He gave these to you?

Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?

Sure. Right near where my mother works.

I thought that was only for bombs.

Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.

I don't believe it.

Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.

We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?

You know about the United Nations?

Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.

We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.

I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.

Oh, Tom, that was awful.

You think it's all right for you to stay here?

How do you know?

I don't know how to thank you.

Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.

Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?

Just twelve.

I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.

"Klaatu barada nikto."

No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.

We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.

How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?

Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.

The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.

Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.

Just passing through Santa Carla?

We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.

All day.

Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!

All together?

They're looking at us.

I can't beat a Triumph.

We were gonna grab some food.

Don't!  Stop!

Where is she?!

With him?

Leave him alone.

What's that smell!?

We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.

David.

Max?  You men we're having company again?

Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?

See you later.

Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.

Tell them to get something to eat.

What's wrong?  Tell me.

Can I sleep in here with you tonight?

Nanook, stop breathin' on me.

Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!

Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.

Ohmygod...

You're cute, Max.

Are you following me?

Hi...

What's your name?

Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?

Ouch.

Now you and David...

They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?

It's gone.  I feel it!

Grandpa does not own a T.V.  Have you noticed?  There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV.  I will not know anything hip happening anymore.

This room is mine.

Where are we going?

You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?

Michael?

What happened, Michael!?

Star.

Who are you calling?

Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.

Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?

What was he doing in the rec room?

Listen to me, Garry.  Please...

Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...

You can't let anybody leave!

Now why'd you go and...

Too damn dangerous.

How you doin', old boy?

Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...

Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...

He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.

I said where?  Where'd you go?!

Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!

Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...

I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.

Torch them!!

What are you doing?

... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...

Maybe we shouldn't.

Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!

My God, what in hell happened here?

Anything?

Well, who's got access to it?

Would that test have worked?

... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.

Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.

Hey, man...!

How long's it been?

Four!

How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.

Somebody definitely messed with it.

We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.

He might just wait us out.

This storm do that?

Get back!!

You jerking off or just pissed?

Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.

We should sleep in shifts.

It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!

No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.

Because you'll never die.

When was his mother taken?

Yes...

Vox?

Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?

Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.

And what of the Eloi?

Why would you let me go back?

That was a foolish thing to do.

I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.

God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?

The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?

You're late.

You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?

... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?

All right, what is it now?

Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.

Darling.

All right...

Let's walk through the park...

Alex, what is it?

You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.

Let them.

... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.

I was not.

Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?

I've been working.

But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --

What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...

I can't do that --

Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.

And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.

Did you hear me, lad?

It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.

That machine --

Is he all right?

You seem fascinated by the stars.

This is magnificent...

... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.

Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.

Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.

Yes.

You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.

Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...

Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.

As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?

Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.

No, sir --

Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.

We have to go after them, find where -- !

What do you mean?!

My fowl have polluted the yard.

How did you get hurt?

I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!

Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --

Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.

I don't give a shit about your patient!

Long live the Organization for the Organized!

Yes.

[Beat] You're his son?

Do I know you from somewhere?

What should they be looking for?

Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.

[Beat] What's your name?

But I like it I guess.

Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.

I gave you my dog tags.

But no one knew until after...

[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?

I didn't kill Officer Harrison.

I don't believe a thing she just said.

I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?

Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her.

What?

Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?

I don't understand.

Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.

And if I didn't want to come?

You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.

How'd he get it?

I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?

What about the world?

[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?

Why not?

I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?

Can I get some paper and something to write with.

William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.

He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.

Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.

What were you talking about the other day?

I know you need one when it's really cold.

[Beat] How do you know?

'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!

Well, how'd you get here?

No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?

I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...

I'm sorry.

Hon.

Do you think you could ever shoot someone?

Why?

Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...

Who's the nut?

Alright!  She did good!  Didn't she?

We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?

Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?

Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.

It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.

Stop.

Oh.  I... where's Louise?

I am the great and powerful Oz...

What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?

You're a bank robber?

You're in Oklahoma?!

Is that how you answer the phone?

You didn't say what it was for, did you?

Are you just doin' this to punish me?

Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?

You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.

Front.

You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.

I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.

So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?

Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.

We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?

Call him?

I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.

How do I look?

What happened to your hair?

Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.

Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!

You think you've found your calling?

Can I ask you kind of a weird question?

What little dogs?

I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.

I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.

Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.

Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!

I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...

I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.

And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.

You do?

Thelma, that is not an option.

And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.

We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.

I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting!

Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?

There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.

What in the hell is that up there?

Isn't it beautiful?!!

We're fine!  How are you?

Oh, Jesus!

Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?

Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.

Gay? He said you were gay?

I don't know about this, Dom.

What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?

Wait a second, I never told you that.

No You mean...?

The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.

How the hell did you get here anyway?

Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.

Bob, do you remember Mary?

He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?

Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?

We're in love with your roommate.

Very nice.

Take it easy, that's Bill.

Hello...? Sully...?  Sully, that you?

Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.

The sawbones?

Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.

How'd you know that?

I work with retards.

You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.

-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --

Fine. Fine.

Lint?

You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...

Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...

Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.

Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.

Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --

Yeah.

No, forget it, it was stupid.

Fuck!!

Turn it up, Magda.

How's my stomach taste, she says.  Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.

Are you okay?

So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.

I don't buy it.

Nope. Never been.

What are you doing?

Hey, hey, hey!

Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.

Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.

Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.

Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?

No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.

Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.

I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!

Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.

Friend. Baseball bat.

That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?

Ho-ly shit.

I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.

Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?

How do you guarantee that?

No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'

You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.

Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.

Good lookin'?

An old flame?

Holy shit...

Pat's an architect, too.

You don't think they're too big?

I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.

What...?

Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.

Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.

Oh yeah. Fine.

Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.

So who you taking to the prom?

I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.

And did everything -- ?

I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.

Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.

I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?

It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.

Why not?

Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.

Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!

See you, Warren.

What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.

We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.

He gets it, but he's pissed.

How does a guy get a rep like that?

I'll do it.

Jesus...

Oh, still sore about this.

My father --

Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.

We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?

Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.

Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --

Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.

Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.

And the second condition?

John. How much time?

Max.

How long until the army is ready?

Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?

-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!

So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?

Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.

When are you going to be home?

Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. He can clear the air on Anglo American relations.

It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?

Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.

There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.

Should be here any minute.

I don't care. Cancel it.

I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.

We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.

I don't want to listen to this again.

Hello?

They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!

We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.

-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --

At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.

Hey.

Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?

Mr. Clear Moon.

Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.

Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?

I know where I am. I'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. It's your call. Who are you?

I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.

Were you in Nam?

Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?

Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?

Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.

I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.

She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.

Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?

This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --

Ray...

-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.

What was he saying?

Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.

So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --

-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.

It's not real.

I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.

Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.

You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.

Cuz I'm a skin?

Not no more.

Still after Jimmy?

Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.

Jesus. Oil?

Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.

I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.

You take care.

He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?

Who did?

Ray. X22.

Do you want a coffee?

Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.

No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?

Washington sent ya. I know that.

I'll bet!

It isn't?

I thought he'd never leave.

Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.

You saw a MiG 21?

The what?

You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?

What would you say, too fast...too quick...

That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.

Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?

Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.

You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.

What if he's not?

How about what?

I'm different.

It dies. We live.

You want to go ballistic?

And now I want you.

You don't believe that.

You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?

Off me or off you?

You weren't gonna say goodbye?

Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.

I live here, remember?

Yes sir. I do, Sir.

One SIXTH the speed of sound!

Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.

Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.

They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!

I'm pulling up.

THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!

Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?

I know!

I've got it -- hold on!

3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!

What do you want?

Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.

So I've heard.

What was that?

Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.

What are you doing?

Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.

What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?

Great move. Great

It's a victory roll.

Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!

Hear about Ice?

ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.

GET LOST!

Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.

You won?!!!

Was going.  Now you are.

That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...

Yes sir..

You're father was Marvin Mitchell..

I wasn't thinking. I just did it.

SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..

Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.

It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.

Skipper, sorry to bother you.

We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.

Or you can quit.

How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.

You think I shouldn't fly.

What's wrong with this one?

What happened to them?

I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...

Need a ride?

Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.

You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.

He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.

Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?

Now let's get down to business.  Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.  And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --Do you think you can play along?

Stop fighting and get out.

Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.

What the fuck is going on here?!  You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?!

Two-headed monsters?

I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.

Blonde, brunette, redhead?

Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.

What do you want?

Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.

Amazing.  Where are we?

I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.

I don't know.

I don't know.  Maybe.

You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.

Are you saying she liked it?

Where is he?

Shit!

I've got a weak signal over there.

He's not at ground level.

Is that better?

Who?

Let's do it.

Doug, maybe we should take a trip.

Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  Okay?

Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?

I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.

The hell you're not.

You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?

Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?

O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?

You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.

I suppose you're not here either.

I love you.

Doug...Bob McClane.

Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...

Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.

Go on.

They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!

Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?

I don't remember you.

Hauser?  You're Hauser.

I thought you didn't like me.

Now what?

The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.

Are you all right?  Are you still you?

Yeah, like they got a plan...

You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.

What the hell you doing back already?

Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.

Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!

BACK OFF, BURT...!

Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.

I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.

You're really leaving, huh?

Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.

Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...

Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.

Fuck you!

It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.

That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.

Well, folks, what's the plan?

Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!

How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?

Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?

<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.

Watch your ass, shithead.

Use the fucking bomb!

<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.

Hi, guys, what you been up to?

I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.

Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?

Darn it!

You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.

What's it doing?

Yeah, they're confused.  They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.

What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!

Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!

I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!

You're fishing. You don't know shit.

Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!

I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi.

Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?

-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?

Look, I'm a lawyer and --

"We"?

Haven't heard that one before, Ed.  But I guess I'll be hearing it again.

How can you remember that?

-- an angel dust dealer --

Where?

Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"?

Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.

I feel like I've been mugged... Guy scared the shit out of me. You made your point, Eddie... I'm relieved we're not taking the case.

-- Easy as that, huh?

That DD-5.

I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!

They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.

Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?

Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?

Stipe was just one of four eyewitnesses who came forward, Kitty. Y'oughta start looking for the others...

I haven't paid you.

You do.

Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...

My mother find you?

What went down?

No.

Quite a bit you didn't tell me.

-- How could I help you?

...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer?  You left your telephone number?

I'd l-like to answer the question.

You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?

My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.

Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?

Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.

You're pissing me off again, Ed.

But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.

I'll prosecute anyone who fucks up. If that makes me look racist, it's a trade-off I'll live with, Ed.

Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?

-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?

Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.

Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?

What do you want?

What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?

Look. Mister --

Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?

"Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.

I think what Eddie wants to say is --

Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?

Tell me some other things about her.

No... No, go away.

SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?

That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.

I'm nearly out.

Thank you, Bobby. A big score?

Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.

No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.

Don't get funny with me again.

Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.

Bobby's got it.

Well, where are you going?

Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.

Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?

You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.

Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.

Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?

OK, Gordon.

Phillip?

That would indicate that it's the future.

Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.

No.

You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.

Lil was wearing a sour face.

I see. He does talk loud.

Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.

There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.

I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?

One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?

Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.

Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?

I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?

Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?

Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.

How did the car get back here?

But I love you, Laura.

You missed somethin', Ed.

Laura, you didn't come and see me today.

Right on time, baby.

It does matter. We're in love.

You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.

What do you mean?

No.

Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.

You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.

I hate asparagus.

Where's Dad?

Good night, Mom.

Dad.

DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.

Leland, what are you doing?

Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.

Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.

I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.

Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?

Abrams. Yes. How are you today?

And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?

I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.

It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...

That was our insurance company's recommendation.

What are you doing here?

...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...

...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...

...he wants to testify...?

You know what that would mean?

You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?

Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.

You would not...?

And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?

Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?

...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is a... why? Why would you do that?

Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?

Orthopedics?

What book is that?

Ed Concannon.

We've touched on this, his own witness has said...

Objection!

No further questions.

You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...

You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?

Anything special about the case?

Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.

...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.

I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...

I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.

I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...

...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...

I didn't do too well for you.

I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.

Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...

I am on the staff of...

And you wrote that...

...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?

Uh... in the, well, in the interests of her family... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution. Her doctors...

I'm sorry...?

Do you know who her doctors were?

One hour.

I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?

A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?

Maybe I can do something right.

Why don't you get some rest?

You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...

Not if you don't grow up...

What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...

Joe...  Joe...

You're pressuring yourself...

Thank you.

I can't guarantee that...

Pardon?

Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...

You know what happened.

You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...

It's not a good case. It's a very good case.

...we, we love her, Dick and me...

We just can't do it anymore.  This is our chance to get away.

Dr. Gruber.

...hey, I don't need your charity...

I have to talk to you.

Are you out of your mind...?

To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...

You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'

Who have we got?

Right.

So what?

Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.

She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'

Dr. Towler...

You have a record of what happened in the operating room...

But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...

Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...

Yes.

Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?

Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.

Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...

There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.

What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?

The troops are certainly moving in here!

Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.

Is that... machine...?

Where are we?

I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.

A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.

What was it like?

They've blocked it!

Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?

I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...

Gratzman! -- Gratzman!  Did you get those biotics?

We will, sir!

What'll we say to 'em?

I thought you'd killed Freddy off.

I thought he'd stopped doing horror.

Can I read it?

You mean that was a...

I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?

Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.

One of mom's cups got broken.

Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.

It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.

Guess so.

Heather?

He's had some sort of...episode.

Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?

If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?

These look quite fresh.

He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.

What?

Rex saved me.

"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."

Who?

Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.

Mommy's fine, Dylan.  Just had a bad dream.  What're you doing out of bed?

Home.

Hurry back, please.  I'm sleepy.

Heather?  You doing okay?

Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.

What...happened?

You didn't jump in.

Seemed, not was.

I've never mentioned it to him.

A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.

I want to see the body.

No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?

This is still a script we're talking about, right?

Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?

You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?

Isn't there anyone that can stop him?

Me?  Why me?

The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.

Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?

Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.

Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.

She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."

Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!

Well, that's all part of it.

But your instinct was to lose sail?

Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.

I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.

Where you going?

They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.

Bregitta.  Do you believe it?

Feels different doesn't it?

Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.

It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.

God damn it man.  I think he broke my nose!

You weren't there, you don't know what happened.

But that's not the point...

Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?

Jesus.

Good.

I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?

You think Skipper and Alice do it?

Where are you from any way?

That's how he died you know.

Can't do it.

The Dolphin was a symptom.

But you invited is aboard.

Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.

And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.

We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.

What is it we can do for you today?

What's wrong, you don't like steak?

Because I felt like it.  What do you care?

Don't ever call me stupid.

I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.

Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.

They tell you that?

I don't.

That's not a satisfactory answer.

Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.

Tie it off!!

You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!

They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.

Phil.  What are you doing?

Swing up, son.

You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!

I can't be sure.

I can dig this music... But not that singer.

Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.

Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.

I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.

What's Cao Ben?

Whisper it... Whisper "fuck me"... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper...

Thought you said this was a private club. How come I'm allowed in without bein' a member?

No.

They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?

Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.

I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.

Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?

Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?

Mostly black though in that boogie place.

But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?

Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.

If your neighbors didn't mind, how'd you get put out of business?

What happened on the charges?

The Good Witch...

Only that it's supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.

I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there'd be trouble. He's just got some kind of influence over her I can't decipher. There's somethin' wild in Lula I don't know where it comes from. You gotta find 'em, Johnnie.

I got some news, Marietta. Lula and Sailor been here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday.

Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.

Who was that?... Who know's your here?

Don't give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain't the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.

Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.

Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?

Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.

What brand'd she smoke?

You're perfect for me, too.

That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.

You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?

Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.

He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.

Sailor?

Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?

I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.

Actin' funny how?

The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.

He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.

I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.

You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.

Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.

What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.

What's that, honey?

We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.

My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?

Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...

Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.

What was this one?

Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.

I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?

More'n likely.

You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?

What's that, peanut?

You're scarin' me, baby.

God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.

They have, sugar.

Let's get ahold a' her quick.

Now what?

I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired.

That you, Sail, honey?

It's okay by me, peanut.

Yeah... He was lookin' for you.

Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.

He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.

Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?

I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.

Really, Sail, I'll be okay.

...live in exchange for sexual favors. Police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls, all Asians twelve to fifteen years old, who have been living in the North Houston warehouse with a Vietnamese pimp since February. The girls are being treated as victims, said police Sergeant Amos Milburn. 'These are really just children,' he said, 'but they've been exposed to a lot already.

Mama???

I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.

I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.

Course I am, mama.

Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.

Really, mama, I gotta go.

I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.

Oh God! What does that mean?

Take care of him?

Shoot him? Like with a gun?

Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?

You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.

You got nice tits.

I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didn't you?... I can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There's no turning back. I'm in a killing mood.

Where we goin'?

No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...

So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.

Oh, don't worry 'bout that...

Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.

No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.

Thank you.

I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor...

Emily?

Mm.

I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.

You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??

No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?

That was good.

What's this guy's problem?

You stay there.

How bad is it for you?

Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.

Me? What can I do?

How are you -- is it Joe?

Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?

Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.

Who's got a gun?

Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.

Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?

So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.

So what are you doing out here?

Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...

Go ahead.

That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.

Mmhmmm... knap... sap...

Oh.

Afraid so.

I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.

How's that?

I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.

A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.

I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.

She seemed to take it pretty well.

Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.

Carvel.

It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.

Whatever kind they wanted her to be.

This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?

The one that left you?

Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers.

That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.

It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --

That's why you're having them. Your spells.

I'm not going, with them.

Me? Sure. Why?

So what are you going to do?

That strikes me as odd.

All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.

The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?

But where? I need the street.

It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.

I got the message you called.

I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.

You go first.

So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.

Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?

No, really, Sara, I don't think you --

Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.

Who's gun is that?

You heard? How?

Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.

Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?

Sara.

And what do you think you might have said?

Did you just make that up?

Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?

Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.

Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.

Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.

Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.

She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.

Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.

Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.

Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.

Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...

Don't need to think fast to handle beer.

Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.

I'll never forget you got me started there.

Hey, is that a school?

Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.

Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?

It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.

Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs?

What's happening?

I've got some good news.

Soon.

You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.

What are you looking at?

There's a million birds here.

It's just a city park.

Try.

Something like that.

Don't you have friends?

What's up?

Too much sun.

Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.

You knew her?

You don't know?

He I.D.'d the assailant. The description matches you pretty well.

I'd keep away from him.

People have the right to know.

No thank you.

What's her name?

How do you know?

Walter?

No.

It's getting dark. Go home.

You seem a little hostile today.

It's very good, indeed.

Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?

What are you afraid will happen?

Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?

Will I ever be normal?

Do you know what "normal" is?

Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?

You don't know!

Close your eyes.

No, I am not going to --

No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?

Where?

Don't ever do that again.

Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?

You felt pleasure.

She's still really hurt... and angry. I don't know... if she will ever... forgive me. I understand that. I do. I just hope... I just want her to...

What?

What's weird about that?

You're quiet at work.

You don't hang out with the other guys.

You never spoke to me before.

I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.

So... what's your dark secret?

No you're not.

So, what did you do?

Sorry.

My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.

You really believe that?

For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.

I love my brothers.

Neither am I.

It's a bad idea.

I don't even know how to live with myself.

I've got problems.

What's this?

I don't need a plant.

What's going on?

This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.

Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were--

She-hit.

Nice shot, Lins.

Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.

I'm taking you back out.

Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?

I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?

We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!

You never did like being called that, did you?

I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.

So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?

What happened?

I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.

Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women nervous.

The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.

It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.

Try again.

I don't know how!

Alright, put this on.

Don't argue, goddamnit, just--

Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...

Oh God, Lins... I--

Did you find Wilhite?

Come on, man.  What else could it be?

Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?

Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...

'Fish'?

Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.

That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.

Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.

Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?

Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...

Hey!

Getting a reading?

He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us.

What kind of light?

Would we see the flash?

You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.

Did you sleep well?

And have you any other truths to tell me?

Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.

This looks to me like a good sign. Don't you think so? As far as I'm concerned, anyone who reads the Bible could not have committed an act of impropriety. Why... as a matter of fact, I remember when I was in China, many years ago, I happened to be involved in a similar situation, concerning an English woman, the wife of Ambassador Shafford, a good friend of mine. There, too, we found a Bible... And I said at the time that whatever had happened, that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of... suicide. Why, it was logical, I said, that whoever reads the Bible believes in God and therefore...  No? You don't believe it? Well, as a matter of fact, I was right... The woman was found two days later. It was a case of amnesia.

It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.

I think you're very sweet, Corrado.

Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?

I have a feeling that you're not used to being alone.

Don't be so humble.

Shall we go for a swim?

As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.

Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.

Are you feeling better?

And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.

But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.

What is it, Claudia?

Does it please you to say such things?

Then why do you say them?

Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.

Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?

No, Sandro... Please...

Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...

Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.

He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?

I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.

But where did you finally end up?

Do you consider that a compliment?

Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?

Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get back into bed.

Please, you come too...

They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.

Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?

I'll stay here also.

Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying...

And what are we going to do now?

You men are all so dreadful!

Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.

Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one.

Don't worry, we've got everything.

Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...

Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?

We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.

Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.

Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.

No.

Yes.

No he doesn't. He hates fat people.

It's a sin to be fat.

Look at the statues, they're thin.

No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.

Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.

I'm being punished.

Why?

What do you mean?

For what?

Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?

I fell asleep.

Yes.

From God.

What's your real name?

Are you married?

You liked Sister Paul?

You have trouble sleeping?

What things?

I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?

Why not?

If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?

... that you don't remember getting pregnant...

But you're troubled... aren't you?

What did you do?

She can't hurt you any more.

Why?

Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.

Are you pretty?

Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.

I really love you.

Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?

Of telling you.

No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?

Would you like to tell me?

Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.

Hm hmm.

My bed.

No.

I feel as if I've eaten glass.

Which one?

Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two three...  It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel?

Agnes, can you hear me?

Him.

She'd seen him too.

Stay away from me...

I hate him.

You saw it all didn't you?

What did you do?

I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.

???

Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.

The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.

Something they... that they overlooked.

Larry...

Thanks. 

Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.

How did she hide it from the other nuns?

Who was the father?

What man had access to her?

Was there a priest?

Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.

Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.

Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.

You don't really believe something like that happened do you?

Shortly after she came to us.

Nuns... you hate nuns.

???  

I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 

How?

The sheets...

When was that?

There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.

Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.

Why didn't you do anything to stop her?

And my permission?

We'll see about that.

I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.

Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...

Even Christ would partake socially.

Mary Magdelen?

I'd like to begin.

There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.

Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.

This is permission to take her apart.

Who knew she was pregnant?

And you didn't send her to a doctor.

Too late for what?

The usual ten per cent?

Lay them down.

Lay them down.

They're yours.

Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.

I bet you're  -- sixteen!

No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.

Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.

What about all these letters?

Can you fix him for me?

All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.

Sure.

That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?

I see you go to the night court.

Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?

Grotty?

Did you look in here?

Oh!

Oh, it's the way you talk.

I see.  Do you like the play?

Thank you.

Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!

Pity.

Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!

At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!

You're only right.

Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?

And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.

You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.

I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.

You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.

Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?

Yeah ... so what?

Well, don't be daft, I've got to.

Anything to spare?

Well, what are we waiting for?

Well we know that but what's he doing here?

Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?

Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.

Let's go and muck in.

You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?

Y'what?

If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.

Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.

Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.

Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.

They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.

John, I'm talking to you. This final run through is <U>important</U>. Understand? Important.

You are.

Temper! Temper!

Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.

Eh, where's my grandfather?

I've got the stuff. Come here.

He belongs to Paul.

None for me, then?

What do you think are you're up to?

Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.

Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.

I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.

Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?

What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.

Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.

Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?

I'll set John on you!

What is he?

Locked.

Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.

There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.

Do you remember the pyramid?

Any rotation?

Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.

It's... basalt.  Rock.

What is it?

I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?

What's wrong?

A transmission?

Yes!

How long to fix?

Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?

Yes?  What is it?

Why, what's wrong?

What the hell's going on?

Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid?

He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.

We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.

It makes me sick to see him like that.

Yes.

Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.

We can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit!  It'll flood the whole ship!

We've got six hours left.

Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!

<u>How</u>?

Look at that.

This is horrible.

If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.

Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?

Receiving.

There, it caught!

No, it's coming.

It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.

We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.

And what do we do when we find it?

I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.

They're getting pretty close now.

My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!

It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...

These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?

Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.

10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.

Zero.  Dry as a bone.

Find anything we missed?

This ship is full of cat hair.

Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --

You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.

Engaged.

We made it!  Damn, we made it!

Which presumably means...

Poor kitty; puss puss puss.

<u>Hey watch it</u>!

And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --

Headache?  Dehydration?

Can I... um... have some water?  Please?

Yeah, it's fine.

Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?

Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?

MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.

I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?

It's too late!

Not yet.

Hey, Guttierez?

Whoa, wait a minute...

But I'm going first...

Hold it, hold it...

Oh, man.  That's no glitch!

Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.

Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.

Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.

They knocked out the external feeds.

Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.

Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.

I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.

Any luck raising Ackland's party?

Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.

So, what do you think?

Hurry it up.

Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.

Hello, there. Who are you?

You're more than modest.

I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...

Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-

San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?

And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?

A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?

I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...

Just like it.

It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...

Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?

So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all...

Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-

Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?

Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.

I can't believe my ears...

You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it!

Then say so.

I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...

No, it's not.  It's for this.

Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.

It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-

I was there. An eyewitness.

You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.

Just slipped your mind.

Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...

Good luck, genius...

Macbeth.

Hi.  My wonderful junk yard. The mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard-

Can't keep his eyes off my legs.

Bill...

Knit me a muffler.

What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-

You're my girl, aren't you?

Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?

She did...?

It's a good thought.

Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?

I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.

I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...

No heart to burn.

The kid. Junior.

Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...

I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.

The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!

Don't be condescending.

The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.

I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...

A cowboy.

The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.

Every day.

- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.

When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-

- and for you.

She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...

How do you do, my dear.

I'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, Birdie dear.

I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-

There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?

The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.

Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!

About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?

That's the door.

To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...

You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?

Hello, Miss Channing.

Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up...  ... whose is it?

Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...

There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-

Mrs. Richards.

No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...

Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it?

The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.

May I have your coat?

Oh, but there is-

Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?

She knows enough not to be here.

Hello, Miss Harrington.

Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?

That's my job.  See you at tea time...

If you'd like.

Good evening, Mr. deWitt.

She's just outside the door.

Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...

Margo, really...

How far to the station?

He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-

I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.

Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.

So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...

I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?

Margo.  Margo, I want you to know how sorry I am about this...

"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"

How was the concert?

- 'at's my loyal little woman.

Lloyd, what happened...?

Margo, again...

- don't run out of adjectives, dear.

It's going to be a cozy weekend.

We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...

Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!

All this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named deWitt! She apologized, didn't she?

That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!

Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.

Well of all-

You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?

Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?

Don't be evasive.

Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.

Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...

To you, too?

You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...

I never said it was!

Yes, sir.

Call, what call?

That's right, but I don't understand-

"Liebestraum."

Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.

Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?

She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-

Promise.

This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!

--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--

--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--

All right, what do we know?

--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.

And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.

What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?

--what do you think?--

Maybe a political operative of some sort--

What's that?

See her?  Get anything?

I hate both parties.

'68.

Think Sloan's back?  What's wrong?

--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.

--I want you to shut up and listen to me--

Nah.  Maybe.

What's the matter?

I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.

How many fucking sources they think we got?--

Woodward?

What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?

--jeeeeeeesus--

--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.

The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--

I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.

According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.

Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?

None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.

Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--

Speak.

You've really got to go.

We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.

It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--

Who by?

But they both worked at the White House?

Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?

I really can't talk now--

--I'm not your source on that--

--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--

What's this?

I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story.  I don't think we should cover the story, period.

--I saw him. He verifies.

They are not my clients.

You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?

She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?

Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--

The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--

--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.

What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.

What?

Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.

Talk about Segretti--

--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--

And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?

Where?

I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--

We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?

--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--

Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?

...go on, go on...

Who's Charles Colson?

The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel.

--has any of them got an ax?--

Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?

I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.

And as treasurer, you could release those funds?

Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!

Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.

Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.

Good morning gentleman.

I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!

All right, I got some scotch.

Of course, Finch.  What?

What are we gonna hear?

What do you suppose they're saying?

Just go!

You're gonna shit your pants!

Oh sure.  I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not <u>all</u> that I am.

Hey, what're you doing here?

Do I have to?

What?!

Hi...

Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.

This isn't any better, Chris.

What?  We both have cars.

Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.

I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.

Thanks.  It was my idea.

Give it to me!  Yes!

Fuck me!  Yes!

You think she was serious?

Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.

Did I miss anything?!

Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.

Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?

What the heck is this?

Thank you, dad, I got it.

Dad.

Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.

Yeah, bring it on!

This'll do.

Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.

Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.

You did it.

So you need to change, right?

James!  You have come in here on purpose?!

Uh...

Stifler, you're such an asshole.

It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.

Oh, Kev.

Vicky, wait.

And I want to try to make it up to you.

Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.

Hey...

Now?!

Okay.  Did you bring a condom?

That was a great night.

Have you ever heard of the bible?

Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.

Hey.  I got another question for you.

You ever hear of something called The Bible?

The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!

So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.

Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?

Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?

<u>Yeah</u>!

I don't know if I want to be doing this.

Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you.

Merde! Just missed!

Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...

Ha-ha!

Like an underground club?

Andy! Holy shit!

Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...

I don't... I... I can't remember...

Because, Andy. It's a cure.

I hope they fucking fry us all.

No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.

God. I can't believe it.

What does it say?

Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.

Hey! You shouldn't be down there!

Okay, what the hell are you up to?

Pull over! Now!

Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?

Before the coma!

Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM!  Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!

No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!

Don't be an idiot! I'm not the only one. If I die, Serafine dies!

Claude...?

We know you were with her.

What?

"Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed."  These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper.

Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?

Because Gaston was after it.

Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...

Uncle Terrence?

Not that I know.

Alright. Let me write a letter.

Shit. I feel sick.

Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?

Andy, stop! I think he can help you - 

I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.

Twelve thirty-six a.m. here. Twelve forty a.m. here. There's two of them. At least.

You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?

Why were you so late tonight

Hurry, Grandmama!

I have to go now, before it gets light.

Is everyone all right?

I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .

Why do you want to go to Paris?

Come on up!

Every Russian family has one..

Nervous?

I'm so scared...

Dmitri?

Do you remember this?

Why does everyone have to act that way?

And this is my future. This is who I am!

Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!

I'm getting a chest cold..

Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?

Wake up, young lady, that's our train.

You're a princess...

How is our current financial status?

I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...

I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay

You are the boy ...

Singer!

Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.

You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?

What do you mean, next?

Yes.

H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!

Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?

Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?

I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.  Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?

In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.

I know- because of our sexual problem, right?

Don't give it to me. Don't!

Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.

It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!

Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.

For yuh.

Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...

Your grammy!

Well... thank you again.

Sylvia Plath.

Well, who's Sadie?

Me? Oh, uh.  No.

Yeah.

No, I'm gonna quit!

My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.

Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.

Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-

I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.

Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?

You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited.

I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...

Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.

Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?

Oh, you have my body.

Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.

You're so sure about it.

"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."

And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.

She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.

David! David! I can't believe this!

Oooh.

Yeah, where is the spider?

Yeah, but it's real close.

Remember, we had that thing.

Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.

You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.

Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.

...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.

Christ!

I'm into garbage. It's my thing.

You look very pretty.

You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.

So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?

No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.

What'd I do?

Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!

Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.

Here you are. There's people out there.

Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?

Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?

Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-

Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.

What-

I can think of another word.

I mean that as a compliment.

Oh.

This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?

Charlie Chaplin.

Sixteen years ago.

I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."

Stop calling me Max.

Ah.

No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.

Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.

What's the matter?

You wanna lie down?

Oh, he-he didn't say anything.

Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?

Max, are we driving through plutonium?

Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.

I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.

If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.

Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.

Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.

Yeah.

Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.

There were many men interested in you?

So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?

Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?

You're not upset that I brought the dog?

Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?

Had a little help?

Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?

The movie.

She already has.

What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.

Oh.

What is that thing?

Would you leave us alone right now?

Is he not going?  I booked a flight.

Can I open it?

So?

Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.

We've heard lots about you.

There's a test, you know.

Oh yeah?

Hey.  Thanks, buddy.

I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.

He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.

Kiss the back of my knees.

Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.

Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.

Yes.

Two minutes.

Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.

What are you saying?

You think this was to hurt you?!  My God, Joe.  It isn't about you.

I'm a monster.  Exactly.

I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.

No.

Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?

I know.  It's for the baby's crib.

Coffee?

Oh.  Well.  Good.

The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.

It's a novel.

Do I put you off?

And I you.

Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.

Please, Ryan.

Something soft.

Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.

I'm a little nervous, so...

I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.

But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...

Oh shit.  I'm sorry.

Are you okay?

Medallions.

Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.

I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?

Of course it's alright.

What?

I didn't say a word.

I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?

I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.

I don't need a drug.

Hi.  Monica and Ryan?

I...

Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?

Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.

Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?

Are you lovesick?

How?

Everyday.

Shit.  It's my Galiano.

So how are you really doing, Panes?

No.  Really.  For real.  Really.

You're a shit.

How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?

Well, something's wrong.

Thank you, Panes.

I didn't know you had this.

Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.

Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?

In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.

Well good.  Thank God.

What do you mean, thank God?

Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?

I don't have a drug problem.

Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!

You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!

Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.

No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.

That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --

I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.

Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?

I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.

Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!

This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!

So what makes you so special?

Come on, Z.

Z!  what are you doing?

I mean, I've got the whole package, right?  A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.

Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.

Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.

Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!

Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!

Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!

General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?

Yes, what else?

Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.

Hey, did you hear what he said?!

Ma'am?

You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?

What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?

Oh, I never catch colds.

I hope everything goes all right.

No.

I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.

This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?

Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?

Your phone.

I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --

I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?

You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.

Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?

You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?

Who?

Oh, you're wrong. He told me --

She doesn't seem to like you very much.

Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?

I think I'm going to give it all up.

I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?

You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.

Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.

There's a call for you --

You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.

Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.

You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.

Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?

Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?

Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.

I guess so.

Mind if I come in?

Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.

I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.

Baxter?

Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?

You do?

I am?

Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?

I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?

Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?

You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.

Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --

I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.

No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --

For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --

Sir?

You left your wife?

That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom --  Say, what happened to you, Baxter?

Especially not Miss Kubelik.

Now you're being bright?

Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.

What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?

That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.

I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.

Hi, Baxter.

Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.

Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.

Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.

I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --

I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --

Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.

As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.

What's her name?

How do you spell her last name?

Why do you want to know, Doc? You don't have to report this, do you?

Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --

Sorry to lose you, Baxter.

That so.

'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?

Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?

Say, this is Snugsville.

Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.

Good night?

Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.

That guy really must've belted him.

Dreyfuss.

No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?

You're not being funny.

I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --

Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --

Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --

How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.

A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --

Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.

Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.

I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.

I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.

That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?

Where do you live?

Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.

Did you have a nice Christmas?

Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.

But I thought you could hold your tongue.

Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.

Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?

What !

Winning the war by yourself.

I was an FO for the 25th.

Yeah.

Sometimes.

How long were you up there ?

Chef.

Why they call you that?

Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?

A sauciere --

Who's he?

Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time.

Can I go get those mangos now?

What'd he say?

Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?

They're not Cong.

Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.

I never heard about that.

They nail him for it bad ?

Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.

Terminate ?

Do me a favor buddy, please.

You got a chance in that boat -- by morning you could be five miles down the river.

How did they know?

Yeah.

I thought he was a lame.

Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.

Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.

I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?

You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?

You smell that.  You smell that?

What do you mean?

How big it is?

This is Baker Delta Four -- Captain hit bad -- need dust-off. Receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about thirty yards to our left.

What'd you do for supplies?

Can you trust them?

And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?

You were not coming here, to see me?

Do you know me?

Do you?

Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.

How's yours?

Gimme water.

Go away -- hide yourself.

Did you know him very well?

Were you with him, when...

Captain Willard?

You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.

This boat's a mess.

Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.

Cognac?

What's a big question?

Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.

So that's it.

This -- Bob Hope or the like --

That's 27, sir.

Where's your chief supply officer?

What?

Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live.  You're the first people we've seen in two weeks.

See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.

Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you.  That's what you want out of this, isn't it?

48   CONTINUED:

Let's go.

Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.

A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-

How did she..?

What happened here?

Stay here.

I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.

That's not what I meant.

Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.

Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.

You're hurt.

Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.

Leave it here.

Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.

Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.

Been driving long?

Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?

Have to backtrack, find another way down.

Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.

Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?

Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.

Answer and I'll shoot!

Can you walk?

You better get some sleep.

Mr. Desmond!  Arthur Neff.  Area rep for the Federal Assistance Plan.  Tell the boys in DC to keep those goodies coming.

Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.

This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.

Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --

I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!

Meaning he'll need a plane.

This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.

You're not still writing that thank-you note?

Do you love me?

Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?

Have they done blood tests on him?

Me. My home number is on this card.

I'm starving.

I know. He's just the best.

Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.

You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.

Getting loud, getting loud.

The stiff one eye?

Funny, I thought it was a strong point.

Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.

Hi.

I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.

... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.

That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.

No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.

No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.

You don't owe me that.

Sex with Simon?

Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.

I'll take you... why not?

I wasn't asleep!!

It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.

No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.

Do you want to know what happened with my parents?

Well...

I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?

How to die, mostly.

We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.

So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?

No touch. No touch. No touch.

Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.

How's Verdell doing?

No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.

I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.

Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.

Good evening.

The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.

Sure thing.

Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?

No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...

That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...

If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.

Please, just leave.

Not it at all, really.

Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...

What are you talking about? You got real problems.

Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.

I told you to go on in.

I think you gotta camp it here...

You going to come talk to me or not?

Because...  ... you love her?

Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."

Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.

How do you write women so well?

Where you from?

What are you doing?

You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing?

So what happens now?

No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!

Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?

They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.

What?

Who?

I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.

Is this how it went, Nick?

A player?

An assassin?

Someone hired both of you?

Why?

Forget it!

I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.

Electra.

Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.

Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.

They recruited me when I was in high school.

Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.

I was just different.

But you've never figured out a way to win.

I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.

Breakfast.

You should knock.

Two way?

He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.

Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.

I don't believe that.

When I first saw them I thought they were married.

Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?

I know.  It makes me crazy.

I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.

Yes.

Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?

Uh-huh.

Was nice.

He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!

I thought it was interesting --

That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.

But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?

Do you ever think about starting over?

Is that all you want?

Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.

I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.

'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.

Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.

Why didn't you fade?

Yeah.

This will take some time.

Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?

Of course, senor.

Cheers Katka!

I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.

Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.

You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?

No, but like my dad said, "There's only so many ways you can wire a plug".

No, he was talking about girls, I think.

Yep, except a name for this place.

Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?

It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?

Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka?

Need any disks?

Moved on to plumbing huh?

I thought you were gonna throw these?

We're going to need it all.

Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.

No, not if you've got better things to do.

Like a hand?

Here, let's both put in two hundred crowns. That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.

You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.

I see, you've got your hands too far up your collective arse to pull it out long enough except to drink my bloody wine.

And a tram hit you?

You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?

Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?

I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.

It was all in Czech wasn't it.

Doug, I can't just leave you!

If I cut a deal, I'm not staying in this country and I want Holly to come with me. So, if she doesn't come here today, you're going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after I call, promise?

What about me?

It was a condition of getting Doug out.

You're sure?

There shooting at something.

Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?

Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.

Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?

Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.

I'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here....A weekly thing.

I could pencil you in if you like?

A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?

I don't want to get in trouble.

It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.

Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while.

Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.

I hope you're going to invite me in?

Forget about me Kat.

It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.

Hi, want to take up dancing?

Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.

Sure, they are students.

There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.

I'll do my best. Is the place open.

Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.

It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?

Yes, of course...maybe one hour.

Will they free me?

Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.

It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.

Did you take your things over to my place?

And you broke into that room?

What was the real purpose behind this venture?

Really!

You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.

How do I know this isn't a trap?

No, just a drill.

So, he didn't fire you?

All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.

Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?

I think we should be going honey.

That's my bag.

You are responsible...What has happened?

What are you an idiot!

It was crazy not to have destroyed them

Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --

What if they expel you?

I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.

To see your father?

Were you with Jamie?

That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.

And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.

You.

You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.

'I hope your dreams come true.'

'Is it really me?'

This play -- ?

I know you don't want help.

I'll get something for us to drink --

Yeah.

No.

You have to believe to have faith.

He doesn't trust you.

Oh. Just not at school...

So it's like you want to be secret friends.

I haven't been nice to you.

Maybe you inspire me.

Like fire.

Your turn.

It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.

Assholes. This happen to you?

From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat.  On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.

Are you trying to seduce me?

What's the best thing I can see tonight?

I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --

Nope.

What are you thinking?

I've talked to your father.

Will you do something for me?

By accident --

I'm supposed to always be alone?

Boys like him have -- expectations.

Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --

Materially or spiritually?

I thought she built it herself.

You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --

Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?

Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.

Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --

I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?

How was school today?

How old are you?

It's polyester.

You remember me...?

He comes out of the cafeteria line, he's nervous, he spills his corn, and he asks you to the dance!

Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.

I'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. It's funny, but somehow, I feel like....like I know you.

I think I know exactly what you mean.

By the way, that reminds me...  Saturday night we're taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food.

George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?

'Bike fine point?'

And where am I gonna be?

You mean, you're gonna --

Maybe if I used my left....

Yeah, explode it up your ass!

You have a name?

Sir, it only costs a nickel.

Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.

March 11th.

Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.

Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!

Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.

A time machine! Because of that Coke?!

Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!

Of course. Shemp is unaware that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over. We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp the trip was instantaneous.

Marty, that would alter history.

He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.

Pardon me?

Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.

Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?

I don't recall ever seeing it before.

That's all taken care of.

That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?

But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?

Gone?... Where?

No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.

Where'd you get them antlers?

Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.

Does he bite?

You ever held another job before?

We did it, Ray.

You like people?

Holly's over here, Kit, if you want to see her.

What for?

Okay.

You still in school?

Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.

Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.

You're a redhead.

Can I come around and see you tomorrow?

And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.

You know what I think?

Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.

Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?

How you doing?

I found a lid. It was laying on the ground over there.

Is he upset?

No.

Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?

What?

Course it's too bad about your dad.

Hi.

Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?

Hi, whatcha doing?

Fine.

Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.

See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...

Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!

Planet 10?

Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.

Apache?

Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?

Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?

Running a little late, Buckaroo.

It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.

Buckaroo--! Sorry--

What is this thing?  A fighter?

And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.

...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...

Got a casualty list?

Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?

Go away.  Let me rot?

Was she pretty?

Oh, my.

I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.

A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.

But John Whorfin said kill her.

Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?

That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.

I am sorry, it's so embarassing.

...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!

...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.

If you could, I'd 

Barton, honestly, only the last couple-

...This'll sometimes help.

Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-

I write.

Well that's what he said.

...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?

...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man  to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.

I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.

I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.

I'm sorry, I just feel like I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-

I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the 

I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.

Don't worry about it. It's just a B picture. I bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. Life is too short.

Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!

I didn't say anything-

I can't write anything by tomorrow.

What do you mean, Barton?

...Is the egg showing or what?!

Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and  and  and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?

Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.

My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.

...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration 

I hope these are your shoes.

Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...

...I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you.

Hold on 

Jesus... They can tell that...

Jesus, Charlie, I...

It's okay... It's okay...

You'll be back?

To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik 

...Yes, thank you.

Fink.

...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.

Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.

Yes sir.

...Are you a tranz or a rez?

Transient or resident?

Is this multiple choice?

Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.

Good luck with no fuckin' head.

Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.

Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.

Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.

Why's it so goddamn hot out here?

We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was a killing.  A professor. Icepick.  In his bed.  Multiple stab wounds.  1977.

How is your -- personal life?

How about the booze?

What are you doing here?

How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?

What is this interest you've got in her?

Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?

Yes, you do.

I thought you were out of cigarettes.

You like playing games, don't you?

Even though you were fucking him.

If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.

What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?

I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.

I like you.

Ice?

What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?

Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.

When did you write it?

How's your new book?

Did you think it was so special?

What did you think?

How's your shoulder?

No.

About three months before I met you.

I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.

You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.

You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.

No.

Why not?

What do we do now, Nick?

There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.

Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?

How did he die?

In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me.

Who was this fuckin' guy?

I never heard of him.

Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.

What you doin', son?

Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?

I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!

I'm not afraid of her.

Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.

So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?

Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.

I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.

Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.

She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.

We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.

Hey  it's the big A.M..

It's in New York.

Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.

I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.

Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.

That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.

What's with the wigs?

That was my favorite part!

I'm interested in showing Jean's work.

When?

Tom and Cynthia Kruger.

Who did this?  Who did this?

Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.

Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.

Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?

Not what?

I see..  And... How do you respond to being called  hmmm...   yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."

Why, that's from Time Magazine.

Would you like to see the wine list?

Paint it out.

You got a date already?

Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.

Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.

Wanna go get some breakfast?

... I'll buy you some new ones.

You're back.

Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee 

What's wrong with me?

Is that the best quality you have?

I really... admire you.

You're a fast mover.

That's a beautiful name. French?

What? Wait a minute... talk to me.

Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?

You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?

So shut up and keep painting..

You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother  when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.

Hey, Rene.

You don't have any!!!

Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.

YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.

Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT.

Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.

As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you?

You're not the Mayor.

I'm listed.

... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?

Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?

It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.

Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --

There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...

Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...

A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...

... What do we do?

Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.

I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.

I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?

You buy this "blurry" business?

Yawn.  That coulda come from anywhere.

Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.

Max!  Relax!  Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this.  We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--

I don't.  So, no.

Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?

And a very, very good one.

Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.

Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -

You certainly will not.

I'm sorry.  I was too late.

Uncle Alfred?

Is there something wrong, sir?

But I can't can I?

Women.

Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...

Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?

Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.

After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.

You're loosing your cool

... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...

Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.

She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...

I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.

Umm-hmmmm.

She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.

We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.

Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.

Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.

Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.

You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.

You will rescue my wife

Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.

What say we turn up the heat?

How about dangerous curves?

Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.

You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.

Join you?  I've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination. When I get through you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry, do you hear me, you psycho?

...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?

It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.

I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.

How are you feeling, young man?

...Afraid.

...A bat.

Master, Bruce?

All the answers are numbers.

Up here, Al.

_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?

Now black rubber.

Help Chase. I'll be back.

Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?

We'll talk some other -

What? Oh, it's very impressive.

La'chiem.

Rinka.

The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?

Still play with dolls, Doctor?

To kill me.

Look, I'd love to keep chatting-

Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.

Fast work. You just moved here.

Find anything interesting?

Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.

My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling...

I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.

Okay. I'm outta here.

Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.

Chase?

Edward...

Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.

Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.

Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.

You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.

What about the girl?

How much do you weigh?

All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.

... How long have I been out?

To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.

I know it's late. I -- Are you there?

I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.

Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.

"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."

All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.

Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.

SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!

I'm on top of it.  If there's a problem --

Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.

Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."

Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?

It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.

You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!

How'd you know it was me?

Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.

No.

Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.

Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.

Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon

You are on drugs.

He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.

Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!

LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!

HOLY SHIT!!

Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!

Yeeees?

David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?

It's the last thing we need.

I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.

Hi,

Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.

Sort of half.....

I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.

Here, let me do that.

Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.

Goodnight Annie.

Howls he getting on with the family?

It's great when people who work together can become real friends.

Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy.

We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor.

Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!

Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?

Welsh.

Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.

But is she gonna be okay?

We need you urgently in C Theatre.

what a pleasure, Governor.  Welcome.

Interesting suit.

off the peg?

Shut up, Kevin.

You know the thing I hate most about children?

Huh huh huh. That was cool.

Huh huh huh. He said "anus."

Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.

Huh huh. This says Beavis.

Ow! These chips suck.

Huh huh huh huh huh huh.

Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?

Me first.

Check it out Butt-Head, TV!

Check it out Butt-Head, porta-potties.

Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?

Whoa, my life is cool!

Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.

Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt cheeks, huh huh huh.

Yeah, heh heh. Umm, isn't Seattle in Washington? Heh heh... 'cuz I was thinking maybe we could go see Hole.

Huh huh huh. Settle down Beavis.

Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.

Bunghole...

Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...

Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.

Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!

Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?

Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!

Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!

Uh, we didn't score yet.

You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?

Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?

Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!

Chief, look!

Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.

She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.

One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?

She sure does.

Cool. Huh huh huh.

You'll be rich!

I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.

There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?

Cabin fever, hon?

Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.

Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?

We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.

That little girl saw us.

Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.

We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.

Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?

What happened?

She's only fourteen...

Honey.  Let's go.

We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.

What time is it?

<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?

We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...

You don't have an appointment, do you?

Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.

<u>Barbara</u>?!!

Handbook?  When...?

If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...

Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!

Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.

Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'

Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.

You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.

No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.

I feel like we've been at war, Charles.

Where is your mother?

What?

Look at all that <u>parking</u>!

Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...

Are they suffering?

We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.

<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.

I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --

All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!

What do you think?

Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.

It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!

Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?

Is this the key to the attic?

Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?

<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!

The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.

You were wrong, it did hurt.

Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?

Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...

Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?

... And please call me Robert.

I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?

... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.

Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.

... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.

Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.

A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.

... He walked off...

Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.

I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.

Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.

I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.

Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.

Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.

Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.

Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?

These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.

I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?

Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.

Yes... I know, Chauncey.

Chauncey!

He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.

I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?

... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?

I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.

Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...

I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...

Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.

I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President.  ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail.

... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?

Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?

Yes, it is very good!

Yes, Eve. That would be good.

Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...

... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?

Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.

Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.

He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.

Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.

And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.

Certainly, Ben.

... Chauncey... Chauncey...

She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...

Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...

What about money?

Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?

I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.

This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...

Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook?  That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!

Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.

I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.

Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?

Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?

... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?

You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.

... How long have you been living here?

Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?

Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.

... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?

The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control.  He has one just like it.

What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?

I have no claim, Thomas.

Good morning, Mr. President.

You look much taller on television, Mr. President.

... In the garden?

I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.

Eve, child! How nice of you to come.

Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!

It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...

... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...

... Yeah...

No! He's a real gardener!

... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown.

I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.

... So what does all that add up to?

You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.

Say, aren't you that actor guy?

Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!

Which one is Elijah again?

Why'd you do it, Craig?

Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.

Now?

I'll meet you on the turnpike.

I have to go back.

I have to go back now.

I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.

I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.

We?

Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.

Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.

You fell in love with her first.

I need a shower.

You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.

The monkey.

A better friend.

I know.

Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...

Money, Miss Warts?

Yex?

You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.

No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.

Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.

Yes, well...

Somebody told you.

I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.

No, wait! I like your tits.  I love your tits. I want to fuck you.

Hi.

There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.

Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!

You're late.

I've fallen in love.

So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!

If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...

I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.

No. Don't be an ass.

Vegas? What'd you think?

No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.

How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?

Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.

I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.

Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.

Floris, get Guinness on the phone.

I gotta know the truth, Kevin.

Anybody else?

But why, Son of Malkovich?

But now we've lost access to Craig.

What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!

Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.

We have to meet.

Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!

Can I get you a drink?

Yes. How did you know it was me?

I'm getting better all the time.

That was incredible. You're brilliant!

This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.

Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?

Bad dream, darling?

Yeah what?!

I got a delivery around here. Name of Tucker.

You blaming God. That what you're doing?

You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?

You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.

Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...

YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?

CAN THEY GET IN HERE?

You don't sit with me!!

I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..

You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...

Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...

Well, is it now? How you getting along?

Your mother all right?

You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?

Yes?

They good whitefolks?

I want to work, Miss Lady.

I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.

She likes to see you off in the morning.

Mama let me help you.

She likes this dress...

What you want there? Somebody invite you in?

True.

Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.

I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.

Leave off..

She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.

Hey!!

Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.

Her life is in your hands.

Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.

Uh-huh.

The Gundersons.

Fuck, man!  That's terrible!

There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom is.  Those are the fucking rules.

VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY!

Excuse me?

Yeah.

Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!

Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.

Are you gonna split hairs?

Am I wrong?

What do you need that for, Dude?

Who's in pyjamas, Walter?

--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--

Please!  Please!

They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--

One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?

Yes, heh--

Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.

I like your style, Dude.

Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?

Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?

Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?

Is that what that's a picture of?

You mean coitus?

Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.

Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.

Do you have any news regarding my father's money?

Dieter Hauff?

Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?

What happened to your house?

What the fuck are you--

Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.

Am I wrong!

...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--

Have it your way.  The point is--

Oh shit.  Walter.

...Huh?

Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used to say.

Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski?

It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!

That wasn't her toe.

You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.

He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--

Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?

No.

Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!

Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?

Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?

Oh, shit.

Walter, you fuck!

Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.

I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.

Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.

What's mine is mine.

Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!

Walter Sobchak.

Shit Dude, I'm sorry--

Shut the fuck up.  Hello?

Ah fuck it.

Huh?

Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man?

Mind if I smoke a jay?

I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?

Put me down, you son of a bitch!

You monsters!

Who the hell is he?

Smokey Huh?

Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.

Whatta we do about the Mex?

What?

Where to first?

You're hurt.

Recognize him?

Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.

No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.

Anyone else make it?

Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.

Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst for good.  I'll be watching you close. You start to back-slide --

What do you really think?

I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.

What the hell is that supposed to mean?

It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too.  In that regard, I should thank you.

Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.

Nomak?

His name is Jared Nomak.

I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?

An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them, I trust.

You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.

Nobody to call in case of an emergency?

Tell me something, Skid --

Whistler!

I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --

Don't try to talk --

Whistler, I --

Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.

You shouldn't be here.

And you honestly expect me to believe all this?

Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.

Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.

Just get out of here.

Is he sick?

It won't work on you.

-- tearing me -- apart.

How's it going, Kam?

How could you be a part of this?

You don't have to be.

I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that.

The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.

How many of you are there?

But you use blood banks --

You're a monster.

Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.

On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.

--and if she ever did--

What, are you alright?

You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??

Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.

Why?

Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."

What's she look like?

You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!

Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.

Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?

This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.

I think we get the gist.

--now c'mon!

Then I'm going--

I want to see something!

Oh, Jesus, no--

--hours before--

You mind me asking: why the fuck?

Does it hurt?

Can't you like just divine it?

I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--

You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.

Nice tent.

If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.

Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.

What're you, crazy??

Get inside quick, they'll stop.

Whatta you got, telescopic vision?

She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.

--Cotter, where can I get on-line?

Not the place you want to announce your arrival.

--f'chrissake, Heather, it's not like the two of us are gonna doze off he leaves for two seconds--

Hold this.

This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--

You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?

Was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid?

Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?

There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--

How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?

Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?

She got <u>paid</u>.

What?

Cotter'll kill you.

At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide.

What is it you thought you saw on that tape?

Jesus.

We are being fucked with here, someone or something.

Why in the world would <u>she</u>--

I should check on Anna.

"It's why the witch kills children."

Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.

Could I tell him what it's regarding?

I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.

...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.

Why d'you wanna leave all this?

Where... where you going?

On the phone. Was it for you?

Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?

I could've sworn I heard something.

Hello?

Ray?... What time is it?

...You all right?

What happened?--Was Meurice there?

...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--

Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?

You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?

Well now you do.

...You know that car?

...What was that back there?

Sign.

...Just doin' my job.

Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.

...Anything else?

...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.

If the pay's right I'll do it.

...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?

...There's a big--

...What did you do with the bodies?

Don't throw that out.

That's not the point.

The point is we don't serve niggers here.

...Why?

What day is it today, Angie?

Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?

Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?

By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?

Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.

I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.

Is that why you say it's horrible?

Okay?

And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.

For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.

Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.

Hello, daddy.

Can I feel 'em?

He's comin' back?. What for?

That oughta do it.

An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.

That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?

Do you like that?

Sure I'm alright. 

Yes.

Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.

Oh shit.

I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.

Who is Don?

No. But you're in very big trouble.

Yes.

Yes. Frank-

No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.

Do you like my body?

There's no disease, I can tell you.

You called me Jeffrey.

I'll call you.

Shh. I'll tell you.

We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.

Oh yeah?

Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?

Do you know who was brought in for questioning?

It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?

What happened to him?

Alright, now tell me. What is it?

It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.

Now, how are you going to do that?

Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.

No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.

So. what's next?

I owe you. since I goofed up this one.

Yeah. but.

. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.

I'm going to wait here until she comes.

Okay. thanks.

You're sure right. It is a strange world.

You were late.

You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.

Shoot.

Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.

Yeah.

I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.

You worry about me really?

Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.

You want to dance?

Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.

What time are visiting hours?

God. you scared me.

Nothing. I'm fine.

Well.

Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!

I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.

Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.

Let us walk.  From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.

The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.

Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.

Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?

Should we buy it?

Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.

Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.

Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?

Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?

I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.

The coca is my responsibility!

I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?

Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.

Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.

I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.

Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?

What do you got there, Diego?

You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?

Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?

Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.

Diego Delgado, please?

Yeah, I'm out.

Please, continue.

A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.

I know.

Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.

Touche.

Three million.  I counted it twice.

I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?

Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough?

You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man.

Well, you know.  It's um...

G-d, son.

I just can't get over the size of that ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.

Layaway shmayaway.

Who's the cheapskate?

I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?

I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.

What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.

It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.

Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.

There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.

I know.

I know.

Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.

So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments...

You're like your mother.  You love money.

No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?

She's angry.  It's all over the news.

Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.

How are you doing, George?

You hear about your old friend, Diego?

Source?  What about Derek?

Hello.

I don't know.  My name is George.

Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.

But this is...

Where are you going?

What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!

There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.

What?

Hey, George.  You okay?

He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?

Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.

But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.

Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?

You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.

Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.

Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.

Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.

It's not enough.

Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.

I can't believe we're stealing a plane.

The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...

Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?

What's happened to you?

How much are they paying you?

With an unloaded pistol?

But I haven't shot him.

It's good nobody is following us ...

Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.

Good evening ... Can we pass?

Where were we?

Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.

Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thèbes?

And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.

You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...

What is she saying?

We'll lower a basket from the window ...

Are you ready, colonel?

Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.

I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.

Take some time off.

You did a good job, Charlie.

Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?

Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?

What induced it?

Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?

Did they argue the day before he died?

Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?

He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.

Objection sustained.

That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.

I'll tell her but she won't take it.

You've been following me?

Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.

Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.

Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?

Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?

Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?

How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?

Why not?

Can you give the court an example?

What did she do next, Mr. Roston?

What did she say?

-- And what did you suggest?

Yes.

You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?

--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?

Why does she come to you?

Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?

How do you instruct your patients to take it?

October twenty-seventh.

Where did you meet him?

-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?

I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.

I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?

If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?

How do you know that?

Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?

I suppose.

I don't know.  I'm not sure.

Who told you that?

That bastard!

Yes.

Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?

Yes.

To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.

Hi, Joe.

Yes.

Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?

You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?

Something like that.

Why not?

Is it against the law?

Hello?

Did you always want to be a lawyer?

That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?

Yes -- it would be nice.

No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.

Alone?

You were brilliant today.

Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.

You killed him -- didn't you?

Alright, I'll talk to her

What are they saying?

You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?  How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?

But Your Honor--

Really.

Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.

Humped

Yeah -- what are you doing up?

Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.

You're sleeping with her, aren't you?

It's more involved than that.

Not even if they're a dork?

How bizarre!

He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?

I thought everything WAS arranged.

Then why do you?

I used to love this place. I used to take Kathy Reynolds down here.

My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.

Well, nobody put a gun to his head.

Are you supposed to be in Iowa?

If I'm not taking you away from anything.

Oh. When did you move back?

So, how long you've been living here?

Lemon?

Where are you staying while you're here?

Help cook?

What?

Then what happened?

And did you?

Why did you stop?

Well, it's kind of buggy out there.

You drink bug repellent?

Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.

No, I'm just saying --

I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.

I would love to come for dinner.

Oh. I guess you got the whole story.

You want to eat something?

Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.

Yes.

And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!

You're somewhere else, where?

I... What do you want?

What are you doing?

Stop it!

I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.

No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.

For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.

It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.

I'm positive.

Want anything special for dinner?

Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.

About an hour ago.

Hell no!

Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.

Bones!  How baddass is zat?  This is the place for us.  Patrick, you get platinum props, man.  Platinum.

You didn't hear that?  "Take him... " Something.  "Bury him" or...

'S up?

You soundin' like the old man now.

You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.

Is this Hell?

Looking to score?

I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.

Let me see your hand.

What it will be.

He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.

Lucky thing.

The dead get out?

I'm here.

But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.

No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.

Did you do it?

Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.

You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.

You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.

12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.

Then how'd you hear it, fool?

He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."

Not really to live, just to play.

Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?

Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.

Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.

Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.

Where is this going, Johnnie?

Admit what?

Caesar?  What is this?

Gimme the gun.

We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.

Where the hell's the laundry detergent?

They were early.

What?

Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!

I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.

See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!

I need you ...

If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.

Tell them!  Tell them!

...  maybe three hours.

Where is the money?

I saved you.

Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.

Now that's teamwork.

You know he would have done you, too.

I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.

Yeah?

You got the key?

Hello?

We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --

A favor?

So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?

I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.

Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance.

I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.

You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous, Corky?

You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?

...  I needed that.

He's a launderer?

You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.

I'm glad you did.

What are you afraid of?

I don't understand - ?

Because it's the truth.

What you heard wasn't sex.

I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.

Caesar is going to get the money and bring --

All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.

What happened?

What time did you say they would be there?

I'm sorry, Corky ...

How'd it go?

Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!

I know you will.

And what if I couldn't do that?

No.  We can't risk it.

I'm going to Paris.

I won't ask again.

Are you Treadstone?

I don't know.

I don't think so.

I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?

...yes -- oui -- uh...

You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?

It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.

Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.

Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  I'm assuming you're still in the market.  It's the same vessel?

Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.

I need a ride out of here.

Please.  I don't want to scare you.

I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.

Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.

Sounds like you were in an accident or something.

WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?

You knew he was coming.

He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!

xxxxxx.

Who is it?

xxxxxx

You have ID?

-- Miss Kreutz, please --

What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.

Sir...

What the fuck is he doing?

What?

It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.

...ervices.

...Be back.

...ergency procedures.

... And then some.

You telephone, sir.

Trouble with your air-conditioning.

...ven't you?

I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.

Sign the form so we can get to it.

Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.

Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.

Go away.

What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?

Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?

Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?

Sorry ...

I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...

Too late? That's for me to say.

Sam!

You are late.

Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!

What?

OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.

OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.

We suspect him of freelance subversion.

Tell me about Layton.

Why? Hell, not for any reason ...

Trust me.

Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.

Jack, she's innocent!

Jack?... Jack?

How do you think I feel? You shit!

I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.

You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?

What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!

Why?

Why not?

Where are you taking me?

It does doesn't it?

It's heavy.

Say, all wars have innocent victims.

Look at that - right on time.

Security.

Now you're the one that's out of your mind.

I'm going to open it!

What happened to you after ...

They're gone.

Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.

I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.

Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?

But if they did promote you

A cheque.

Tuttle?

I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.

Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.

Try next of kin.

There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?

Here. What do I do next?

What! Shit!

Lime, I need to use your computer

How long will she he away?

Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.

Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.

What were we saying?

Is Mr Helpmann here?

It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.

Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?

My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?

But I could be anybody.

Yes?

No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.

But we can get one.

Sign here please.

Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.

They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.

A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.

Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount

What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.

You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.

No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.

In that time, you ever have sex?

Is this what you gave Mary?

I guess I'll be going.

Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?

Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.

Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.

You're not going to die.

Sure, sure, give go.

Do you have any music?

Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.

He's better, isn't he?

Sleeping.

Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?

Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.

Promise you won't go inside.

I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.

You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?

No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.

Who's that?

Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.

Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.

It's coming.  Hold her down.

Three legs.

I hate vodka.

He got better.

No.

He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.

He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

These are hard times, Tom.

Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?

Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!

Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.

Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!

The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo mein. It's  been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink?

Don't push it, Larry.

Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.

He's crazy.

You're in the stomach!

Answer the radio Zebra. You know it's that time.

Hi, Aaron...What's doing?

Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.

I don't like being handled.

No.  That's not going to tell us anything.  Let's get this prompter going.

You were smokin' toward the end there.

Hold it down, okay?

This story they won't cover.  And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.

I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?

Which would you prefer?

I'd give anything if that were true.

Okay.  Great line at the end.

Well, whatever you think.

Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.

Do you feel good about it?

Aaron, will you tell me?

What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...

Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.

I don't know.  I may be in love with him.

Don't go.

I think you're the Devil.

How?

So who's the guy?

I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?

Ready.

I saw the smile -- good piece.

Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...

Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...

Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?

Just a few questions?

We came from Washington.

Just when do you start, telling people?

Jane?

Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.

Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'

Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.

Do you want him all the way to the car?

How do I get out of here?

I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...

No...no.

Anchor?

Look, I can start up with him again if you really...

...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...

As long as that's your only problem you're...

Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?

One year...almost one year.

It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.

I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It was totally impressive.  Great piece.

I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --

I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.

Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?

Nervous?

Jane?

Yes.

No.  Were you going to you?

Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.

I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?

That's not it.

Hi.  It's me.

I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.

No.  Did he really?

What?

Why?

We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?

Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...

That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.

This is very awkward.

Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.

Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!

Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!

Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.

You really like it?

Look at the size of it!

How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?

Where where...

Nice night out...

Of course I do!

I'm sorry about what I said before.

Walter...stay away from me!

Are you trying to be funny?

Are you alright?

Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.

What's the matter with you?

Would you pose for me for free?

Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...

Now what kind of statue was that?

Walter, what are you doing?

Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?

Where'd ya buy that?

You...made that?

Dead Cat!

I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...

You know what that proves?

Well...why murdered man?

You might talk too much.

I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...

I want that cat.  I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.

Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -

How ya doin'?

I was going to make some pancakes, you can have some if you like.

Did you see my cat?

But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.

Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!

YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!

I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -

And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?

Why on Earth should you be so depressed?  Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!

Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.

Uh, no, I didn't see him at all.

Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?

I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!

I look horrible.

I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.

... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?

No, we didn't.

It's coffee.

Invite me in, Pike.

I'm hungry.

Did you see a girl come by here?

Which way did she go?

Excellent.

Hi, Buffy.

Do you know what time it is?

Buffy, honey?

Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...

Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.

Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.

Buffy, what are you doing here?

I don't understand.

You broke up with my machine?

You left me a message?

Will you guys shut up, please?

Is that your car?

How are you doing?

They were vampires, weren't they?

Things are kind of confusing.

Hey, Buffy...

Thanks.

Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?

Dress, huh?  What for?

I'm going to the dance.

He did what he was supposed to.

I'm going out the front.

Are you okay?

I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.

Beverly Center.

Totally stale.  And the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  We're thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?

What did Jeffrey's dad say?

Excuse me for having something important to do.

Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?

I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.

What are you talking about?

Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.

I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.

Ow.

Wait a minute.

I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?

Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!

What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?

Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?

Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.

Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.

No THX.

Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.

Well, I guess you got what you came for.

Why?  Why me?

But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.

What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?

Oh, yes!  Yes!

The homelesses?

Oh, yeah!

All right.  Take care of yourself.

Yeah maybe you're right.

You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.

The right nostril.  Good.

God...I think I'm gonna be sick--

Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--

Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.

I'm Crash Davis.

I don't dance.

She's dancing with me.

See my hips?

I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.

Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.

247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.

Your place or mine?

Well, Annie, your place or mine?

You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!

I doubt that.

I don't know if I'd go that far.

Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--

Ninety-three miles an hour.

Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...

Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?

You a God damn witch?

You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!

Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.

Why you shaking me off?

You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.

You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.

If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?

Can I ask you something?

I was playing naked.

Can't you let me enjoy the moment?

Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."

She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?

I'm trying to thank you.

Settle what?

C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.

No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!

Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya...  She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...

Crash Davis?

I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?

She's playing with my mind.

Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.

Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?

Eight and twenty-four.

Ain't here.

Well, I'd rather not say.

Look at yours.

...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.

I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...

You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!

Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?

...been right, but who knows?

Oh, good.

But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.

Okay.

Hello.

Oh. Have a good day at school.

Hello? Hello! Ginger.

...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.

You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.

Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.

What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?!

But nobody had to take care of Nicky.

After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.

No, of course not.

Ohh!

When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'

Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.

You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.

I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.

I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.

' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?

Hello.

No, no it's okay.

Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.

You should say so.

Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.

Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.

You lost your control.

Yes, you lost your control.

All right.

Now, what does she have to do with all this?

All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?

I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.

No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!

I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!

Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.

Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?

She was afraid to call you.

I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?

Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?

How'd you know I was here?

Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?

You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?

Okay. You come by the house?

Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?

I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.

To Abraham Lincoln.

He wants a fifty-thousand marker.

Okay, thank you for asking.

She took care of the dealers...

The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.

Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.

What, are you trying to handicap me?

If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?

You're kidding? My God. What is it?

You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.

Oh, fabulous.

Why do you need that much?

You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?

How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.

...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.

I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be?  Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me, right back to me.  Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I -

It's under...

Twenty-five thousand for clothes.

Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!

Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!

With Jennifer.

Why do you want to do that?

I was with somebody.

Oh...

She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.

I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.

Why don't you just let me go, Sam?

Get - Get up! Get up!

Get - get up!

I wouldn't -

She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's.

I'm afraid to let her in the house.

I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.

Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a

No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.

Well...

The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?

You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.

...worst possible time for me.

Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.

No.

No, Sir.

Well, I... I never tried.

I just wanna get out of here.

When I left here with the money...

Yeah.

Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.

No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?

Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.

Fucker!

And here. Here.

Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.

Come on. I'm sorry.

Is that what you did?

You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -

Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.

I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.

Oh.

Carmine left?

Yeah, I'm over here with him.

No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!

We're - we're placing you under arrest for -

Hey, Frankie.

I always tell you the truth, Remo.

Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.

I mean, unless Ace made his bet.

Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.

Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']

I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.

I can see that. Sure.

You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.

You know?

You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.

Yes, you did.

Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?

No, he's not.

He hates my fuckin' guts.

Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-

Come on.

What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.

I'm here.

I'm always here for you.

Don't make me come there. Answer me.

Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.

You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.

- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.

Mm-hm.

Ace saw Vegas one way.

...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here.

I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.

Yeah, thanks a lot.

They're havin' a good time too.

He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.

Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.

Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.

Take it easy!

Frankie!

Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!

I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.

I'm positive.

You're a little confused?

My fuckin' head.

Do I hear a motion seconded?

What's the matter with you?

Since when do you talk like that?

That's enough.

...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.

Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...

Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...

I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...

Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.



Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...

A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!

Are you sure?

Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?

Selina, are you okay?

You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.

We're waiting.

Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.

"Dat's gotta hurt!"

What a "drag."

My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..

Well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it.

I loved you.

Hello, Spooky.

Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring..

For when the time comes..

How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!

Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."

What if I were to say "You're Fired?"

A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.  Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up.  Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..

You are...

It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?

Maybe.

But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.

You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...

Was someone in an accident?

He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.

I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!

Say something ...

She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!

Will you two cut it out?

We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.

What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?

In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.

That's your "rep."

And stop with the directions.

Nels, don't let that cop pass you.

No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.

You're the one who's not to be believed.

Where'd they take you to?

Stop throwing names at me.

What do they need her for?

26th off Wilshire.

What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.

Hey drop it, okay?

I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.

You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?

How come everybody turns out to be a crook?

I might still get there first. The lights are with me.  How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?

I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.

No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know!

God, if he doesn't come back --

Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.

She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.

Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?

It's locked.

So far they're keeping their part of it.

He had a gun.  I have it now.

At least one.

I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!

Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.

What's that supposed to me?

It could be a fire.  This is Malibu.

What's Nels' number?

Any idea where you're going?

Think you could do a picture of me?

Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.

What's your point?

I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.

It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.

I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?

I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...

Thank God -- thank God I've got you.

Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.

Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --

Who are you working for?

You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.

I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.

Negative.

Count it.

Seems like it.

Yeah?

I can see the benefit in that.

In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.

Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?

Who were you talking to?

Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.

Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase.  So I've taken on the task.

If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.

I thought so.

You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.

Scottish?

So let's call this the usual.

You could always make it up to her.

Just cut his hair, you know.

What you think?

Good thing in a man.

Don't be like that --

No, of course not, she's a lady.

Do it on your own time, Paddy.

How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?

Who?

Tell her I'm very happy with it.

Everybody wants something.

You on the game?

He's getting up.

Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.

He lived here with you?

Shouldn't you be in mourning?

Did he come here too?

Why?

Drink.

Tell him to stop messing Dil around --

Tell him it hurt --

Sorry, darling.

Sure I do.

My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.

Do they know?

Kind of wish I didn't.

No. Can't pretend that much.

Come on.

And you're not going to tell me more?

You'd do anything for me?

You want another haircut, baby?

You promise?

You want to make me look like him...

Why?

You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.

You heard what I said, Dil?

Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.

Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.

You killed my Jody?

You tried.

See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.

You do?

What would you do for me?

Promise?

Where am I to go, Jimmy?

Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --

I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.

That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.

Fergus!

See does he want some.

Hey -- what's he like?

Have a look at him.

You don't know that.

Leave us, Judie.

Put that thing back on him, Fergus.

What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?

Eddie and Tinker died.

But you know what the thing is, Fergus?

You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.

We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.

She's nobody. She likes me.

Perfect.

We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.

Fergus, I think you don't trust me.

Why would you do that?

So?

You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.

And what's she like between the sheets?

And who is she?

Who is he?

Fuck you.

But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.

What makes you think that?

No?

You make a nice couple.

So what were you fucking around for, then?

Can't. Once I signed up.

"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.

Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.

Can't.

Fergus?

You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.

Depends on what you believe in.

She can't help it.

Help me.

I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus?

Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?

See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.

Have you no feelings, woman?

You're heading for trouble, Fergus --

You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.

It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.

Oh, you should see your face.

Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?

I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.

Lord, you're stubborn.

Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.

Now what?

Reggie -- why won't you listen?

I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?

I said, tell me to go to the --

Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.

Only we call them agents.

Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.

Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.

You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.

I believe you.

Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.

We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.

I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.

No, what?

Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --

Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.

We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.

I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?

Are you sure there's no mistake?

It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.

No.

No.

Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --

Then how do I know this is your office?

Bartholomew?

Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?

And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.

Good morning, Mr. Dyle.

Whitefoot, of course.

I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.

I'm not fifteen.

Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.

He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.

Or Tex?

Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.

I'd love some, thanks.

Got you.

What are you doing?

The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.

It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.

Yes.

I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.

In human life? In greed? In suffering?

Forty-five thousand.

A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.

Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.

Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?

Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.

I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.

You loved him?

Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?

I don't understand.

Oh, la.

Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.

Please, not on my account.

I'm not sure I --

Yes, but we're divorced.

It's terrible -- you just made it up.

What are you doing here?

Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.

Peter -- are you all right?

No, they won't -- I won't let them.

Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?

Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.

Stop that!

Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?

He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --

He knows everything.

Who is it from?

What is it about?

Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?

Yeah? What's that?

Shoot no, not after all these years.

Yeah?

If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?

ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?

Good.

Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?

No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.

A little.

Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!

Not much further.

Ok.

No honey.

You know her?

We're seeing all the signs in town.

Of what?

No.

We just found another body.

We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.

_ Your father raped someone?

Mark Shale.

What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'

Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.

Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.

I don't know what I'm so scared of.

Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.

Especially not your dad.

This place is empty.

You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.

I heard you got attacked.

Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.

You know I want to go with you.

What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?

Mom?

I need to ask you something.

I don't know. Where did you hear that name.

Did he say anything else about her?

No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.

Two men left town right after it happened.

Kenny's aunt?

On what side of the family?

You ok?

What are you doing?

There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.

Hey! That was a 3k machine.

I said no.

Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?

Stacy?

help me get in the truck. 

 Oh, shit.



Where's Sam?

He could've called first.

No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...

Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.

Then you drive me to McGrud-...

All right, then how about this?



I ain't goin' through Missoula!

You stole this truck!

I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.

 

...work!  It's not even load-...

Okay!  All right!

Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...

Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...

...I believe in live and...

...let live.

It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...

Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.

Holy shit...

Come on, old...

...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!

Fuck! 

Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!



Come on.

What the fuck was that?!

Gee, you think so?

...ho!

Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!

All right.

 Aw, shit  

Yeah, he's a dangerous...







...truck.

Not completely, anyway.

 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...

Ow!  

We're gonna die!





Stop.

Aw, shit.  Would you be more care-...

Oh, shit.

And Brynner's right on...

...tunnel!



Come on.  Come on.

What?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Sorry.

Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.

What'd you come back for?!

Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.

...truck that kept Elvis cool?

You.

...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...

Us.  Owes us.

 Yeah.

Thank you very much.

No.

We're worried...

I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...

I urge you to be persuasive.

Well, that just about figures for today.

 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 

...take my sorry old truck.

You got a prob-...

Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!

All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job.



Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!

Looks like it.  Yes, sir.

...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.

Now listen to me.

"I am become Death, the...

No, go--

You look fit...healthy...

...-ple.

...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.

"Went away."  I like that.

All right.  After they put you away...

Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?



 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.





Carl!  Set up the camera.

Hit him again.

Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.

Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.

Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?

Right.  Tim Mason.

Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...

...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...

Iced coffee.

Quite a getup for jacking...

...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...

Yeah?

And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.

...-tainer!



Yeah?

Rangers.

No sign of 'em...



Is Elvis out?

Thanks. 

Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.

Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?

Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...

Mason.

And what if it does?

And only then does our noble friend realize...

Well, your prediction was on the nose.

Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis?!

Mason.  Mason!

There's a vent shaft leading straight up.

So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...

You find yourself wearing a...

...to talk, son.

I said let me see your hands now!

 Listen, Pappas...

 Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...

  All right.

 Talk to me.

 We've gotta take out Brynner's van before  they reach...

Uh, so head for the other end of the tunnel.

I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact  it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.

An honest living.

I'll settle for L.A. County.

It's why you attract a client like my daughter.

We worked in Chinatown together.

If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.

Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?

At my age, you tend to lose track...

Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.

I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.

Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...

Where is she?

There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.

How do you do that?

Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?

I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.

What kind of guy do you think I am?

In the garage.

So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.

That's a filthy habit.

Yes.

Congratulations.

What are you doing here?

How do you happen to know her?

Isn't that your number?

Yeah, I took 'em. So what?

I want the rest of the pictures.

I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?

Give you three minutes.

Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.

Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!

You and your husband never discussed her?

A complete surprise?

Not that Mulwray?

Iced tea.

My husband's at the office.

I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.

What?

Yes, Mr. Gittes?

No. I went riding rather early.

Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.

I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.

Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.

You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.

Mr. Gittes.

I mean I can't tell you.

Another satisfied client?

Over the water department, or over you?

Oh, yeah?

You sure shout that?

That dam is a con job.

The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.

Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?

We got it. We got it, baby.

Working for the District Attorney.

As little as possible.

Boy oh boy, you're a mess.

...No. Why was it.

What about it?

And I want to know where.

I know.

What does it look like?

I can't...

Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.

You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.

You know any good criminal lawyers?

Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...

Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?

Sophie.

Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.

Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.

Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?

Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?

Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?

Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.

He never even kids about it.

Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?

Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?

Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?

I don't understand.

Hard working, have a wife and kids...

Mr. Gittes?

Do you know me?

Have we ever met?

When it comes.

That's a long fall.

It's bone dry, Morty.

How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?

No, really?

Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?

Then go home and forget about it.

All right, what's your husband's first name?

Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.

Gee whiz.  And I'm late.

This?

What about?

Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.

Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.

Neither do I.

Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.

Course, she settled down nicely.

Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.

You must not come here! How many times do I have to tell you?  If the film catches fire, runt that you are, you'd go up in a burst of flame...whoosh! And turn into a piece of...

What are you doing here?

Signora Maria, don't do that. He's just a kid.  And why are you telling fibs?  We let him in free. He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre...  How much did you have?

Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.

I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? 

You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .

Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess? 

Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 

But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!

No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 

Father, I have sinned...

He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.

No...It's nothing to do with you. It's just that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it's quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation...

Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?

Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -

"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -"  I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.

I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?

Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.

Who else did you see?

Do you, Mr. Leland?

Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -

Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?

I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.

How do you do?  I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me...  because I recieved this note -

What story, Mr. Rogers?

Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -

Emily, you -

I know it is, Brad -

Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen -

Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -

Oh yes, there is.

I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea -

Where's the soap?

No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -

Would you sing for me?

I mean in New York.

Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!

I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.

I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.

Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.

Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!

You'll never have another chance to hit me again.  I never knew till this minute -

Don't tell me you're sorry.

I won't let you go.

I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.

"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.

Is Mrs. Kane - 

Do you like poetry, Raymond?

How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?

The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.

Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?

I'm drunk.

I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.

All right.

She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.

Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.

I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.

I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.

Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -

Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...

Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.

That's the whole works, right up to date.

The banks are out of luck, eh?

Why don't you people let me alone? I'm minding my own business.  You mind yours.

He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.

I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?

What's this?

Well, if it's already too late...

It's not the same.

Excuse me, but...

If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.

I think you'd better leave now.

You can hold me down.

You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.

A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.

You're kidding.

You're just going to lock the store like that?

Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.

Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?

Look how full of yourself you are.

The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.

How'd you get here so fast?

Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?

I can't believe this! I feel faint...

Then who operated the store?

My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.

Well, he missed!

All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.

Pack of cigarettes.

I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.

You open?

What am I worried about?  He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests.  I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.

All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.

The boss called. Arthur fell ill.

That's what I said.

What smells like shoe polish?

You don't want to know.

I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.

You win.

Five years.

She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.

Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?

Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.

Empire.

Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.

What's that?

Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.

There aren't.

The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.

He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?

So, what-you're stuck here all day?

That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.

The fact that I'm right about your buckling?

Design major.

Oh, my god.

I haven't seen her in almost two years.

Stop it. This is beneath even you.

She meant nothing to you!

Shut the hell up.

Because I never tried to suck my own dick?

His dick was in his mouth?

I could never reach.

You know.

Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.

You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!

Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?

Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?

You're happy?

Wow. You've had quite an evening.

I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?

Hey, what about Veronica?

You just fucked a total stranger?

Have some chips; you'll feel better.

That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?

It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.

You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.

What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.

How's your eye?

How do you figure?

To talk to you.

Just the paper.

I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.

You know him?

Yes, they are. You're out of shape.

And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?

What?

All right. How much is Pepsi here?

It's not like it's a demanding job. I'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV. The other day I walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping.

What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!

Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.

Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.

Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there... to read?  It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on.

You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.

I said go ahead.

All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.

And I actually date you?

I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.

You've slept with twelve different girls?

What do you mean?

Sylvan can be talked into anything.

Like you said-she snowballed him.

I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.

How many?

How many dicks have you sucked?!

A few?

What is it?

Really?  You're the best.

Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?

You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?

Check this out, he's from Russia.

No way!

That doesn't sound metal.

I do about three-fifty, four.

Feel that.

Holy shit! She told you about that!  Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.

I beg your pardon!

You hope what feels good?

I... I don't know what to say.

After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!

I know. I've been here since eleven.

I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.

I have first dibs.

Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.

Like hell you are!

Gabe!  Hey, man!  Gabe!  It's Gabe!

Work!  Don't say that word, man.

Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.

Hal's signalling he's OK.

He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff?  Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft.

If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.

And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.

Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.

Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.

You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.

Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--

How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?

What are we going to do?

Use your other hand!  Grab it!

That's a virtue isn't it?

Enough.

Where've you been?

Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.

I know...

Resuscitation?

If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.

I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--

Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!

Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.

What was God thinking when he built this place?

Gabe!  Are you alright?

She's a lyin' bitch!!

These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.

My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.

The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.

Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.

Travers, you're not running things.

What's your names?

He asked you, how far?!  I think you've been taking the scenic route.  How far from here?

Got to be Comb Bluff.

What the hell are you doing--

Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!

No names, this is an open line!

Appreciate it.

Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.

What did you do that for?

Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.

Come on, Alex. Come for walkies. Hahahahaha.

Dear, dear, dear. Whatever happened to you, my boy? Mr. Alexander, now confined to a wheelchair, pushes himself away from his desk, and rolls up to Julian. The water drips off Alex's clothes. They look at each other.

I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!

My wife... Alex freezes.

Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.

You've not been to school all week, son.

Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three look up startled.

Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?

When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?

Do you feel that way now?

Do you still feel suicidal?

Who said that?

I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.

Helping you, sir?

Well, who can blame them, sir?

What about Basil? Where's my snake?

What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?

... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.

I wanna be sick.

Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?

Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?

No, sir.

No, sir.

Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.

Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.

Oh no, nothing of the sort.

Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.

Something like that.

I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.

You've heard Beethoven before?

I'm your Psychiatrist.

Yes?

Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.

I hope so. Is that the end then?

How many did I get right?

And when do I get out of here then?

You're keen on music?

You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.

Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.

Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.

Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.

No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.

Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.

One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.

Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.

Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.

How many to a cell?

Sixth is faster.

Let me guess.  Clarinet?

Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.

Like what?

Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.

Max, the cab driver!

You still carrying passengers?

No.

Get outta here!  You and Louis?

You know Dmitri?

Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?

What?

Vincent.  Do not cross me.

Something going on?

...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...

Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.

...if they're wrong?!

Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?

Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.

I was with Max when he got the call.

It got crashed!  I didn't...

You should start a union.

Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?

You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.

What?

Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.

Try some deep breathing.

Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...

Are you breathing?

I can't believe this.

Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.

So what?

Another collateral.

...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?

Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...

Max?  What are you doing?

Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.

Show up for what?

Show up for <u>what?</u>

Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...

Mom, Vincent's not interested.

You take one more step, I'll kill her.

What the fuck was <u>that?</u>

Paid sick leave?

Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.

What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?

Who's Heller?

You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...

<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...

Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?

They said send you downstairs.

The sound of love.

That's love.

Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.

I never told her.

Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?

Testing some top secret seismic weapon.

I better get going.

What was your horse's name?

What's the charge?

Just relax.

Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.

People do have heart attacks.

He says a dog bit his nose.

Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.

People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?

See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?

You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?

You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.

Here it is.  <u>Conspiracy Theory</u>  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.

Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?

You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?

Was that who I thought it was?

You gave me an hour; now give me a day.

I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?

So what's the question?

You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.

Did you see the van back there?

Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.

And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.

Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.

Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.

You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.

Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.

Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?

I don't.  I know you wouldn't.

You look great.

Liza?

Did you kill my father?!

Love at first sight?

I'm sorry.

Blue moon...

How did you know?

Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?

I love you, too.

Do I know you?

I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?

Excuse me?

Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.

A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?

Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.

In Jerry's safety deposit box.

Ah, your psychotic is here.

When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.

I want to believe you, too.

What gave me away?

We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.

There's no plug to pull.

... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?

You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?

Dr. Arroway --

-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'

Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent.

Peter sends his regards.

Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.

Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.

Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.

I want you to listen to me, carefully.  The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.

Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.

I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.

Right.  Well.

Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...

Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.

Dr. Lunacharsky...?

What...

And?

Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.

Here, right around Centaurus A.

It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.

You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.

Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.

I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.

... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.

Could we hear to the moon?

Pensacola.

You're not real.  None of this is.

So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?

So who -- what -- are you?

Am I one... or many?

... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.

I didn't realize I was out.

You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?

Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.

What's that?

It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.

The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.

Hokkaido Island.

I thought you were here because you want to go.

He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.

I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.

It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...

Greenbank?

And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.

Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.

That you, Valerian?

Ellie -- are you okay?

Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?

Spoken like a true believer.

... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.

Do you love your parents?

Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.

I don't think so.

It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.

If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.

Do you really believe your life is meaningless?

Ellie --

... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.  How did you do it?  How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?

You're trembling.

What...?

Ellie, what is it?

What?

I'm in love with you, Ellie.

You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.

It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.

But --

... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?

... as have all attempts at internal analysis.  We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable.

I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---

I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.

Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.

You never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? It wasn't such a hell of a life.

You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?

No.

Go hard!

Comin' out here, Boss?

You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...

What's all this dirt in the yard?

Here's the Patrol.

Here, Captain.

You can't do that!

Borrowin' or payin' back?

I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'!

So then you just call him.

Jus' take it slow, buddy.

Dragline, lemme look at the picture.

Well, whatta we got here?

Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.

Man, this here Newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself Luke don't know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.

Lucille? Where do you get that?

Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?

You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?

Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out.

Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...

That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.

Man, it's so hot.

I gotta believe. Out!  Now they're rollin'.  King-five-four gets an eight.  Pair'a nines with a Jack gets a four. Ninas still up.

Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.

But -- but --

Stop that.

I don't see no sign of guts in you.

I hate this...

You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.

It's good medicine.

I got it myself... I couldn't wait.

I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.

Oh God.  I'm really crazy.

Cellulite.  What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym.  Aerobics with housewives...

I want to die.

We'll get the paramedics...

Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...

You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?

Where is it?

Ah ha.  What did he want?

I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.

How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?

You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.

What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?

For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.

Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.

Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.

Who is this?

No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.

I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.

Would you want to work with us on this?

She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?

Who turned off the Internet computer...

Ruben.

Is that it?

Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?

He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...

Halloran.

What's that siren?

They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!

I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both!

Maybe you should...

I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.

Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.

This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.

You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.

It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you.

It's gone.  The file's not here.  What did you do?

Are you always so bold?

Yes.

They all have one...

You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.

Just get out of your vehicle...

You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...

What am I wasting my time with this shit for?

Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?

You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.

What's wrong with him?

You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?

You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...

She's blue as hell.  No marks on her neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same -- no ligature marks.  Outdoors...

Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.

You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?

What's Abba?

This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.

Sergeant?

Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?

Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.

How'd you get in on the deal?

You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...

She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...

I just got here myself, Susan.

Detective Niccoletti?

We were together six years, sir!

Poor darling.  What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.

There, that's better.

Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.

I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.

They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.

I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport

After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one?  I'm trying to find Charles's car.

The airport? Why? Are you leaving?

I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.

Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?

Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?

And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?

Are we allowed to park here?

You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.

What is it?

What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?

I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.

I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project.

Patient.

I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.

I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.

So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.

What's up with you?

How?

Maybe.

Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.

You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?

What do you think of this one?

What's all the dreck?

Do we have to talk wedding details?

Oh no.

Mom, please.

I gather he's late as usual.

Oh, Letty, what happened?

Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.

We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.

Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.

Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?

I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.

I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.

You can only do what feels best to you now.

First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?

It's no big deal.   We all compare.

What are you looking to read?

But you're checking it out.

John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.

He asked me to marry him.

A small price.

We'll get caught.

Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.

You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."

John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.

Yeah.

Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?

What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?

How can you not like the Top 10 List?

Good luck.

Four interviews. Four no-gos.

Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?

I sure know what that feels like.

Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.

I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.

What are we going to do?

Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.

Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.

Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?

But what about that math project?

Forget I asked.

Maybe you ought to see a doctor.

Are you all right?

No.

Especially now.

I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?

No, you've done a perfect job.

Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.

Have you been seeing another teacher?

Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.

Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.

What about me? Aren't I a loose end?

What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?

They left about a half hour ago.

Who?

Oui.

Where's your brother?

Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.

I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.

Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?

Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.

He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.

Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?

You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--

I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.

We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.

And for my help I would get what?

I only have your word for that.

Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.

Hopefully no one.

Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!

Bring me the scissors.

Turn on the flashlight.

I thought they came with batteries.

You think it's smart to tell him we're French?

You're sure?

Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.

After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.

They'll be waiting for us at the airport.

Does it really matter what I say?

Don't bullshit me.

Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.

Okay, we're square now, right?

Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.

And the other car?

Are you forgetting who supplements your income?

Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?

What do we do?

No, I didn't.

They don't serve wine here.

This kind.

I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --

I knew I should have driven.

There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.

No.   How much?

C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.

This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.

What happened?

I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.

Yeah.

I think we went the wrong way.

When do we go?

You ever hear of jet lag?

Casandra. Old girlfriend?

It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?

Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.

What are you doing?

I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.

Frankie, I --

I don't care about your sword.

Do you know her?

Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.

I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.

No, really?

Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.

Here you must be in proper attire.

You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!

Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.

No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?

I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.

Don't send me back!

You were enlightened?

What was it?

Jade Fox?  Impossible.

No, not yet...

True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?

Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.

Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.

They're gone.

I don't know...

I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.

Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?

But the sword could be in his compound.

He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.

You buying?

And I say I'm dead... and I move.

Are you nuts, walking into a gun?

You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --

I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...

You look like a rock star without a job.

My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.

What's going on...?

Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...

Do you know what you destroyed?

Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!

What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --

We've got company.

I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".

Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.

Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.

Have we met?

Are you okay?

Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?

No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?

What do you mean?

You promise not to say anything?

Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?

Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?

Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.

Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.

The Fountainhead.

You need help.

At this hour? I don't think so.

This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.

Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.

That's also none of your business.

You truly want to do something to make me happy?

No, not at all.

I'm... I'm alright.

What?

Lighten up.

Oh dear, are you actually laughing?

My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.

Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.

Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.

Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.

I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --

This isn't working out for me anymore.

It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.

- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.

Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?

Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?

Oh, I suck. I suck.

What are the boys like?

I'm in the bath, mom.

What was that?

So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.

What are you scared of?

Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?

What are you saying?

That's so romantic. Have you responded?

Cecile, you have to tell me.

What do I do then?

What year are you in?

Excellent.

I look terrible.

Need any company?

Want a blow job?

No. This is going to be our last session.

You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.

Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.

Good luck, Sebastian.

Oh baby... oh baby...

I'm pretty sure she did.

She bought it.

Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?

Where is she?!

And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...

I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.

Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?

What are the terms?

I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.

In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.

You can put it anywhere.

Call me later.

You would not believe what--

What's wrong with you?

Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.

Who are you spying on?

Morning!

If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.

Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.

A little melodramatic, don't you think.

Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?

Well done.

To my triumph, of course.

In any event, you still owe me my reward.

I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.

You're too kind.

Not at all. What's wrong?

What about her?

Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.

We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.

I love the smell of pine.

But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.

What are saying, darling?

What song, dear?

Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?

Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?

Where is everybody?

What is it, Alice?

I haven't had my breakfast.

That's the Farren house.

But I told her to go with you.

Did you mail then?

Amy, not that old tree!

What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?

Why didn't you run after them?

Now Amy

Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  I'm sick of this sort of thing.

I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.

These are all from me.

Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.

I've wanted a friend.

Will you be friend for always?

You'll always play with me?

Can't you get it, darling?

There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.

Oh, how beautiful!

Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.

Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.

Bad luck to see death in the snow.

But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.

Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?

Mother! You called me by name!

There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.

It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.

I thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.

I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.

No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.

Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.

Wow your body's really hot.

A dog at Victoria's Secret?

That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...

And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.

Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.

He's a very talented musician.

Or if there's a full moon.

Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.

George bit you?

He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.

Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.

You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.

You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?

You expecting someone?

This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."

I'm cleaning my stove.

I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.

I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.

Hello?

I know.

I do development for TV movies.

Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf.

So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "Son, you got into Harvard!" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating.

No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.

You should have gone at the restaurant.

Look what you did!

Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...

I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.

No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.

You busted me.

Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.

It's stupid.

A lot of people don't wear underwear.

You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?

Everything okay?

No, why?

You didn't say it.

You at least owe me the truth.

Be careful!

We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.

No, it was our first date.

We can get a warrant if you like.

So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger...

Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?

How the hell is that your business?

Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.

What?

I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.

She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.

I need something to keep me awake.

The city.  I need to get to the ocean.

Police.  Nobody move.

Doctor!  What brings you here?

That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...

It seems fine.

Who is it?

People...  after me.

Don't know that either.

Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...

Which one?

Water?

What does she say?  The woman.

Bad dreams?

Horrible...

We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.

It's a trick.

How do I get there?  Tell me.

You understand what you'll be doing?

For a month.

What the hell is this?

The Washington Post.

Lots of shelters were in this bill.

Oh... I'm fired?

They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.

Where's the girl?

We think so.

You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.

Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.

I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.

What about the wife?

It's a homeless shelter.

Alan, we still have to control this guy...

Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?

I don't think so

I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?

Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...

You sure?  A Coke or a Perrier or something?

Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...

It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.

Will he be alright?

No.

Alan...

We've got to fix this.

You ever think back to how you started.

Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.

What's that?

You sure you don't want a lift back home?

Oh... Yeah.

When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates.

Where are you going?

Where's home?

Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.

How were you gonna get home?

I really don't have much of an appetite.

That's a secret.

It was okay?

I never thought I'd...

I missed...

So this is it?

Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?

Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please.

Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!

Then why did you come here?

What is it?

It can't be. Are we truly in hell?

Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'.

Sir. It's quite clear that...

THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...

Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.

Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's

The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!

Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.

He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.

We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!

I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.

They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.

What is it?

What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels?

What?

I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...

Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours.

You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.

I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.

Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.

Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.

I want you to leave. Then maybe...

I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.

Tricks...Jesus...

Sounds boring to me.

How was dinner?

It will?  How do you figure?

Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!

Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?

Mr. Keating!

Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?

I think he's sweet.

No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.

Yes sir.  We were just talking about that.

Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.

I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a refresher in Latin.  Eight o'clock in my room?

Who's in?

You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.

What happened? Were you kicked out?

Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.

Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,

Hello?

Chris!

Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?

They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.

Very good, Mr._?

The hoi polloi.  Doesn't it mean the herd?

John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?

A yawp?

A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.

Come on boys, don't be shy.

Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?

You really think I should forget her?

Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!

All right!  What'd she say?

Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me.

Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?

You know what the dead poets would say: Gather ye rosebuds while ye may...

Any group pictures in the annual?

But father, I'm assistant editor.

I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?

You know what this means to your mother, don't you?

Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!

Weird.

I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.

My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.

What?

And now he will?

Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?

None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it?

No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.

Neil, you're not gonna...

Todd, what's the matter?

Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!

Visit from my father.

Who?

And what? These things are octopusses?

Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.

Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.

Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?

Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...

I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?

I'm not rich people.

Seen a lot of islands?

Self sufficient...

So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?

I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...

Where's you friend?

Shut up! You hear me!!

Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud.

...Jagger was here...I was here...

I think he knows that Joey.

Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?

I've never seen you so congenial with a mamber of the opposite sex... The two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport...

I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...

And what have you come up with?

You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?

You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.

What was that?

Check it out!

What's there to think about?? That THING back there...

She fucked us both.

Fucking women, man...

You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.

Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!

Yes, Albert?

And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--

It is not!

It's gotta be the next one. I mean it's gotta be! Right, Albert?

What the --!

You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.

That's new, isn't it?

He's real bad, Nick.

Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.

Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.

I have to go.

She's in back.

Vince. Hey, you guys --

Rough, huh?

Sal.

Kind of. You didn't know?

Biederman! Where's Biederman!

Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.

That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.

I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --

Okay.

I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!

How are you?

Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?

How's the trailer?

Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?

No-o-o!

Yeah... All the guys, we're all going huntin'. Like we did. You know? Like we always used to.

Linda... Honey, what's wrong?

Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?

Who the hell is he?

Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.

Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?

Merle?

You should have put that on last night.

That way it sets.

I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.

It's ahead, by the tree.

I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.

Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!

No. No way!

Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?

Bullshit! That's bullshit!

No.

Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.

Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!

Did you go hunting.

You didn't get a deer?

Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary?

How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?

How's it feel, huh? How's it feel to be back?

Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words.

Down I would say... What would you say?

Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.

Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.

That's him.  Simon Doucet.

You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.

You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.

Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.

You two fucks listen up.  Doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit Technothugs.

Sir, your limo's here.

You sure?  I can help you.

Maybe I should put on the training whe---

I drive.

I'll inform dispatch.

We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.

You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.

Can I ask you something?

Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about?

Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?

NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  That's when we'll get him.

It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?

What's this place?

You need anything else?

Hey, I'm eating.

Wanna try?

You're not pregnant, are you?

Sanchez...?

I just heard.

You be careful.

He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.

Seat's too high.

Yes.

Hi.

Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?

Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.

We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.

I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.

No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?

And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?

Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!

Anybody can see that.

But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.

Daniel, you ought to be in bed.

Mama!

Howdy, Jabez.

Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?

What do you want?

She couldn't be gone!

I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --

-- in gold.

Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late.

You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --

Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.

It's mine?

Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.

Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--

Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?

You know darn well it is.

I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.

Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!

Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!

Coming along, Jabez?

Why -- good morning, Squire.

Dan'l Webster?

You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.

" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?

Jabez!

Mary--

What do you think of that, Jabez?

But I'm glad to be home again --

Worried!

But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --

What happened.... Where are you taking him?

Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?

Why don't they come --

Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!

Hush up such talk, Jabez!

Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!

Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.

Hello, Sheriff.

You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.

She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!

Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.

It is.

I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.

Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!

Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!

And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.

I wanted to give it all to the church.

If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears.  ...Or is he married?

Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.

Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.

You're all right, Argyle.

Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...

Hope I'm not interrupting...?

Nothing...

I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --

You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...

How long?

Three down, four to go --

Go on.

Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him.

Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.

I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --

I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.

How do you know?

You sound like a man with a couple of kids.

Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --

The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.

Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?

Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --

Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?

So whatsa deal?

What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?

These seats come out?

Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry...

No.  Look, we're kind of....

Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?

Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.

That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.

I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...

Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.

So!  Sal is with you?

Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!

Would you do something for me? Please?

Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...

I don't have a choice.

He's makin' threats in there.

Yeah.

You frisk me.

I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?

Okay, give us the women.

Calm down, you're not ...

He wanted to kill me!

I want a helicopter to get outa here!  And a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  Outa the country, so no little jets.  A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.

Okay, what do you give me?

The girl hostages.

Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...

Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...

We're all set at Kennedy.

Okay, is the vault open?

What's the matter with you?

Howard, give him the keys...

What if I take you with me?

You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?

Where's the air conditioning?

They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.

You know ... I like you people ... I really do.

You all right?

Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.

Your body is the temple of the Lord.

You mean that?

He wants one.

Okay, Sal ... what do we do?

You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country.

What'd he say?

Why couldn't he talk about that here?

There it is, Sal.  Sal?

Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.

That's the jet.  You give us one more, now.  That's the deal...

Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet.

What are you trying to pull?

Hey, you okay?

Here's your document, Sonny.

Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.

You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?

She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!

Not now, Mom, please.

What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?

The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.

What is it, Choco?

So what?

Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.

Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.

You motherfuckin' Tino. You fucked us so bad.

We need hostages. Celebrity hostages. Just in case this gets ugly. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- LATER ON </b> The Cast Winnebago drives through the desert.

Hello?

Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.

<i>Now the bitch was getting personal.</i>

Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?

LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!

<i>After dad passed on, Mum's agenda was to hit the town and find another husband with a boatload of cash.</i> <b> INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- EVENING </b> Sophie is dolled up for a night on the town... CLEAVAGE spilling out of her cocktail dress. Domino is feeding her pet GOLDFISH. "THUNDERBIRDS" plays on the television.

Really? Did you play in a band?

Can you tell?

Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please!

Make us a pot of coffee, Edna.  It's gonna be a long night. <b> EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Edna stands next to her MAIMED SON near the burning barrels as they watch the Winnebago drive off into the desert. Locus is sobbing... latching onto his mother's sweater.

Get Cynthia on the line. <i>They changed the fucking font.</i>

This could break new ground in terms of traditional host models. It's self-reflexive reality television.

Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.

Just like Billy Ocean says. <i>When the going gets tough...</i>

Talk to me.

Ya back is got.

What did he do this time?

Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.

Extra cheese is two dollars. Y'know dat.

Mookie.

The evil eye doesn't work on me.

You're a drunk fool.

Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'.

Do me a favor.  Go to work.

I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.

Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.

Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...

Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.

How many you say?

ML?

Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?

Mookie, what took you so long?  I got a business to run.

Mookie, get offa da phone.

Mookie!  How is anybody gonna call in?

Sal, just this once, do me that solid.

I'm not guilty of nuthin'.

You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.

Do we now?

Keep it.

Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.

Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.

You a blue-moon fool.

Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?

Tina, you're sweating.

It's cold.

Later for you.

You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.

Act like one then.  Be a man.

Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?

Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.

Yeah.

I don't know.

Pino, I work hard like everybody in here.

Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.

Hey!  Watch it.

Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.

I should have Vito go with you all the time.

Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?

Then we could try something else.

You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.

Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a place of business.

You're it.

Oh my god, are you alright?

I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate?

You're the kid who was home schooled.

Hey guys.

Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?

Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special

O'clock?

Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal.

Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.

Just down the hall.

My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.

Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.

Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.

Then a sleep-over is okay by me. Okay boys, eat up.

Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!

No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?

No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.

I think it's just over there.

No, it's a treasure map.

What?

Maybe we should ask Jessica to join the class.

If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.

That would be me, sir. The wife made stew last night.

What's with horse-boy, now he's a bright shiny sun?

A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.

Can he do that?

Owww... refreshing.

According to the map, we're just about at school.

Who's your partner?

She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.

You have beautiful eyes.

Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!

JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.

HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?

A raft.

George Washington!

PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!

You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.

I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.

What? What did we do?

A float!

Ready Lloyd?

Guys, this is much better.

Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?

Hey there goes Principal Collins!

Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?

Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?

So what did you say to my parents on the phone?

Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!

What?

Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.

So could you get us into the principal's office?

Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.

I'm so close I can feel it.

HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.

What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.

Sure.

Okay.

Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.

Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?

LLOYD, may I see you a minute?

What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?

Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching.

Ha! Too big to make the turn!

I'm not sure if I can do this.

Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...

And, take some more pictures.

You got the Extender?

Everything?

Oh, just like the President.

What papers?

Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.

She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.

Are you going to kill her?

Many machines on Ix... new machines.

Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.

I can assure you...

So, this is Leto the Just...

Things have been so serious here lately.

Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.

You know the ancient tongues?

Do you know this my lady?

Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?

What does she fear?  What about my Father?

I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.

Is he....?

He knows.

You've worn a stillsuit before?

Always?

Long live the fighters!

THE PAIN!

Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?

The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.

Greetings.  I am the Count.

Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>!  It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!

I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!

Who are you?  What do you want?

They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!

They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.

Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.

I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.

Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.

Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.

Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --

Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!

Let me take you to the hospital.

"Greetings.  I am the Count."

No Bela, that's "incorporates."  Look, just say "This casket has..."

Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.

You'll be sitting on the right.

What is this place?

In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.

Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...

Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?

Eddie, this is quite a scene.

Why are you here??

What happened?!

Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?

Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?

So guess where I'm going next weekend?

This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!

PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!

And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!

You really think so?

Wow.

Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?

Will he be okay?

We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.

No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.

Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?

How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?

Ed, who is Daniel Davis?

But there's plenty of other parts.

None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.

Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.

The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.

Oh, "Dr. Acula."  I get it.  I don't like it.

Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."

Yeah...?

"Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.

I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.

Mr. Reynolds!

Could we moovf to table?

Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?

Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.

Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're in a trance.  You glide in and get on the operating table.  Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down.  But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.

I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.

I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!

What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??

Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.

"Where's the ads"?!  The ads are in Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri!  You schmuck, it ain't gonna play L.A.!

Hello.

I got married last night.

The marriage already ended.

What are you making?

You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.

Oh.  Okay.

The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?

You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --

Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?

The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there?

Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.

Ed, you said you were getting permission.

You're <u>sure</u>???

Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.

What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!

Mr. Wood?  <u>What do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?!

B-but it's our money --

Wow.

Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.

ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.

They celebrated the common person.

You thought it was me?

Did you see that?

Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.

What did you study?

Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?

Great line.

Ed, do you want my advice?

Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --

I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.



I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.

You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?

Eddie? ...

Are the TV people with you?

No. It's a mess.

I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.

You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.

I mean, that worked out.

Yes.

He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.

She had white shoes.

St. Joseph's.

Oh my god! On TV!

One thing led to another. He was my husband once.

She won't.

I can't?

I batted!

Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.

Yeah...

Are you sure about this?

Don't defend that horse's ass to me.

Really?

Oh my God.

Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.

It's really a tremendous turnoff.

I wish my stepfather was here.

Everybody hates me!

Page three of the Post.

Twenty-nine.

There's a list.

So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.

I'm sorry.

Where?

I need to talk.

What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!

No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.

My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.

But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah?

You know, that would be like a great thing.

Yeah. I service video equipment.

Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal

Who is it?

Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!

Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.

You don't recognize me.

Who is it?

I was in jail.

Check forging.

I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.

Mm.

Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?

By the X.

In love?

I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --

One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.

What do you mean? What kind of person am I?

Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up

What?  Right.  So let's start counting.

Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.

Mr. M.?

Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.

NO, that's fine

These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.

A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.

I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.

What do you mean?

Plenty of pep, too.

Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?

I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.

Jim, where the hell have you been?

Okay.  But is this about the posters?

Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.

Which door?

Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.

I can't afford this stuff right now.

So what do you think?  Should we get a room?

All his life.  He's tried everything.

Hey Yeah?

What do you want, Jim?

I was lonely.  You took advantage

Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --

253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.

Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.

You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --

People can see this.

Hell, good luck!

Can I sign yours too?

Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.

I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.

Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?

You use words like that, you might make me mad.

Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.

Tell me about Patchett.

There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?

Did they deserve it today?

But you did it anyway.

It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?

Do you like being a cop, Bud?

Did you talk to Exley?

Dudley, what do you want?

He helped me out once.  That's all.

Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.

I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide.

How what, Wendell?

You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.

You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.

You know him?

Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.

Yeah, that's Stens.

What happened?

A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?

Why?

Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.

Dudley.

Dudley's guys.

It all keeps coming back to Dudley.

Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.

What?

Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.

Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.

Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.

She's fine.

Where's the other guy?  Buzz.

That's right.

No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --

Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.

Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?

Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?

Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.

I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.

Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?

Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?

What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!

You're wrong.

No.

No.

You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.

Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.

Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.

A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.

<u>No</u>.

Something like that.

Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.

Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?

Damnit...

Glasses.

I need to speak to you.

Damnit... <u>What</u>?

Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?

Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.

She is Lana Turner.

What are you going to do?

What's on the call sheet?

The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?

If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.

Do you think I ever could've been in the running?

It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?

Let my Susie rest in peace!

That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.

Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.

You're back, boychick.

The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.

How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?

Shut up!

Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?

Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.

No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.

Really?  How?

And you were the last one to talk to him.

What'd he say to you?

It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.

Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.

Zavitz, what? You want your old job back?

I'm doing a transfer now.

I'll come straight there.

We've also been informed that the Grand Jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs.

Tell us about Rachel Banks.

Why don't you just call Brill directly.

I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.

Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.

That's who they are.

What if I find out what they're after. You know these people, I don't.

I'll pay you.

I mean did you call anyone.

What'd I tell you?

I didn't use my name.

The NSA killed him.

In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.

Gimme that.

You're driving.

We lost 'em.

Fuckin-A.

Same thing?

I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.

They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.

What if <u>what</u>?

Pretty fast.

He came in four minutes ago.

Who's calling?

FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.

I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.

With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...

Hi, Mr. Dean.

Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?

That's fine.

How 'bout Christian Dior?

Very good.

I'll be right back.

Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.

A police report.

You tell me.

Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.

We'd appreciate your cooperation.

Did he give you anything?

Was he with anyone?

Why'd you go to Harrison's?

Uh-oh.

So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?

You should take this seriously.

You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?

What do you mean?

It's not true.

I told you I didn't want you seeing her.

Oh, please--

I know.

I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.

The lingerie.

I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.

I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.

Actually, that's not true.

And then what?

How's the trout?

It is fish.

I got a call from my firm this morning saying don't come in.

There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!

This conversation's over.

What makes you think it's you?

Otherwise you may have to what?

God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening.

Robert--

Gentlemen--

Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.

Bobby--

She can't talk to you right now.

In your dreams.

Yeah.

No.

The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.

It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.

They killed Rachel.

Go to 'em, Jerry.

Yeah?

Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.

What does that have to do with you?

Well we'd sure like to help you.

Then what's your goddam opinion?

It means who's side are you on?

What about the tapes?

Who?

He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.

And they have the video. That's confirmed.

Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.

Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?

That insults them.

A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.

Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?

What's this?

You should come into the shelter.

- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.

You sew very badly.

This is - what is this?

Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.

Don't you know you drove everybody mad?

Do you promise?  I wouldn't want to die here.  I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns.  Very English.  And I know exactly where I want to be buried.  In our garden.  Where I grew up. With a view of the sea.  So promise me you'll come back for you.

Tell me about your garden.

A broken car?

Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?

I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.

Have you seen Katharine?

Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Führer!  Il Duce.

If I could just see some identification.

What did you think you were doing in his tent?

What did you do?

Which we've overflown twice.

And where are the Expedition Maps?

Why do they care about our maps?

Look, either shut up, or go home.

Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still

Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.

Or was it Toronto?

Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.

They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg inhave you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?

Supper. Hana calls after him.

Hello.

Thief, I think, is more accurate.

I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.

Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.

First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?

The team is in mourning, darling.

Oh.

Marvelous plane.  Did you look?

I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England.

Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.

And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.

What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?

He needn't disturb you.

Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?

I'm still here.

Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?

Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?

No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.

So I follow the wires?

Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.

No. But he hands them over.

I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.

And what if he really is a spy?

He's gone, hasn't he?

Hello.

Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.

I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.

I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.

What's happening?  Am I needed?

How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.

I'll come with you.

What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.

This is wonderful!

What are you talking about?

No.

You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.

Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.

A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.

That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.

You don't call, you don't write.

Don't overestimate yourself.

Where are you at least?

Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.

I have a question...

I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.

I don't want to waste your time.

Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.

Seems I am.

Are you...okay?

I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.

You're shaking. Are you nervous?

Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.

I know.

We going somewhere?

Maybe I should drive this time.

I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.

It's a test.

It's a fake.

I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.

It's one way.

We're going to die, aren't we...

What's my problem? You want a list?

Lose something?

And--

Nothing? You don't even lock the door?

And good morning.

So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.

Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.

True enough.

The Rembrandt--that was quite good.

I'll need that.

So you're testing <u>me</u> now?

Why don't we take oxygen?

Let's do it again.

Won't take any time.

You were afraid of heights?

Aren't we all.

Camera in the--

Popup, on floorboards. And--

We did it.

You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.

Your share.

I like banks.  That's where the money is.

What about the rules?

Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.

The oscilloscope's already programmed.

No way to take another day or two?

You shouldn't have.

But would you--would you--

Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.

So what are you going to do with your share?

Not for me.

MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...

He looks familiar.

They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.

We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.

It's too soon.

She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.

You'll just have to have faith.

My friend, you always surprise me.

See you.

... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --

Where've you been?

What's she doing here?

What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.

Jesus.

An on-site monitoring well?  That means --

Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea.  You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?

You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?

Oh, my God.

I can put them in a good school.

And get someone to help around the house.

Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?

I'm sorry, Erin.

Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an --

Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.

You're a girl.

How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.

That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?

Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?

I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?

Then I don't get anything either.

Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.

You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.

Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.

He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?

I was just asking.  Are you all right?

Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --

Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --

What's a demur?

Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?

So why would PG&E offer it?

Wait, what do you mean, ten years?

Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --

I don't know what to say.

How many counts?

Who's the judge?

Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.

Ross.

You're married.

You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.

So that stuff -- it kills people.

You've been reading for hours.

I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?

Annabelle Daniels.

Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.

No.

What're you doing?

I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.

If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.

I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?

I'm bored, and so are the kids.

I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?

It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.

-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.

I am not talking to you, bitch.

You know that thing it says in here about rashes?

Oh.  Oh.

Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.

Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.

Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.

You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.

Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.

Barks a blue streak.

Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.

Barks at Han.

Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...

Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.

Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?

The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.

I have felt it.

But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.

Captain Solo.  What's the situation?

Good, and Commander Skywalker?

That's right.

Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.

.... I'm afraid there's not much left.

There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.

There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.

Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.

Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.

What are you staring at?

No thanks.

Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.

That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?

That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?

Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...

No.

I'll take what's mine now.

Sorry, am I interrupting anything?

.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.

You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.

Have they analyzed the one that was killed?

Two transports at a time is awfully risky.

You rest now.

Closer?!

Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.

Jabba the Hutt?

This hyperdrive had better work.

I have followed my feelings.

I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.

Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.

Okay.  I'll give it a try.

I don't believe it.

Price?  What do you mean?

Four this time!  The Force you feel.

My mind fills with so many images.

I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.

Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?

The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.

Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.

There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!

The Hoth System?

Excuse me.  I didn't mean to disturb....  What am I saying?

In some fashion -- and I lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from Earth's future into Earth's past.

What, Lewis?

ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.

You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.

See you in hell, Snake.

Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?

Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.

Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?

You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?

Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.

Stop the damn car.

Where is it?

I don't know about this thing.

I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?

So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.

Could be a big one comin' any minute now...

Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.

Don't follow me.

Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.

The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.

I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.

Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.

Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.

You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.

But your life and lands are far from here.

Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?

Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?

Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...

I want to thank you.

It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.

It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--

Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.

Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?

With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...

I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?

But, I'm here.

--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...

He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.

It didn't hurt too much, did it?

No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week.

Why can't you be my champion?

I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.

The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.

Why?

And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?

Who?!

To me? But why?

There are things about love--

Why didn't he kill us?

I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...

They do.

You are truly magnificent!

Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.

Now you must pay me.

Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.

Well why are they tearing the building down?

How about Lankaster Merrin.

You're convinced that it's genuine.

It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.

It's-

I'm sorry.

It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.

Hello?

Here.

Just five or six people.

Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!

Oh Burke! Poor Burke!

I'm gonna miss you.

Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?

I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?

Oh, she'd love it.

Thank you.

Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?

Morning.

Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.

Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?

Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-

Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?

Are you sure?

You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?

Pretty close?

Did he tell you about my party?

Didn't tell you of what she did?

And how do you go about getting an exorcism?

Oh yeah, since when?

No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-

I don't know. I'll have to look it up.

Did you know my mother died recently?

I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It's tap water.

You've been playing with it?

Captain who?

Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.

What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?

Mr. Dennings?

Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.

Oh you did. What did you hear?

What are you doing here?

Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!

She doesn't remeber a thing.

Goodbye Father. I call you.

Where'd you get it then?

Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.

Goodnight Dims.

Another one. Had your lunch?

He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body." When the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith".

Quod nomen mihi est?

How long are you planning to stay in Regan?

No.

Have we met?

And Dennings, you read how he died?

Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.

One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?

MERRIN!!!!!!!

Yes I am her brother, he's the son

Is there someone inside you?

What's this?

Just the same.

Well, look at this.

Honey ...

Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.

I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...

My brother and I. One each.

Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.

Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.

Oh no!

That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?

Don't make trouble, all right?

You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?

Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.

What do you think?

Really.  You sleeping?

Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?

By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.

Yeah?

What're you talking about?

Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?

The hell you don't.

Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.

What was it like?

A gust of wind killed him.

Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.

What's that?

Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.

I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.

Awe inspiring.

Get out of here.

Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.

Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'

Something, huh?  All those bids.

You all right?

I thought we all had separate rooms.

She was staying at the Grand downtown ...

We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.

Unless you want the right.

Why would I mind?

What's the matter with you?

You haven't seen Susie, have you?

Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.

Funny, huh?

What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?

What're you doing down here?

Expensive hangover.

God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?

I could've.  But he didn't want me to.

Cancel, Frank.

You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?

We're not getting paid then.

What's it for?

What channels it on?

What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?

What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?

I didn't hear you come in.

Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started.

Looks like these got a few years on them.

I mean, you can play.  You're okay.

A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.

You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.

No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.

You're an hour and a half late.

How should I take it?

I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.

Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.

I sing now?

We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.

That!  You can't wear that!

A seven.

Nine!

They're tight.

Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.

Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.

He's right.

And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.

Great?

Peggy Lee?

What'd she sing?

Wow. You ever see her again?

Uh ...

Is that important?

Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.

Whatcha doin' over there?

Funny hours.

Thanks.

Right.  Bring him back.

You want to know if he's okay. Right?

Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?

No.

It went well tonight.

Is that the way it is?

Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?

Forget it.

He do that every year?

How's egghead?

If you want, I got a pack in the room.

Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.

It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.

What'd I say?

You were good.

She's four feet tall.  Ed?

Soap convention.

By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.

He had a mind that escalated things.

Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.

Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?

In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.

The recent past.

Ivory.

Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?

From Hurley's?

John.  It's good to see you.

Big piece or little?

Don't they ever let us take these boots off?

I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.

Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.

Jesus Christ, Castor.

Where am I?

I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.

Nice-looking kid.

Why would he need more?

Hey, bro ...

So?

Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.

Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.

She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."

We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.

Who is this?

Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --

How did he expect to do that?

Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?

The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.

How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?

What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --

-- Castor?

What are you going to do!

I don't know.  How long before it kills us?

Screw your boundaries, Janie.  You have something I want.

Clarissa left those here.

Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.

Kim?

You've got someone in your office.

What happened?

Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?

It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!

You merciless bastard!

I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.

I'm just having some fun.

Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.

You're the only person in this place who can see right through me.

Just following your example.

What's that?

I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?

I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.

-- Yes.

Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.

You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?

Kate Reynolds...

Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...

Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...

She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.

No...

I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.

We did one point seven million in total revenue...

And I know people.

Take you, for instance...

Mom, dont you think we need to open the presents?

Do you like kids?

Try not to be late because kids dont like to be the last one picked up.

Big Eds?  Big Eds Tires?  Why...?

Maybe theres a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.

Is it morning yet?

Im having kind of a bad day.

Trouble at work?

Hey Jack, youre all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.

I dont care if youre Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still cant park here.

Wheres my car?!  Wheres my Ferrari!?

Like I said, it's a business deal...

I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...

Yeah?  What do you need?

Miss me, Jack?

Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?

Ive got kids, Im going home...

What're you talkin' about?

What!?  Look at the ticket...!

Are we finally being honest?

Why dont you let me take this one, Kenny?

Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.

Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...

Are you okay?

You look forward to this party all year.  Whats with you today?

Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?

Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...

This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...

$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?

I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if Im lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...Im sick of it.

Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store.

Maybe I should wait...

I found it at an outlet store.  I know its a knock-off, but I think itll look great on you...

Heres the thing.  I really hadnt planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversarys good all day...

I need to tell you something.

I mean yes, I help people that need it...

I dont know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off.

Pretty incredible, isnt it?

Youre talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.

Are you out of your mind?

Dont do that...

I'm sorry...

Youre moving...

Dont get on that plane!

No...

I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...

I need you, tiger..

Not by a long shot.

He certainly has your number, Alan.

Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?

It's Christmas Eve, Jack.

Don't you have anywhere to go?

Thats totally see through...

Ill go for a cup of coffee!

I found it!

I mean...

Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.

Those yours too?

He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.

Can't do it.  I cannot do it.

This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.

The shields on the station should protect us.

What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --

Are you alright?

You got a chisel round here?

Time for <u>your</u> lesson, Vic.  Chem 101: what happens when you <u>supercool</u> hot metal...?  Ben...

What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --

Yeah, well, his eyes say different.

The machine works.  And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --

He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."

At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --

Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields.

He's not responsive --

This is wrong in so many ways.

Back it down, Johnny!

Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --

That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber.  It's muscle, tendon.  I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --

Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.

I though we went over this.

Apparently I can disappear.

Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --

You're really cramping my style here.

Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?

Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --

Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.

Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --

Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.

We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.

Not until Ben is back inside!

I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --

What are you doing?

If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --

Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.

You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.

It's just business.

Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...

What are you doing?

Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --

They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!

We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.

What are the problems in stopping the Heart?

<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.

I told you to cut down on the sugar.

Benes... What the devil happened?

But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?

If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...

Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!

Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.

Difficult? He's impossible!

Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?

Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.

Doctor...you can't mean that! Not when we've come this far. And if we give up, there'll be no way of saving Mr. Benes --

Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?

That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...

If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?

A surgeon might...

Thank you for saving my life.

Doctor, what's wrong?

But that isn't possible.

That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.

It's against my better Judgment...

If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.

Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!

The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.

Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?

Don't tell me they're refueling...

We'll never get there in time, at this rate.

How does it look, Doctor?

You said there was a quick way out!

Tell them to take us out.

Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --

Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?

Looks like the sea, at dawn.

Sabotage? I don't understand...

You have no right to blame Duval --

They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.

Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?

I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!

Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.

I can't tell you.

What'd you do that for?

What happened?

What is it, Skipper?

Yes, there is.

It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.

We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.

Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.

You, uh... I'm sorry, sir, but -

You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.

Ya find the work interesting, do ya?

Clear him off the road.

...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.

Huh?

That's right. And we need more money.

Look. I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry. The price is now the whole amount. We want the entire eighty thousand.

Yah, I got the money, but, uh -

We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!

That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.

...So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.'  And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,' And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.'

So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.

Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.

So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.

Just a general way.

Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.

First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.

Where you girls from?

Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.

No, see, I don't need a finder's fee, I need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me. I need the principal.

What's the next step here, Jerry?

Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?

Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -

... I'm sorry, sir?

Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.

Yah, real good.

Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.

But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -

Yah, so we're all set.

But the deal's already done, I already got the money -

Yah, well, they exist all right.

Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -

I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.

Well, what do ya mean?

Yah!

Yah!  I... those are in the mail.

Yah.

Yah.

Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -

Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?

Yah, pretty good.

lot. It's a limited -

No kiddin'?

- All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!

Carl somethin'?

Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.

Hiya, Lou.

I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.

Ya see something down there, Chief?

How we doin' on that vehicle?

Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?

I'll fix ya some eggs.

Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.

...I'll fix ya some eggs.

Okay, ya know. Okay.

...What can I get ya?

Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.

Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...

Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...

Better times.

Hello?

Yah?

...Hello?

Linda.

So... they didn't...

And this guy is...

Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?

Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.

Yah.

Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?

It's just the three cent.

Yah.

Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?

I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here.

And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...

That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.

After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  You can deal with anything.

Let's pretend.  You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  Fuel injectors that burn people alive.

I am Jack's Cold Sweat.

The dynamite...

It means it was homemade.

No, you can't die of insomnia.

Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."

In case we want to switch nights.

Where have you been the last few weeks?

I don't know ...

Make sure.

I think everything's okay here.

I don't know.

You hear that?

No.

Guy or girl?

The Paper Street Soap Company.

Is this a trick?

Is that what you're calling it?

I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.

You got about thirty seconds.

Marla...

My God, you're shot...

Who did this to you?

... and you come home to this.

Is this a test, sir?

You were in here last Thursday night.

I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...

We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.

Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.

This is how I met --

You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?

You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--

Why would anyone want this shitty job?

Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.

How do you feel?

But a good strange.

If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?

The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.

Unbelievable, huh?

I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?

She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.

What?

This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.

... Marla ... ?

There's fight club in Delaware City.

Hey.

Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"

Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it about you and me?

I don't know!  Nothing!

"Applicant?"

And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.

He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!

...go through with this? What are you going to do?

...to let this happen!

Fuck you.

Ask me nicely.

One minute.

Please...

What?

NO...

No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.

If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...

Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?

Appreciate something.

Look at me...

Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!

But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.

His name is Robert Paulson!

Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?

Really?

Would you rather be dead?

Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?

Yeah, how?

That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.

Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?

This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?

Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.

Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.

Um, Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I...

I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.

Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?

Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?

Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you?

Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.

What?

What's going on here?

You mean Alex Browning.

This is cheery.

But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?

For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.

When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?

And you're gonna die after me, right?

Kimberly?  It's Dad.

I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.

There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.

Is that something you're "feeling?"

He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.

How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?

Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.

Stop the car!

Can't you open the door?!

Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!

I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.

Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.

Ever do this from a jet?

Gettin' old, huh?

That's what I'm here for.

Batteries not included.

I've seen worse places.

What's that?

These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.

Snoring.  Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody talking in his sleep.  A toilet flushing.

I'm getting him out.

You never been in one of those things.

Can you handle the door gun?

Why's that?

Intelligence work.

Why'd they want us?

Thanks.

What was that?

That's an order.

Where?

He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.

Typical...

Um... actually, no.  It looks like he shot down one of their gunships...

Take your time.

Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.

So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?

You're out of your depth, Trautman. Way out.  I'm acting correctly here. Not you.  Not your gung-ho jungle ace.  It's over.  Walk away.

I hear you're not enjoying it here.

Congressional Medal of Honor.

We left some people behind there, John... POWs.

Fine.

Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.

I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.

<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?

It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...

I'm sorry.

... So... where did you sleep last night?

... You have a little... uh... something on your face...

He's not a moron.

Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.

... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...

Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?

So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?

Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?

Come on now...You can't sit here.

About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?

... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?

A list.

Now what?

Oh, Lydia!

This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.

No... thanks... Listen --

Hi... Where are my shoes?

<u>What</u>?!

Do you know what the Little People just told me?

... Do you know who I am?

A quest?

Him...?

I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...

I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...

"Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee"....

What's her name?

That's O.K.

I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!

Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.

Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.

YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!

Are there any questions?

I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.

I advise you to let us go.

Tell me more. I want to know everything.

Don't say that.

Well, it's enough for me.

See, I told you it was him...  Your name's Donnie something, right?

Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.

Now, now.

I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.

I'll be gone two or three weeks.

Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?

You're depressed that I come along.

Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!

No substitutions.

No. We have tomatoes.

Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.

I don't make the rules.

Wasn't it, ladies?

Sorry.

Robert...

Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.

Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...

It's not that bad.

Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...

Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?

Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?

It's none of your business!

You're leaving?

But what about me?

Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?

If you're free.

You don't call that music, though.

What?

Catherine...

No, it isn't what I think.

Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...

It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?

No inner feeling.

I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...

Where are you going?

I have to talk to you.

No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...

What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...

Mass production is what does it.

Yeah, it could be adorable...

Pardon me?

That's exactly what I am doing, again.

I told you, no. I'm not that type.

Do you have a name?

So watcha doin'?

Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?

Whadja wanna see me about?

So wadda you do with your girls?

That's it?

I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?

See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.

Why don't you ask Eddie?

Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.

What are you going that way for?

Where you goin'?

I gotta go take a piss.

Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?

I think by Twenty-two.

I think he's 18 or 17.

Like this?

You here to see somebody?

What she look like?

How do I know you're not lying.

Would you like me to change anything?

What?

Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?

For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...

Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?

Greetings, everyone.

This one's going to be even more fun.

I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.

Really. The California Racquet Club?

Two bs?

No children?

Mrs. Smith.

Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?

So what do you figure?

No idea at all?

Like when?

The two surfer boys?

Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.

I guess not.

I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.

Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?

Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.

I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.

You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.

Wouldn't they normally be locked?

I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.

Shoot.

Did you hear something?

Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did ---

My hero.

Cute young thing, too.

Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?

Why do you keep doing this?

Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.

If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.

Uh... I'm just out of the shower.

I mean put clothes on.

'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'

'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'

Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?

What about his parents?

What are you talking about?

Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?

Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...

No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...

What are you talking about?

What's wrong, Gail?

Oh God, I hate things that start like that....

What is this....

And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.

I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'

Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?

Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.

No wonder.

Where is she?

Just give me a hint, all right?

It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.

I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.

Not really.

Yes?

I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?

Now that we've broken the ice...

No thanks.  I carry my own.

Actually, you may take it all now.

My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.

They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.

Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?

You're saying you need money.

You going to be okay?

And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.

Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.

You okay?

Ah, an obvious choice.

I came to warn you...

Got those Vomit invites here...

Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?

You okay?

Let's get serious...

You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?

My axe!

This is boring, guys.

I'm afraid so, you want her?

Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.

You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...

Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!

When you going to let me work with you?  Why you always fucking with me?

It's me.

I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?

You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...

What are you running from?

'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'

Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.

You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!

The point?

It doesn't have to be like this?

Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...

You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?

So...

I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.

Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?

What about you?  Can you stand a toss?

How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.

Got a wife named Angie.

Who knows?

Man, I'm clean.

Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.

Oh Alain!  C'est merveilleux!  Tu me gâtes.  Je t'aime.  Attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai acheté.

Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!

Sale boulot.

I don't know.  Boca is scared. He's not strong enough.  He sees policemen in his soup.

It's beautiful.

Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another.  He's in shipping.

Where's he from?

What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?

I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."

Who stuck up the laundromat?

Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?

No, you?

The greaser with the blonde.

If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.

Toy wit' this will ya.

Pass.

It was a crematorium.

What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.

So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?

They around?

You're shitting me!

We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.

Hey, bud.

How about a little of the King?

Damn.

What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?

Butch called.

Where's Johnny?

I love you, Bud.

I'm off.

Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!

Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.

What is going on here, Satch?  What are those guys doing out there?

No, I don't.

About what?

What do you mean?

415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.

Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.

Uh, hello?

Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?

Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.

What?

The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.

You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?

What the hell...

How could this be happening?

We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.

Thirty-five?  That would make it...

What?

Are you alright"?

Whatta you mean she's not here?

When?

What do I tell them?

Got it.

Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.

We got him!  Dad you got him!

Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.

Dad, what the hell is going on?

My father didn't die in a fire?

I better give you my address then.

This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it...

She makes ten.

Which means he probably knew her.

What?

I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.

Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?

You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.

Are you a good cop, John?

The 2-3.  Homicide.

No more... I can't!

You're all just jealous.

What was that?

We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.

What're you doing?

How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?

Think you can figure it out?

That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?

I'm a slow eater.

I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?

What's the matter?!

Which one is it?

What are they saying?

What's this?

You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.

I don't know.

Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.

No.  I got here just before you did.

Could we move a little faster?

What d'ya got in there?

Please... be cool.

This is no time to celebrate!

Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.

I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.

What?

Yeah... We're gonna scare him.

Oh, jeez.

It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.

....with a woman's touch.

Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!

You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.

It's all over.

Okay, give it back.

Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?

They did show up.  Isn't that great?

You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.

But what if they try and scare us?

Okay, okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.

Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?

What's goin' on?

Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?

...but there just may not be enough time.  If you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better between you two...we should talk.

You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...

Look --

Look, I don't want your money!

What do you want?

Everything going okay?

Maybe you should be moving on.

You're talking about my lady.

Tell me.

Does he know about what happened?

Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...

What do you mean you've never made a prank call?

That's disgusting.

I guess not.

A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...

Tell me.

Did you hear that?

Where's the radio?

Christ...where's Rennie??

Where did you get that alcohol?

I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.

I thought I told you to stay away from her.

But that doesn't prove that he's the one!

Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.

Can't we at least talk about it?

Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.

Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.

I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.

Can he really take us home?

Rennie...??

You have to call the police...

I used to drive a taxi.

Guys ready to order?

Elliot?

A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.

How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.

You mean because What's-His-Name.

Is it safe?

We're making too much of this.

He'll hate it.

What?

Shoot him.

Great game.

This could be it.

Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.

Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.

Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.

What?

You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.

I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.

Because we're completely mismatched.

I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?

It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.

I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?

Will I believe you when you tell me something?

What else?

Am I really so deeply repugnant?

See, Daddy.

What else?

See, Daddy.

I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.

I'll have whatever she's having.

The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.

And you've been extremely patient.

You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.

Great game. Red Sox are winning.

All the failures, all the fatalism.

It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.

It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.

We must have been heroic.

I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.

I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.

What do you want me to do?

Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.

It's a complicated subject.

I don't know.

If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.

They're my team.

And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?

Yes.

You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.

What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?

Yes.

This could be it.

You've worked with Elliot?

Oh. You know him.

Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.

Is it true?

He wears a disguise.

But you're his friend.

He's a very sweet man.

Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.

Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.

"Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."

"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."

"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?

You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.

Just an admirer...

I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.

You're a clergyman.

Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.

What was he like?

I'll take your luggage back, baas.

I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!

Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community.  You belong to a very important profession.

Is it over if they arrest you now?

Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.

In England, I was a poor student but I --

Perhaps some tea?

Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!

So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.

I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.

Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...

According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.

--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?

You know their workforce.  Two-thirds at least fall into the category.  We'll be closing down their operation for days.  At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.

That's the last.

Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.

That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.

German.

You really need that much?

It's all right.

How was your evening?

Where are we going?

How the hell did you get here.

He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.

Not that.

So we don't know for sure about you, either.

What happened?

The doctor will give you something.

The name?  For the certificate.

You gotta be kidding.

Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...

I'll take care of my end.

Three... Rudy got ambitious.

What do you add up to here?

The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.

You okay?

Where did you get those?

Where did you get them developed?

How does it taste?

I guess I'm kind of...

It's just been a while.

How was it?

Why are you laughing?

... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...

It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.

They checked in.

Why?

Do you trust him?

Yeah.

If you don't start telling the truth... 

A man helped me open it...

There better be a guy with the

You've got it all figured.

There may be a hunting party.

That would be the first time.

Only one car.

Okay?

I want to say something.

Okay.

I don't know.

Are we going to make it?

What now?

Where's home?

No, I'm not.

You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?

Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.

Hope you get to where you're going.

One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?

All right. Shells?

Gonna knock down a wall?

You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.

Suit yourself.

I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...

My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.

Where we go in1?

Let's just get to the border.

Don't you want to go to the airport?

Listen... how much money did you make this year?

You're going to have to walk back to the border.

Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.

I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.

You can trust him...

The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.

I've got to stop.

You can't get away from me, Albert.

No choice. I had a visit from somebody.

Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?

What did he say?

Well, he drove it into the river.

What about the brakes?

How'd it happen, then?

Bloody well tell me who sent you.

You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.

Confidential, like.

I've been asked to make sure you don't.

Address?

I want to talk to you later.

What was bugging Frank?

I know him too.

We went about together.

You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?

You sure about that?

Who set it up?  Eric?

And you didn't know her last name?

Have another?

Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.

Thanks for coming.

Oh, what you doing now?

Where's that?

Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.

I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?

And what you going to do?

Thorpey nearly died laughing.

Do us a favour?

No chance of that.

Meaning what?

Well, well. Small world, isn't it?

Oh, you've been watching television.

Scotch, please.

Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.

Bollock naked with his socks still on?

Not suede boots!

How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.

Polacks and deadbeats.

You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.

To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.

You did?

You had one you'd know it.  Patel. They keep coming up.  I don't know. They like to talk to salesmen.  They're lonely, something.  They like to feel superior, I don't know.  Never bought a fucking thing. You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho this, the blah blah blah," "The Mountain View--" "Oh yes.  My brother told me that..." They got a grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George. Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of which I want to tell you something:  I never got a cup of tea with them. You see them in the restaurants.  A supercilious race.  What is this look on their face all the time?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Their broads all look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like it. Christ...

We're stuck with this...

It's too...

I...

It's not.

That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"

You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.

What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...

Starting up.

Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?

He made up those rules, and we're working for him.

They have...

Yes.

What could somebody get for them?

How many leads have we got?

How do you know he'd buy them?

We're just "talking" about it.

You're going to steal the leads?

Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.

That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.

You...

It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."

What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...

I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...

Yeah.

A waste of time?  Why?

The cops?

You have nothing to hide.

Yeah.  You know who doesn't?

Thieves.

Wh...wh...Wha...?

What?

Shelly: get in the office.

Mmm.

Excuse me, fella.

You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?

Shelly...

Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...

Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?

Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.

Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.

Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?

I will close.

No.

Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.

That's alright.

What happened?

Ah, fuck.  Leads!  Leads! Williamson!  Send me out!  Send me out!

Get 'em to me!

Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?

What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.

If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.

I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.

Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.

What?

I...

Don't.

You did that?

Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...

Shit.

Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...

Eight units?

When?

Fuck her...

...yes...

You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."

I own the property, my mother owns the property, I put her into it. I'm going to show you on the plats. You look when you get home A-3 through A-14 and 26 through 30. You take your time and if you still feel.

You're sure?

What?

Rick...?

Rick...

Yeah.

I've got to talk to you.

I've got to talk to you...

Who did she call?

What was yesterday?

Today.  Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.

She wants her money back.

No, Jim.

I'm...

What...?

The deal.

What?  What?  What, Jim: I tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink.

Your farewell to the troops?

They got, listen to me...

Listen to me: They got some of them.

You closed him yesterday.

Where are you going?

Aren't you going out today?

...you want to go out today...?

Patel?  Ravidam Patel?  How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs?  Where did you get this, from the morgue?

What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...

...Mr. Williamson...

Are you alright?

Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;

But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.

Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars?  I think he would.

Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.

We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.

Then why do you come to me?

Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.

Goddamn bitch.

Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?

Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.

He is weak.

You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.

My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.

No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.

Count on me; that's my specialty.

Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time.

You?  What do you mean you, I thought...

&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...

He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.

The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.

What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.

If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.

She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.

I asked about Fredo?

I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.

They can come in now.

What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!

I want it met.

I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?

We've never sent this much with one courier.

...and the tape will be running.

What the hell are you talking about?

There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.

Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.

Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.

I'm going to the market.

Whose orders are these?

I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.

I had no idea...

His brother came to help him.

On a plane back to Sicily.

That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.

We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.

How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me?  You understand, it's an impossibility.  I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you.  I know you.  You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.

I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.

Are you Klingman?

Where can we talk?

You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.

There are still things I have to do.

What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  It was my understanding we left all that behind.  But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.

It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.

Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?

The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.

They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.

I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?

Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?

Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?

Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.

I know.

Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.

Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.

The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami.

How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.

Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.

I want you to help me take my revenge.

I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.

Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?

Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.

Rosato, where's your brother?

I have already rented the apartment to another family.

Fuck you.

You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.

I've gotten to know someone who's famous.

No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.

Sure.  I loved it.

The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.

Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.

I'm not married.

He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.

Good morning.

Or would you prefer a beer?

They're just copies then.  Gotcha.

When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.

To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?

You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.

I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.

Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.

"Bride of Frankenstein."

Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks.

I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.

No, you were middle class, like all Americans.

You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.

How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.

Do you mind?

It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.

Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion?

Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?

You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.

After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?

I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work.

It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.

If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.

Good afternoon, Clayton.

I suppose you'd like the top down.

Is that really her?

Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?

It's not like her.

Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?

I'd like to try again.  If you're game.

I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.

Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.

No.  It won't do.

I don't know.

All right.  Let's take it off now.

Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far.

Look, if you want to die do it yourself!

Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.

You coming, Boone?

Go home, Clay.  We're closing up.

Then take the pills.

You remember how a production eats up one's life.

Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?

I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.

We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.

Mr. Kay, sir.

He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.

She is horrible.

Does the yardman come today?

Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors.  I can't believe I'm meeting you.

That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."

Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?

I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.

Too warm for a sweater, anyway.

Can we talk about the horror movies now?

My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.

Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?

You didn't?

I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.

How are you?

Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?

How's the leg?

What about?

A boost. A big boost ...

Who was the job for?

What's with the fish thing -- ?

Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce

I think about that night a lot...

Yeah -- ?

Jesus, man ... What'd you do?

Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?

It's about my brother ... Kip...

My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...

I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...

I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...

This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?

Get out of here, Ray --

Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...

You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...

Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...

They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...

You want to come along quiet?

You have my word...

I know you.

You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?

Not my girl anymore

I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...

How'd it go?

I guess ...

Got it ...

Diane 1.

Yeah.

What's the matter?

Lookit Kip. All grown up...

What about him?

For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...

All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?

Forget that ...

A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..

Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.

Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...

What does that mean -- ?

oh.

Breakfast brunch -- ?

We'll take it...

Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.

No...

You okay -- ?

You?

You don't think so, huh?

You hear me?

You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...

After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...

Too early to tell. Nervous?

What did I tell you? What? What did I tell you?

You boost her -- ?

Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...

Now what -- ?

Shit ...

He give you an advance -- ?

Buy you a drink?

"Mitch?"

What the hell are you doing -- ?

They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...

She's trouble --

That's what I want ...

Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.

No ... ?

Ready -- ?

Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?

Stop. What about Maserati Boy?

I pop your hood; find your siren wires

Hear you roar ...

You okay -- ?

Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell?  And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?

You think it can be done?

Okay, then... Otto?

This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.

What do you want, shithead?

But he was always a bad kid, that one.

Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.

I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?

You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?

I warned you a million times.

Take it easy.  We can talk about it.

What're you doing? What about the car?

What do you do?

My bag. My bag.

It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.

Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?

Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.

Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.

Then you're safer in here.

What are you talking about?

They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.

What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.

Keep 'em coming.

we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.

I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.

I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.

It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.

Where'd you find such creeps?

You ready?

Do you realize what we're involved in here now?

Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.

Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.

I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...

The third store down.

He didn't call?

You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.

No way! You're kiddin'!

--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.

I've been shit faced for like two weeks.

What'd you get? You get leniency?

Thanks, Chuck.

What?

Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.

You and Morgan throw?

Why didn't you yoke him?

Oh...

Okay.

I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?

Did she get my Double Burger?

Come on, Will...

My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.

Did your Uncle get arrested?

I'm not sure--

You want us to give you cash right now?

How'd you like that course?

Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?

Where is it touching you?

Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?

Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.

This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--

--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--

Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--

Well, I'm sorry.

Will.

Thank you.

Yes.

I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.

And he mailed it to Hardy--

Why would he do that?

Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?

Seems like it's going well.

--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--

Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.

--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.

Who is he?

What should I do?

What happened?  You got fired, huh?

There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." We should'a kicked that dude's ass.

Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?

That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.

Well, I can see this is pointless...

Yeah, I read those.

"A History of the United States, Volume I." If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States." That book will knock you on your ass.

What is?

No.

How'd it go?

Well, are you going out again?

Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.

So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?

They could see that I meant it.

What did you think?

Do you think you're alone?

Do you have a soul-mate?

Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.

But you can't give back to them, Will.

Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.

I know.

Which one did you take, Will?

That's what you want?

No. Thank you.

Have you ever seen Annie Hall?

You grew up around here?

You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.

I thought you said you'd show me your place.

How's it goin'?

Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.

Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?

I want you to come with me.

Yeah, I'm sure.

Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.

I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.

Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?

Take care.

'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?

Will ya look at her!

Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--

Ready, Pa?

Twenty days work, oh boy!

Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'.

I'd come back--

Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.

Maybe the road's out.

You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?

Want to work?

Can all of you work?

Open up! We hear you got a riot.

That's the way it is.

They don't get in here. Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights.

We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.

Government.

Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.

But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.

Been out travelin' around?

Is it fur?

They're all gone--or dead.

This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?

This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?

She's settlin'.

I ain't no more a preacher, you know.

How about us? Is that the truth for us?

What's the matter?

You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?

How about a lift, mister?

Been doin' a job?

I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.

You ain't got to get sore.

An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.

Yes, ma'am.

What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.

You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!

What's the matter, Grampa?

Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.

Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?

I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.

Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.

Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.

Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?

You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.

Jus' sassy, that's all.

Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.

That!

Got any more, Ma?

You be careful, Tommy. Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything.

Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.

It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.

You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.

Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...

Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by. 

Sure. Good-by.

This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.

You can have this for ten cents.

What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.

How you get all this money?

I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.

Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.

Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.

Can you pick peaches?

Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.

Oh... really?

--No.

Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.

Bob...

Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...

What am I gonna do?

Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.

Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.

Yes.

Hello...?

You look beautiful.

Shoulda brought my gun.

Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.

I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.

Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.

You went to school with these people.

I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.

How was your day, today, sir?

Like a union?

Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.

It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.

Have you seen Debi Newberry?

The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.

Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --

Wait a minute--

Did you see Blank in there?

...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.

Throw that away.

They were very upset.

This is not good.

What's it look like?

He sells BMW's?

How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?

What the hell happened to you?

It didn't work out.

When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.

I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.

Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...

Doesn't matter.

You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.

Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?

Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.

I have a way with animals.

Are you shy, Mr. Booker?

Son?

You missed a button.

I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.

I don't know any other way, Annie.

Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --

Why don't you go lie down?

You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.

Yeah?

What?

Oh. You didn't tell me.

It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.

Did he mention it?

I'll come.

Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.

Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?

Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...

What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?

Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.

Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.

So, what, uh, what train are you taking?

Okay. You want me to pick you up?

What about Grace?

I should go get some of her things.

"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...

Did you get a hold of that horse guy?

What was I saying?

What... Bo-... What about the magazine?

Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...

Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.

I miss you, Annie.

Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.

Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.

Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.

I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...

Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.

Where to?

Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?

Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?

How's Peterson's holding up for you?

Where does this go, Diane?

Thank you. You're all doing too much.

You and Frank ever take a vacation?

Sounds like something Tom would say.

Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.

Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?

- See, what you can do for him --...

They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.

Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?

When you figure on branding?

Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.

Tom?

Of course I have.

She gonna be long?

Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.

Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.

Grace, I need you to come with me.

My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.

Honey, you all right? Did something fall?

What, sweetheart?

You shut up, stupid!

Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.

Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.

Hey, darlin'.

If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.

Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.

Does a horse miss a saddle?

Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.

Welcome to our show!

I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry.

Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?

Ta-da!

Oh wow, we are fried.

Who's that?

Dead.

Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.

Dade?

What did we learn in school today?

Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.

Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.

Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!

This isn't a virus. It's a worm!

Oh, shit! He got me.

Yes!

What the hell is going on?

And if I win?

And you have to smile.

Thank you.

It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.

Dade.

You look good in a dress.

Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.

Uhhhmm...

Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.

It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.

Hello?

Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.

What? whatwhatwhat?

Yo, what's up?

Precisely what you're paid to prevent.

The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.

So what are we supposed to do?

What the hell was that all about?

What?

But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?

Murphy kid turn you down?

They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?

Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!

I'll take you down there.

What?

Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit

Just leave me alone and lets forget it.

I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.

No, no, we have to get out of here right now.

Brady!

Mom, please

We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.

Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  Hello?

Found it.

Because the lights are all out.

Why shouldn't I?

Yes.

Night Doc.

What the hell did this?

What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?

Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.

Jamie, sometimes it's...

Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.

Come on Rachel.

I thought you said you were ready.

Can we go home soon Rachel?

Rachel!

That's all the windows, Dad.

He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.

You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.

I know! Don't you want to talk to him?

You won't look pushy.

You won't come on too strong.

Leave Myers for the state boys.

Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.

132 to 133 this is 134.

I am. Ben Meeker.

That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.

Its true, Sheriff.

When he makes that call.

Something?

Where's that Deputy?

How far are you going, Mr. Sayer?

Sort of.

I know that Mr. Sayer.

Okay.

Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.

What time?

Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.

I've already lost it.

Sure, see you later.

You still spooked?

What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?

Fancy.

Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.

Get him out of here!

I don't want to.

That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...

Is that all you say?

My parents won't be back till ten.

Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.

They could be.

I thought you were babysitting tonight.

Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.

Is Annie around?

Okay. Later.

Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?

Can we watch the monster movies?

I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.

'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...

I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.

There WAS.

Right.

There's nothing else I can do.

Thorazin.

If you say so.

I couldn't if I tried.

...because there are no interesting single men at this party!

Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.

I love that.  That's my type.

And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.

You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them.  I get the feeling you tune in to your environment.

Uh, who gets dropped first?

Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.

Oh, geez, yeah.

Well, I live downtown.

But I'm seeing him.

Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.

Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.

I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.

Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.

Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.

We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...

Yeah.

Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...

Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?

Now I ca-can't remember.

Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?

You've had some dizzy spells.  What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?

Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing.

Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.

...with the affiliates.

Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?

Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.

Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?

Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.

Yeah, you would.

I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.

He's got like six gold records.

Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.

I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.

Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.

I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.

This is not an easy situation.

It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.

But it hasn't been forever. 

Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.

Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?

Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?

I want one with you.

I am... I did slave all day.

I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...

Don't make it worse, Dad.

I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.

Want some coffee or tea?

God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.

Me?

I don't sell my work by the yard!

Like what?

Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.

In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?

Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!

Well, he has to rule out certain things. 

Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.

Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.

Yes!

Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?

Oh, yeah?

I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...

Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.

Glad you could put in an appearance.

Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.

You've always had good taste in husbands, so...

No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.

Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?

Doesn't she look great in that new dress?

Not this Thanksgiving, you know.

You found all this, all this out on one date?

Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?

Boy--

Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...

Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.

You're too demanding.

What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?

Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."

Well, why don't you share them with us?

That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.

Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...

Come on, Mickey.  Come on.

I was so bored!

At least I'm open to new concepts!

Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.

God!

Good.  How are you?

It was a terrible evening.

People change...you know.

Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?

Have you?

Nobody ever said it.

No, I haven't.

I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...

Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...

That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.

Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?

When'd you get here?

Mickey?

Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.

Well, okay.  Thank you very much.

Aren't you glad to see me?

You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...

...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..

You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?

What have they got you doing?

That would adversely impact my income.

We could skip the Gavotte.

...aren't you afraid of me...?

...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?

And why is it a vacant exercise?

No, you're wrong about Verger.

You want to get married...?

Hard up as you are, at your age?  Whadda <u>you</u> care?  Surrender.

That's right.

Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...

Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.

What else did I miss...?

Hold up a minute...

The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.

If you would see him monument, look around you.

What do you want me to do?

..It won't be long now, sir...

He don't like popcorn.

You give me whatever I want...?

And how would you know that?

No, no, of course not.

...here's to child abuse!

..suitcase...locker...

Yes sir, I saw it. 

I am all attention.

I know you did what you could.

Just a moment.  Starling didn't...

She threw a punch at a man on the team.

....I didn't realize I said it out loud.

What'd you say, hon...?

Waal...

I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.

I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...

I require...

...Franklin.

She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?

Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.

And you let her get away.

And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?

I came to pay my...

I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...

...I'm sorry....?

Thank you, Cordell.

...might I make a suggestion...?

You want another drink, honey...?

What's that, Baby?

...what...?

Give me your gun...

...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...

Ask me when we get home.

...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...

But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.

...what a lovely perfume.

Speaking of the Vacant Post.

..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?

...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...

Yes.

...yes...?

Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.

And all he <u>left</u> us:  the Country brought back his <u>hat</u>, and his <u>badge</u>... both with a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he left us.  That's what I said.

Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...

Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.

Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.

My encounter.

It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.

You think you're so...but you're just...

You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...

Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.

Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said...

I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?

Eavesdropping, eh?  Hear anything good?

Man, she's losing it...

Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?

I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.

Are we allowed to start hating "Wendy" yet..."Gee Wichita, I guess mosquitoes have always liked me."

You'll be hiding behind a tree.

I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.

One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.

You look a like you could use a friend.  You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...

Who wants to go tell the Anti-christ to take a "time-out?"

"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?

Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.

We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...

We have more in common than you think, Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It's important. Between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn Internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. Out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who I once was...I get recharged. Now who's the dork?

Do you really not believe in God?

Excuse me, Counselor Wendy, I need assistance in finding that important...thingie in the storage room.

Do you really think we're fooling anyone?

Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...

Something more interesting than that...How could you?  How could--!

God, you're beautiful.

I'm still on anti-biotics, I really                         ] shouldn't be caffeining...Gosh, I've had a lot of daydreams about losing my virginity. Never one like this. For one, I wasn't a mutant. Secondly, I...What are you thinking?

I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.

Don't say that.

I don't believe it. I'm winning.

Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.

So, are you a cheerleader?

Gee, thanks.

Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?

If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent.

Oh, I have to hear this.

I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.

If you're going to openly be a bitch....

Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.

Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.

God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.

Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.

What do you want from me?

TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!

Maybe you should see a doctor.

Don't worry. We'll work something out.

Guess who?

I said I was sorry.

It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?

Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?

Veronica, you look like hell.

God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?

That was seriously warped, Veronica.

Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.

Shit.

You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.

Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.

You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?

I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.

No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.

And your worst enemy.

"You might think what I've done is shocking..."

So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!

We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.

It doesn't work on small animals!

Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?

You're still not listening! I'm not..

This knife is filthy.

I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!

Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.

You know what I want, babe?

We on tonight man?

Any contestants worth mentioning?

The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.

I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.

I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.

wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.

Hello!

Come on, sit up.

If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?

Can I go now?

Who cares!

You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.

I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!

You have it.

I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.

is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.

Mummy!

Him.

That.

I shall call him Diello.

John has fallen in love with me!

How do you know? Did he tell you?

Let's go overseas . . .

Mummy!

I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .

Bye, Dad.

Are you a dream too?

What's happening to me? What are you doing?

Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?

Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?

If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.

You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.

Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.

Sure plenty of times.

I understand... I won't-

Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!

Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.

Since what?

I have my connections

So you're just packing it up just like that?

Yeah? You and who else?

Hello I'm Dr...

What did you just say?

No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.

As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?

Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.

You're alive...

It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.

I thought you loved games.

You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?

Morgue...?

Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.

What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?

How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?

Dreams?

Hey. Can I borrow something?

You got a drinking problem or what?

Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!

Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.

I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.

That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.

I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...

And she thinks you're blackmailing me?

Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John.

Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...

Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...

Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?

Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.

Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.

What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?

That's what I'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind.  Just lemme talk to Joey to... to apologize.

"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...

I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...

Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?

This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?

Here.  Get off here.

Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...

Uh, er... I...

Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...

Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...

I... no... I don't have the right... I...

You were... very... inspiring.

I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.

We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.

Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...

This guy LaPlante won an award?

It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"

You just can't bear the idea of good news.

That too.

There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?

If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...

"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?

I didn't ask him.

Excuse me, Ms. Gayley.  That guy Inspector Dayton... he's recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants...

Safety?

Was that your dad?

Wife, girlfriend or mother?

How's the new place?

All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.

Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.

Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.

I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.

Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.

Well, can I make an appointment?

Do you have a family?

You must value your independence.

It's nice that you can make that choice.

Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.

I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.

Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.

I found a cent!

Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.

So you don't have anything concrete?

Have you just plain asked him?

And?

I could take a cab on the way home.

They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.

And it's a shorter commute.

How was your lunch with Charlie?

Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!

Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.

I thought we'd be happy here.

The cab's waiting!

I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.

He wants to see me!

What -- what are you doing?

What?

You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.

All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.

And this -- is the master bedroom.

What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?

Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?

Lieutenant Bedsoe?

A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.

For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.

Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.

Yes -- I think it is.

I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?

I'm leaving.

Thank you, Thomas.

That is a thought that doesn't please me.

I'll go first.

Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.

Agreed.

How comes it your are not afraid?

Why?

I was wondering if I could talk to you?

You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.

Why?

Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--

We're holding the workers down below.

It has to be.

You stayed here again last night?

It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?

The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.

Would you care for some water, Conner?

Don't cry, wee one.  It's a better place I go to.

What are you doing?

I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.

I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--

Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.

Dear, sweet, Rachel.  Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.

Would you like to deposit this in your account?

Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.

The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.

I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.

Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.

What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?

Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!

That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!

Jesus.  What is this?

There is no way out.

We're cool.

Dennis?  I want you to release those people.

Talley?

Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret?

That you, Talley?

You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?

You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?

Give up.

That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.

What the fuck is that?

Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.

You have his address?

He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.

What do you want?

Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.

They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.

I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk!

The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.

Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can.

Please get away from me.

I can't go without Thomas.

Smith!  Wake up!

Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.

Louise?

I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?

If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.

You want me to stick around, I could --

I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --

Is my daddy okay?

I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.

Are the disks still in your room?

Where are my children?

I don't know what you're talking about.

Did you find the disks?

That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.

<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!

I guess we each have something the other wants.

No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.

What is this about?

They are all Tutsi cockroaches.

Ten thousand francs for each one.

You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.

Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.

No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.

The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us. What do you think would have happened? No different.

He did.

Where are my supplies?

We must go to the Diplomat.

Your police are at the gate?

You know what the Scottish call it?

Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?

I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.

Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.

Very good.

) You cannot kill them all.

Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?

Satellite feed.

Here, have a sandwich.

There are no more rooms.

Mr. Manager.

I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.

You are the manager?

Excuse me.

How much?

Was there blood?

I'm going to put you on the third floor.

They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.

Your brother's here?

The president has been murdered.

Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.

Has Roger spoken yet?

This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.

You could leave, Paul.

Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.

Go to the roof now.

Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.

I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?

Yes, when you worked as the nurse.

A car.

What does it matter.

Please, please try one more time.

I have to stay.

I love you. Keep the children safe.

We are almost out of water.

The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.

I managed to get the President of France on the phone.

That is why they call it coach?

Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?

What do we do with all these people?

I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?

There are soldiers.

I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.

Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.

"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --

-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --

-- bullshit --

If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?

Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --

Don't think it'll be a problem.

What are you playing here, Price?

There must be some other way out.

What?

I'm sorry --

If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.

Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.

Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?

Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!

Pritchett!

Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.

And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.

Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.

What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?

-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --

I think we should have taken a right back there.

What are you looking for?

Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!

Or an on-line computer.

Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.

I knew this whole place'd be pure gold! Pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! If I can get something bizarre enough on tape, I think I can parlay it into getting me some kind'a Robert Stack "Unsolved Most- Wacked-Out Home Videos" gig. No more five afternoons a week of sex-change- Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em.

Don't touch me!

I'm not laughing, Steven.

It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.

You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!

-- just not always in the sexual sense.

-- and who's next on your list?

They weren't loaded when I put them in there!

Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?

Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?

I think...I may have the answer.

Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.

-- the window and door grates --

Please! I need your help.

Wish I could take the credit, but --

Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?

Oh, no.

Won't do any good.

Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.

Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?

And you think it's in there?

Pritchett: what is going on?

Please.....anyone....help me?

I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.

It looks delicious...

Don't play games with me, little girl.

Are we leaving mommy?

Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -

She says she's lonely...

Why?

Are we going back to California daddy?

Good night Angel...

What will Aubrey think?

Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.

It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?

Maura!

Are you all right?

Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.

Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.

Maura.

I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.

Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you.

Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.

We'll never know for sure.

Keep talking!

Where did you find this?

Right.  Like last night's doozie.

Hello?

Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.

Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?

No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.

Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.

Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...

It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.

Thank you.

Yes really.

What ... What ... ?

Yes.

Joey?

Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?

That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.

That was beautiful.

The security's actually not that severe.

That's your definition of "Hard?"

So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?

Hmmmm.....

This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...

"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."

The song's over!  Come on! "You could be swinging on a star."

Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.

No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?

"We all had our quarrels and parted..."

Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?

Did he mention the Mayflowers?

I'm going to find out.

Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.

Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?

The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.

You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.

And I'll bring my entourage...

This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...

tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.

Catholic girls are scary...

For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.

I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...

Where did you get this?

Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...

What's your favorite sport, Hawk?

Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.

We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.

So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.

Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.

You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...

Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.

Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.

Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.

Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...

If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....

Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.

No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?

Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.

Why does this have to be so hard...

Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?

Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?

...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.

Confused?

Oh, is that it!

Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.

...Certain people are --

Oh yes! In Muncie!

...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?

They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --

Your i --

...You son of a --

...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!

Hey! Where's that martini?!

Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!

I filed it yesterday.

I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.

I got big ideas, though!

What the heck's she doin', Lou?

...say, the hula hoop such a success.

Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!

I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!

I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...

You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.

...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --

You're fired.

My God! The Bumstead contracts!!

...He's not noticing, Benny.

Hello, Niagara.

Maybe he's wise.

She isn't!

But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.

At the Houmfort.

Does she suffer?

Where were you trained?

That will mean another interview, won't it?

The West Indies?

Yes, the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.

Where do you think you're going?

What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?

Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --

Don't let it bother you so, Wes.

I wish I hadn't heard --

Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?

Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?

She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...

It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.

Can't I take it for you?

You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?

Well?

You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.

Wesley!

All that you say comes down to the same thing.  You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own wife.

Investigation of what?

In other words, I'm on trial.

Well, Jeffries, why come to us about it?  Why don't you go up to the Houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that's what causes all the trouble.

Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.

Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?

Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?

OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?

Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --

You're staring at me.

What do you think?

What?

Don't start.

Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.

This just isn't the best moment for this.

Damn it, Ben --

Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.

Dad stop it!

... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --

What the hell are you kids doing down here?

Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.

He's probably been waiting all night at the station.

We don't have to always go to your club, dad.

It's what?

Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.

You want coffee or something?

Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--

That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.

Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.

I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.

Oh.

I used to know how to cook.

Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?

You're here... I'm a bit surprised.

What?

Huh?

Jesus, Jim!

Truly? Do speak.

Why are you so good at math but not in English?

Want some gum?

I don't ever want to see you.

You have to follow me?

See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?

You're parents at that party?

Hello, Charles.

It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.

Is this Charles?

Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?

Right.

Hey Wendy.

Well, you can...

All my model planes.

Yeah.

He's dead.

Good.

Nice kid.

I have to get back.

I want you to check this out, Ellie.

Who's that?

How much closer would you say you were?

Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her things are in the house.

That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.

No.

What are you doing here?

He's just rattling your cage.

One word to I.A. and he walks.

I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.

One of your cases?

"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?

I don't know what you're fucking talking about.

I don't know.

I was her best friend.

She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!

Oh?

Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.

Don't you pull that shit with me.

You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.

But why?

So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?

But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.

You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.

And the vampires of the Theatre?

Not without Claudia. Where is she?

I couldn't prevent it.

Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?

And if I cut my hair again?

How did you learn to write, Claudia?

Louis, look at me.

Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -

How do I look?

You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?

They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.

Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.

You know her?

But this can't be real. This is nonsense.

They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.

I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!

Do you think I would let them harm you?

He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.

Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now even.

They would have killed you -

Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.

Did I hear a yes?

Come, you're going to feed now.

You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.

Have you ever been caught?

The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.

You fool, what have you done?

Lestat - finish this -

Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.

She's here, your wounded one.

I didn't want to kill her.

It's only a siren...

I have to go now Lestat...

You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...

You said the slave had a crucifix...

What about coffins?

No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?

Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.

Listen to me. He's here.

Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.

You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?

I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --

I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.

I thought you were out of town!

That could break the machine.

He does work hard.

Oh!

Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years.

Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?

Karla!

I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.

I don't know...

Oh, god, it's you --

We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...

Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.

I love it here.

Julie! Wait! You okay?

You sure?

You sure it's okay with you?

Why are you doing this to me?

I trusted you.

Pretty cool bar.

I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.

I'll come with you.

Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?

To a great weekend --

Come on, it'll be fun.

Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.

You guys lost?

Cool.

We'll only be a second, okay?

You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece - the dancing, the singing and the white marble --

This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.

He is exhausted.

Where's Thea?

Oh, no - it's too delicious! You're making it up!

There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.

Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?

I have forgotten it, dear.

You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.

What if he is?

You will not say one single word. I know your secret.

Woman, what are you doing here?

I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.

I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep - I want to avoid it.

I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure - quite sure.

Your daughter is ill.

Was she ill before that girl came into your household?

She is not there. The coffin is gone.

I know all you are going to say -I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves  the way she turns her head.

Theodosia --

Well, tell, him.

Why in the world can't you?

I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.

Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.

Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.

But they're somebody's children.

Stand back.

Go through with what?

Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.

What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.

Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?

You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .

Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?

What?

Poor George . . . Sit down.

A boy?

Who is it?

It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?

I know. I know. He didn't go.

What's that?

Hey, Ernie!

Hello, Joseph, trouble?

Well?

Today, over at the house.

Hi, Daddy.

We just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then we're going to drive on down to Florida.

Oh, now, don't rub it in.

Big  see! I don't want one for one night. I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand . . . a great big one.

Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?

What boat you sailing on?

Goodbye, everybody!

Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.

Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?

Well, here's your hat, what's your hurry? All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal, I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.

Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?

Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?

I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.

I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.

Got a match?

What do you mean, and be bored to death?

Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?

Two cents worth of shoelaces?

Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.

What gives?

Violet Bick!

Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy. Now, look  if you'll point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? George?

All of it?

Now look, did you buy anything?

And did you put the envelope in your pocket?

Just a minute  just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . Why, in the twenty-five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why . . . Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You . . . you said . . . What'd you say just a minute ago? . . . They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!

Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?

In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.

Yes, sir.

Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?

Rochester? Well, why Rochester?

Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.

Me?

I'm not very good at this.

Eighteen.

Your . . . your caboose, my lady.

Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.

It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.

George . . . George . . . George . . .

Where are we going?  Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.

Oh, Mary . . .

Have fun.

George Bailey lassos stork.

Where's your coat and hat?

Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.

Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?

How about that one there?

You can?

Wheee!  Faster!

My hair's getting wet!

Get on the rocks!

Shut up.

Putz -- that won't be for hours.

The lighthouse?

Throw it.

I don't know.

Coming up!

Want to talk about it?

Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?

What is it?  What's there?

Chief....

I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.

I know just where to go.

I can't let you take her out.

You're too close.  Back off.

About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast....

I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.

Do I have to?

Because.

I passed out, but I'm okay.

I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....

Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....

Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.

Wait a minute....

There is nothing to discuss.

Could be a shark.  But maybe not.

And sound.

It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.

Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?

Let's get the kid home.

Nothing.

No.

All summer?

That you were fired.

What is it?  What's the matter?

We're alone.

And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.

Did he raise the Kids?

Did you say Cable Junction?

Can I go swimming?

Hi Dad.

Hang on!

It killed her.  It ate her.

Whoops, almost lost one.  Can't play with the dolphins without skis....

Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.

Come on back up here!

Give me back my hat!

But first, a little juice....

Mmmmmm.

It'll be fun, come on!

Faster!  Faster!

Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!

What about me?

I don't think she's such hot stuff.

I want Fruit Loops!

I want to go with you!

Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.

We're ready for you.

Go on, you're tired.

Don't feel bad.

It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.

I'll need more men to look.

What you're saying is we have a Great White shark in the lagoon.

Sure am.

Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.

Pre-opening jitters.

Yeah.

My imagination isn't that good.

How come?

Yeah, you really don't like him.

It's his work.

Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?

Where's the rubber band?

... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?

Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.

Here.

Kathryn...

Finally.

They said you'd be here.

I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?

Yes.  It's faster.

They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.

I did.  He wants it on exhibit.

Come on.

Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --

So?

That's right.

Michael, you don't have to go down there.

You don't have to prove anything.

They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.

Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.

I'm sorry.

You look like an orange worm.

I insist you get rid of that bomb.

How's sleeping beauty?

Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.

Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.

That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.

Believe me, I am.

He's a young one.

No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...

Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?

Sean.  Sean, where are you?

'Course they're also so rich.

You were great out there!

I know!  We can take the gondola ride!

You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.

Let's go, let's go!

Take it up!

Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!

Ahhh, ahhh...

Gotta sneeze.

Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?

Yeah, well I didn't!

Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.

I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.

Thanks.  Bullshot.

Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.

What kind of trouble?

We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island.

In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.

How is he?  Still fighting crime?

You'll spoil her.

Thea....

You're welcome.  I was the one who cried.

Can I make sandwiches...?

What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....

Where have you been...?

You knew...?

Michael!  This thing working?

We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....

Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.

No, no...It's too dangerous....

Your father was six then.  Just like you....

No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.

I want you to get out of the water....

I want you to give up that terrible job.

Dad died from a heart attack....

Oh, I didn't mean....  I'm being such a Grandma....

All you all right?

You're having a good time....

It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....

It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.

It got him....

Promise me you'll be all right....

We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....

Flies the plane....

How can you just take the plane like this?

It's just like driving a car....

You're not going to tell me, are you?

What's wrong?

I could take some time off....

I'll nick the boss' plane again....

I can't....

I'll get it back next time.

Want to go for a little ride?

Hurry!

Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?

Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....

What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...

Keep it steady....

What do you deliver on all those charters you...?

Yeah....

I wish there was something I could do....

Let me speak to Ellen....

You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....

You couldn't find your ass with both hands....

Bad boy....

How many?

Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor....

You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....

I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.

You sure you've done this before?

How long have you known Hoagie?

What's so funny about that?

You getting a reading on them?

What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?

I don't like the song.

Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....

Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....

Who grows more beautiful....

That bad, huh?

Did you like that, Mama?

Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.

As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?

Be my guest. What you got?

I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..

We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?

Who is who?

What time is it?

I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..

What do you mean?

Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?

We're going.

Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..

Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..

I haven't got it.

I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..

That isn't what you said before.

I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.

I dunno what I can do to help you?

Now?

Listen, you don't havta come?

What is that?

I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..

I'm talking, outside the girl?

Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?

Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.

Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.

Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John ..

.. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..

So read it! You just hung a target around her neck!

I know what a "witness" is.

As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?

What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?

Me?

D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?

Lotta scratch-marks on your door?

Are you wearing a uniform?

"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."

I know what you're like ..

Ross told me.

Why can't I stay with you?

He don't know that. I didn't.

He doesn't need my help.

Why?

What was she like?

You think he still loves her?

You think John would like it?

No it isn't .. It's Californian ..

Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..

You want something, darling?

You can drive down there, Sir ..

Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?

Where do you fit in, Trimble?

Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.

Who said anything about "loser?" Where do you get this word "loser?"

This can't be happening to me.

Listen to me!

No one has ever dumped me.

Oh Jerry.

He's asleep, right?

I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.

Well, thanks.

Oh no.

Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.

Oh tsht. Yes.

And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --

But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.

... light.

It's all going to work.

-- especially one like this.

No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.

Well, good evening.

I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --

Look, the other night, I want to apologize.

Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.

I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.

There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.

What about medical?

He's coming over.

I heard.

This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.

I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?

Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.

Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI.  But to me --

I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.

It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?

I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?

You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?

Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.

I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.

You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?

We can still take the offer, Rod.

I think so.

Thanks for coming.

And I can't say his name without laughing I want to eat him up. I want to say goodbye to every bad thought I ever had about relationships.  I mean, I crave this guy... and yet... why... why did I have that affair this weekend?  Does that mean I'm not in love with my boyfriend?

Gorgeous.

Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --

Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?

You gonna get that --

Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.

Hi.

ERRR-IIIC!

No, Dr. Grant says...

What?

Young adult.

It's not safe.

This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.

Sweetheart, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.

He could have died.

Where's Dad?

So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?

Eric!

How was your trip? Profitable?

Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.

I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.

Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.

It looks intact.

I CAN GET HIM!

He used to know me.

Anything good?

You remember the sounds they made?

We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.

Eric, your parents are both here.

You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books.

When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.

Found this, but the battery's dead.

Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.

How much of this island have you explored?

Do you have any kids?

I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.

The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?

Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.

We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.

You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?

But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.

I don't believe you.

No, no, no, no, no, no . . .

Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --

How could you possibly?

Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?

What is?

We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.

Their what?

No way.

So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!

Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.

You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."

So what's your story, Nick?

The kid scores with cheap sentiment.

That little black line?

Hold it down, Nick!

There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:

You've got to be kidding.

Phones are out too.

Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?

Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!

Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?

Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.

They are?  I'll be damned.

There you are.  Out you come.

But you know, I should  really be the one going .

Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.

Anything else, you old fossil?

Okay, who's the jerk?

Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!

Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?

Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -

- - and swallows fresh ones.

Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!

Alan?!

No. We can't.

No.

Alan?

Faster, faster!

What's this I hear at the airport Hammond's not even here?

If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.

Why not?

Are they heavy?

The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?

Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.

This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?

Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?

Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.

Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.

Yeah, they hate me.

Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?

I didn't say you were scared.

What?  What can we do?

Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?

Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -

Tim, Tim, Tim....

Let's go!

C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!

Do as he says!  The power's coming back, Timmy!

You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.

But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!

I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?

That will teach you to trust Grandpa.

I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.

I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -

I hate trees!

No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  Stop! Stop!  Don't let the monsters come over here!

That's not funny.

Fifty.

Hello?

Two.

Who?

Three.  Where's my client?

What are the charges?

That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...

And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.

Doesnit sleep?

Oh?

The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...

So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?

If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...

Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.

Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.

Where's he going?

So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?

Ten minutes...

-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.

Fine -- terrible.

-- Merely in the interests of order.

Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.

I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.

The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.

Will you do me a favor then?

You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.

Did you see him?

When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.

Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?

Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?

You wanted to see me, sir.

To do my work well, I have little time for --

Well, I --

-- Eduard --

Was there something else?

The <u>Orlac</u> claim.

I'm sorry, but I just wondered --

Are you free tonight?

Eduard wanted to marry me.

-- I don't know the Musil district.

Ah -- we're back to the "authorities" you spoke of.

And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.

You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.

I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.

And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?

I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.

I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.

Kafka -- is that your real name?

I'll bear that in mind.

For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me.  You're very good ham actors.

That's <u>mad</u>.

-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.

"Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.

I'm overworked as it is.  "Raban" did you say?

Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?

What's the matter?

It's gone out so quickly?

They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.

But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.

Hi - Carl Denham. I'm A big admirer of your work, sir. I've loved all your discoveries. I really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. It'll be good for you and good for me.

Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -

No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!

Holy God! The mummy walks!

God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!

Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.

I can't imagine you crying.

Barricade the gates! Quick!

He's gonna die! They'll kill him!

I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.

Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?

You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!

Man Eater!!!

Did you see her?

Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!

Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!

Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!

Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.

Excuse me Miss Daniel?

Oh no, I don't think --

Gee.

Why?

If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!

Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--

What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --

I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --

-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.

Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.

Well do you think it was him?

About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?

What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?

You said it was!

Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.

It's kind of late.

Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?

What's the matter?

Just let me know when you are going out and where --

You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.

Please.

No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.

Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.

Spangler says we have a relationship.

Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?

Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?

She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.

Then, close the case.

I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.

I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.

I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?

I'm sorry. I don't understand.

Some mistake perhaps that --

You must be discouraged.

That who?

They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?

Not unusual.

No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.

Town Police.

No.

Everybody's got some, I guess.

Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.

Think this is our guy?

Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.

Are you closing the case?

Where is the child?

Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?

What do you like best about her?

Greatest.

I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?

When is mommy coming back?

Will she pick me up after school?

Yeah?

Mom, I mean dad...

You get a new fence.

All it is is onions and gravy.

Owwww...You're hurting me... You're hurting me...I hate you ...I hate you...

I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...

I don't think so.

Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...

Billy.   This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to talk to you.

Objection.

Is this really your desk?

Is that really your chair?

What did you do when you were little?

Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.

Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.

At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.

I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?

This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.

No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.

Did you wish to?

Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?

So do I.

Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.

Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--

Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?

Did he ever fail to provide for you?

Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.

I consider it less my failure than his.

I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.

Where are you going?

He looks like a terrific kid.

Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.

I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing.  I never thought he'd use it.

Ted, will you take it easy? Revlon's not about to drop an account that represents more than two million in gross billing receipts in a small agency like this, without making us sweat.  Now just relax, okay? Everything's gonna be fine.

Jesus Christ.  That's a real blockbuster.  I always figured you guys had it made.

Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.

Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--

Yes.

You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.

How should I know?

It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...

I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.

Look, Ted, I don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.

Oh, Christ!

I lost him?  I lost him?

Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.

John?

Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life.

You ever see her talk to the walls?

How many?

Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--

I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?

You're sure?

D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?

Huh.. .Hello?

Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?

I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.

Where will you keep them?

He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.

I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?

Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.

Holiness?

General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.

Me. First break of day.

This many?

The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.

Do I have money?

Is that big?

In the Pacific Ocean.

Where is Alsace?

I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.

Britain chooses not to.

Quite simple. Yes. Good.

What is the size of our army, now?

I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.

Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.

I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.

Please, come in, so cold.

I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.

This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.

I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.

I want to go down there.

I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.

Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.

We have enemies.

Yes.

Am I running away?

Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.

This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.

Hmm.

No.

You killed him.

Go!!!

--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?

Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.

I'm laying a spring trap!

That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--

You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.

No!

<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.

And again.  How would you get him on land?

Where?  Where?

Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.

<u>Jack</u>!

<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?

Excuse me?

They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.

And how would we neutralize him?

How big do the bears get?

And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.

He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.

It's too dangerous for--

He thinks they're what?

They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.

When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.

I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.

Really--

Calm down.

It can't work.

He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?

We gotta get to Hector!!

Get him onto shore.

You think?

That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.

They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.

If you get a safe shot...

Thanks for your help.

He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.

I wouldn't.

Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.

Not yet.

What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.

Hey!!

Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?

Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.

Was that like a homo-sexual remark?

Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.

Hank!

Did you get him?

Should I?

I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?

I had a great time last night. Again.

That's not what you came to say.

I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--

I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--

I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.

No.

Myra.

Phone call, Clarice. It's God.

Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.

Lecter said a lot of things.

But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.

Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?

FBI, Catherine, you're safe.

You're all right! Where is he?

I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.

He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.

Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -

Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?

You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.

He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?

Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?

What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.

Are you finished?

But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.

Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?

You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?

Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.

That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?

I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.

Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?

Reasonably so. Yes.

And the questionnaire...?

I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.

No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.

And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?

Ahhh... Why?

Yes.

Go, Doctor.

Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.

No. Tell me why.

I - ran away...

On what basis would they reject him?

No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.

No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?

What did you do?

They were slaughtering the spring lambs?

Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?

Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.

I won't waste your time and Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges. Clarice Starling and that awful Jack Crawford have wasted far too much already. I only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl... Let me help you now, and I'll trust you when it's all over.

What...?

Your "father"?

What?!

The Ottawa are gone.

They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.

Much further?

They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?

Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English.

In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?

You do not know what you are saying!

Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...

Will you consider that?

I see...

Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.

Fort Edward, then?

I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!

And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!

How long?

Head for... for the white water.

And if we're unlucky?

That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.

I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.

Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...

A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.

Many men here, their homes are in the path.

I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.

The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?

Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.

Sergeant! Form three ranks!

Shoulder arms!  Present! 

Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!

We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?

No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?

Excuse me. What did you say?

Yes.

Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.

The honors of war?

What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?

Not exactly a big ocean country.

Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...

Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.

I thought they were your friends?

Jesus Christ...

Go on!

Your suit, Becky!

Huh?  I...uh...uh...

You did good...

That was a loud one wasn't it?

How's astronaut training?

We're on backup air.

We made it!

Something wrong, Cobb?

What's wrong with it?

No!

How do you feel, DeJesus?

Okay, number 23's full.

Hey, Bo...when're you going to be off that thing?  I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.

Bullshit.

What happened?

No way, Mister Beck!  <u>No</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation!

"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!

You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?

Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.

Typhoon?!

How'd you do that?

Getting some food.

Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?

What is it?

What on earth's the matter with you?

What is it?

Are you sure you saw something?

My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?

So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?

Is there something we should know about you, Soap?

A what?

I wanted to talk to you about that.

Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.

I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.

I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?

The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.

Like what?

Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?

I don't know what you mean.

Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.

So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?

I hate these Southern shites.

Nope.

I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.

Have you counted the money?

Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.

How long has he been in there, son?

That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?

Yeah?

Is that you, Dean?

OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?

Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?

Who was that?

So do you know these geezers well?

Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?

There's nothing in it!

Who's this fat man, then?

You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.

Everything all right out there, Tom?

I'll see ya.

Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.

It's pay day, ain't it?

Yes?

Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.

No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.

Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.

Look. Go on, look.

If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?

Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?

The money, the gear!

Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem?

We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?

If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.

I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--

Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?

And you and Private Graves--

We're not running a dating service here.

I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.

Sam the Man.

Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.

Skinny?

--it didn't come out of a cereal box.

You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?

You were in a fight--

Same weight I always was.

This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.

He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--

They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.

PDA?

So I'm part-Indian?

Big O was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink.

I have a B average.

Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?

Right.

Hey, Mikey--

Mikey--

Seriously.

They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.

Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--

You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.

Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--

I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.

Black Seminoles?

This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.

Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.

I haven't seen anybody doing that.

You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.

Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away by the current--]

Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?

This girl is a friend of yours?

Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.

Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.

They just wanted it to be one of theirs--

Never heard from him again?

No.

You thought any more about our murder?

Charley Wade.

You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?

He agreed it wasn't exactly news--

The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--

Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.

Mami, how old were you when my father--

I'm Sheriff Deeds--

Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?

I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.

I'm not open. We were just talking.

Not if you have half a brain in your head.

Can I get this?

I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--

Three months.

Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.

That's how I ruined my stomach.

He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--

Something wrong?

Field trip?

I see she built a place up here by the river.

She's done well for herself--on her own and all--

Your boy, there--

So why did you come back here, Sam?

You don't want to be Sheriff.

How come it feels the same?

You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?

Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.

I didn't want to be going around your back.

Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.

I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.

--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.

As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?

Yeah?

I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.

That's Butterfield...

Maybe they're not tricks.

Thanks, Billy.

You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?

I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.

We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.

Please.

Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!

Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?

So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?

I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.

What's the connection?

He's a secretive man.

Sorry.  You asked.

Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?

Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.

I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?

He's good.

They were jealous of him.

Okay.  I'll keep digging.

Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?

He was the real thing, right?

Stuff?

What was that?

I've got to help him.

... oh... God...

Valentin?

It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.

What were you doing up there?

What makes you so sure?

You believe that?

Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --

It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.

And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann

Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.

Him too.

I'm sorry, D'Amour...

Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.

My God.

Hold on.

The Puritan?

Harry D'Amour.

People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?

That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.

I don't think so.  You need me alive.

Oh yeah?

And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.

Nobody's better off this wav!

Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?

Call me tomorrow.

One question.

I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.

Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.

Oh, hi, Elaine.

It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.

A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?

Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie Brown.

What do you feel like singing, Bob?

I could cut the ones that are left for you.

I don't want to go home.

Hey look, it's Sausalito.

Really?

But, I'm mean.

You made it.

Nice one.

What happened to your toe?

Do you ever see him?

I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?

Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.

I'm going to miss you.

Why can't it last?

I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?

Why are you crying?

He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...

Hello?

Hi, Lydia.

Oh, come on.

Hello?

Hello? Yes?

Evelyn Waugh?

You smell weird.

See you later.

Yeah.

Do you think it's done?

Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?

Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.

...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?

It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.

Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?

I'm still shaking.

I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.

What're these?

I found them in your file box.

The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.

How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.

You fucking bastard.

You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.

You raised me, like a son.

You killed my parents.

Father, please don't die.

Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"

You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.

And also that...

What's that got to do with you?

What?!?!

I don't understand what's going on.

Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry.

When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."

Are you alright?

Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.

What about after?

Plenty of time.

That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."

How much time do we have?

Hello?

Maya?  What do you mean?

You know what?  You can go.

You do know, don't you.  That these are also numbers.  Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666.  The sign of the Devil.

The police used him as a witness in this case.

As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.

Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?

What do you mean by that?

Would you sign it for me?

He could see me.

Thanks again for everything.

We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.

Monica, what did you do?

Whatever.

I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.

That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.

When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?

So that means it's alright for you to act like that?

Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.

I can take it.

Can I take your coat?

Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.

So how long is this trip?

Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?

That too tight?

So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?

I know...

No.

I don't know how to walk in heels.

You ever been in love?

They ever love you back?

The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.

Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.

You shoot like a girl.

Coach hates me, doesn't she?

So what are these Spanish guys like?

So...does it hurt?

He's alright, but my Dad can take him.

I don't know.  A lot.

Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.

How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.

What's that?

I'm not the one who put this scar here.

I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.

See you made it.

Hey.

You having fun?

Clothes.

Give me the ball.

Yo, where's the "D"?

I won.

I...can't.

Hey.

Sorry about your game.

Hey.

Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.

We're going to get some food.

Can we talk?

I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.

You don't think so?

You're what?

When did you decide all this?

Actually, I don't...

You visiting?

Cause I don't get it.

It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.

Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.

What's that supposed to be, psychology?

So?

Give it yourself.

Zeke.

Fine, then how many nights home is that?

Whose truth are you talking about?

Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?

You don't wanna hurt your back.

You work too hard, Pop.

What people?

Lucky kid.

Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro.

From your mouth.

Look, I'm busy.

And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"

Yeah.

You ok?

Call 911. Call 911 right now.

Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?

Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?

Uh-huh.

Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.

My mother had breast cancer.

It was scary though.

...what the fuck is this...?

I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.

GET THE FUCK OUT.

uh...uh...What is it?

...yeah...

Yeah, but I don't know --

Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.

ok.

Yeah.

I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --

Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --

It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --

I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.

--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.

Bye, bye, Claudia.

I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.

It's my favorite place --

Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --

Why not?

Yeah.

I'm sorry --

I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....

It's ok.

....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?

-- can I get you?

What happend, what's going on?

DADDY! DAD! DAD WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?

GIVE US YOUR MONEY.

How much you pay me for my help?

You wanna take my statement, I'll perform for you, gotta get paid though, gotta get PAID.

No school today.  My teacher got sick.

Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know --

You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?

Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?

Do you have love in your heart?

That's right.

You see?

...please...

This is so fucked, Solomon. I don't deserve this.

I don't know.

I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?

...no...no goddamn use.  I have a son, y'know?

...ah...

Do me a personal favor --

...I can't hold onto this anymore...

I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?

I think you have the wrong number.

If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --

-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --

It's not like I'm trying to attack you --

She does.  From when you were a boy.

No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --

C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?

Yeah.

And what did your parents do?

Does you mother still work?

Where does that name come from?

They wouldn't?

When did he go off chemo?

.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --

I've heard your tapes on the phone.

When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....

It's interesting.

What? What? What now?

You can't just come in here.

I am calm.

There's no disturbance.

You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --

You're here.

I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --

--- What was that?

...you know...

Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --

Are you ok?

We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.

I can't fuckin' do this.

What were you saying, Stanley?

Come home soon after the show.

Did you tell her?

I don't think I want that.

I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....

Just once.

Two years...three years...

What? No, Rose, jesus, no --

You deserve to die alone for what you've done.

No.

Hello?

She's asleep.

I'm Bob.

You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --

Are you on drugs right now?

Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --

Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.

Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.

Let me call you a car, Linda.

Linda --

No, Linda, you don't understan --

listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...

You motherfucker...you motherfucker.... YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

Pink Dot.

What are they gonna do -- beat us?

Stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there I'm gonna beat your ass --

Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?

Go to it, handsome.

Why didn't you answer those questions?

...oh Jesus, what the fuck...?

Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.

What is that?

M'lady...?

M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...

Mother -- ?

It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!

D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours.  And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate.

What do you propose to do?

What are they doing?

The Prison of Belle Sur.

Who is he, Aramis?

Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --

Go on.

We must stop him!

Poor Phillippe!

Where are you going?!

But --

Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.

A simple theological discussion.

Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.

I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.

D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?

Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --

Forgiveness.

Aramis... is this the way to hell?

Where are we?

And why are you so glum?

But why?

Coming?

But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.

D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.

What do we do now?

What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.

That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!

But -- are you sure?

Die?  What...?

Thanks, but not for me.

Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.

Athos, please...!

Where are you going?

Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself.

Recent hours have been a shock.

The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.

Phillippe...?

One for all.  All for one.

This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.

But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --

Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!

I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.

I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?

... The ball... Continue.

Food, moron.

I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --

Did they kill him?

Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?

Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?

Sire!  I -- How did you --

Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.

You are beautiful.  You know you are.

Shall I leave?

Raoul... Oh, Raoul...

You mind if I ride with you?

Yeah?

We're by Ozone...

Bullshit...

I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!

Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!

So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.

Find out for me.

I'll take the south end -

What?

So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -

It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?

Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.

Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?

Alright, where is she?

So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.

Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!

Yeah?

Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.

What's going on here?

No, but I'm listening.

Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?

Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?

Holy shit -

Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!

Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!

Oh man...what happened?

I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.

You must be going somewhere.

Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.

Are you a regular there?

You don't seem afraid of much.

No.  It wasn't like that!

What about him?

It was you who did the asking.

If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?

And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.

In thirty-five minutes.

They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.

How long do I have?

Where?

This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?

We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.

Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?

I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...

Why not?

I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.

You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.

If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...

Who did he ask for?

How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!

Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.

And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.

Who is it?

What'd it say?

Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.

Something Lecktor said.

You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?

It's getting late and...

Will...?

There's somebody in the house, Jack...

...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?

Can you give me an idea of the conditions...

I'll probably go back to it someday.

That was nice of you to think of that.

Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?

I'll see you later. All right?

Who?

THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.

According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?

Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?

Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?

Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?

Are you a man?

You did very well.  I apologize for the crude images.  Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights.

Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?

Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.

She'll be in, in the morning...

3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.

I don't understand.

He's right-handed.

'Intimate? !"

I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.

If I were?

Molly?

Me, too. And very erotic...

I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?

Is Crawford going with you?

What's the problem, Molly?

Lt. Fisk said...

Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?

How?

You went in the apartment?

Did the girl die?

What kind of coffee do you like?

Yes.

Why should I tell you?

Pray tell.

Pictures?

Do you dream much, Will?

I don't have one right now.

You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.

I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.

Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'

Hey, I really enjoyed your set.

Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!

I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!

Andy... this is every comedian's dream.

They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!

Andy?

Tony Clifton.

I can't move my arm.

My hair is coming out.

Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?

So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?

But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.

B-but I have them.

Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.

Cue the commercial!

Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.

Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.

Why Memphis?

And all this will be for real?

Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!

Go away.

GET OFF!

T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --

Give me the book.

Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!

You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...

This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this!  Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?

Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!

Excuse me, Andy...

"Philosophically"?

I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.

"Burlesque"?

Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!

Can I help you with something?

Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.

Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."

I saw Michael!

I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.

Weird.

What?!

You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?

You weren't supposed to relieve me.

Did you hear that?

Are you sure this line is clean?

There's something about him, isn't there?

But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.

... yes.

You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.

I got a fibrillation!

We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.

What the fuck do they want with me?!

Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.

Why not?

Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?

When?

How did I beat you?

Do you understand, Neo?

So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?

I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?

Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?

Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.

No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!

Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --

Tank.

I'm going to make the call.

How...?!

Yeah.

I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.

But you already know what I'm going to tell you.

Hello, Neo.

I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.

What the hell is this?!

Uh-oh...

Should I be?

Did you go to her?

What did you just say?

How much like it?  Was it the same cat?

Is Morpheus alive?

Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!

That I would have to make a choice...

No, you... have to be.

You don't have...

Zion?

Holy shit!

Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...

Operator.

What are your plans?

It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?

Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.

No, all we got is $40.

I gotta get the stuff.

See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'

No.

'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'

Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?

Who's the girl?

Look at her.

I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?

So?

Panther...

Waddaya think?

You got some mouth!

Don't promise...just deliver.

Let's get out of here.

You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?

Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!

Oh great...hey - Winstons?

Hey, shut up.

You getting out too?

What's a'matter?

Diane, how are you feeling?

You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...

In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.

About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.

Hey, where you been?

Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.

"Francis Macomber."

It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.

I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.

Sure...it's not that...I mean...

Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.

You know...like restaurants, night clubs...

C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.

...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?

and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?

Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?

Come on.

Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.

Did you speak to the Governor?

Just plain 'Joe'?

Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...

Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.

Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?

From the Korean War.

Oh, the goddam party --

Yeah, but --

What do you do that for?

I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.

Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.

-- Did I hear 'business'?

...See you tomorrow night.

Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?

Well... goodnight.

You're taking this too far, Drew.

The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --

It's just a saying, Mr. Black,

It doesn't matter.

Who are we talking about?

Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?

I was saying to Quince we won't need --

I'm all excited --

Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --

You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"?

What are their feelings?

I think it's time you went home, Drew.

Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?

And what do I get?

Yeah, that's what he said.

I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.

Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.

I nuttin' to do wi' dat.

Doctor lady make it irey.

She knows how she feel.

Good morning, Mr. Parrish.

The Board is waiting.

'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.

Thanks.

Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.

I am Joe.

You act like you never had peanut butter before --

Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.

No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.

I've got plenty of friends.

And I'll be a visitor.

Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.

I mean I appreciate that.

I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.

How long have you been standing there?

Where are you going?

I'm still here.

Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --

If there is anything else, don't hesitate --

Sounds fair enough.

Bill --

How about giving a guy a break?

-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --

And more.

Hello, Bill.

What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?

I'm not hungry.

Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.

And I don't give a shit.

-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.

You're what?

Which is what?

Okay.

He is --

'...I know, it's none of my business.'

Are you giving me orders?

The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --

'Take me'...?  Where?

I'm sorry --

Yes what?

What question?

The 'question' --

...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.

Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.

Drew told me.

That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.

I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.

I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.

You're terrible.

Are you okay?

Well, go get 'em, Pops.

Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.

I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --

I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --

Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.

What a night.

Daddy --

I love you, Daddy --

Nothing lasts.

I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --

79.

69.

You don't know?

Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *

This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.

No, let's go.

This was your room. You're up in 304 now.

Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.

Do you remember me?

Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?

Yeah.

Have I told you what this man did?				*

Then you shouldn't have to ask.

Why?

Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.

How do I know he did that to you?

He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.

He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.

Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.

My wife used to call me Lenny.

Why would you do that?

What's wrong?

Who?

Neither do I.

Yes.

On the house.

A BEER, please.

I can't make new memories. Everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.

How can you read that again?

It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?

I don't think so.

I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -

We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.

It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.

Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.

Prove it.

What do you mean "bad news"?

Envelopes?							    *

You're not coming?

He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?

Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -

I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and -

Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *

Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.

No.  I was in Namibia...

We know these people...!

And...?

Sal Maguda.

She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?

...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...

You need to consider a few issues.

I got the item.

I thought we had to meet the Man.

When?

We want it back.

What's "nothing"?

There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...

Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...

Mojitas...?

Tell <u>me</u> everything.

You know how improbable this is...?

Like...?

Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.

Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...

And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?

Yero, by himself?

What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?

José...

You afraid of violence?

Red light, green light, José?

Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.

I do.  We don't do business with him...

He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?

Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?

The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.

To the limit.

How much we looking for?

Verdado where?

I am asking.  You to me.

Go ahead.

If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...

Detective Crockett.

4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.

"Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."

You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...

It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...

Who are you talking to?

You okay?

...the lease, the phones, the cars...layers of false ident. Would take the FBI weeks.  How long did it take them?  Three hours? Four?  This means, "We can reach out and touch somebody."  Like Bad Teleflora.

Why?

I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.

So lay it out, my brother...

Then what were we talking to you for?

What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?

I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.

Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.

Yeah?

Must be some mess back there.

Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?

Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?

If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.

Cut it out. That's cheating, teasing me so I can't think. Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna beat you!

For money.

Oh hell, forget it.

Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso. I mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.

Where'd that come from?

But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.

Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I...

Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...

I'm scared.

What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!

Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.

Sounds like they knew you.

Hey -- whatsa matter?

Hell, don't cry about it!

What you got me up here for?

Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?

He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is he all right?

Looks like a cheap hotel.

Two kilos.

Years?

--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.

Yeah. How's Mom?

DAD!

Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.

Just what?

Girlfriend?

Just Erich.

Hello, Billy.

What's wrong?

What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!

You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.

We go back.

Max, sit down. You're in no shape to kill anybody.

...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.

'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.

Just got some news on Bell.

Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.

I think I've been poisoned.

What is it with you man, what the hell is it?

What lawyer?

Jeremy...

The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."

Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.

You really love flashing that thing, don't you?

Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it.  No definite signs of TB, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure.

You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.

The Department of Public Health...

Excuse me, I'm talking to you.

Oh, that's gonna work.

You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?

I only got...

Its muscles are locked.

You feel anything?

You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?

He didn't do it!

He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...

I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...

Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.

Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...

...you don't even know what you're looking for.

It's no use! They know we're in here!

I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?

This wing configuration. I've never...

My God.

Oh, my!

Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?

What do you want to know?

Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...

Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.

Shouldn't I be in a hospital?

Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.

Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.

You want to read it?

I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.

This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.

Done?

I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.

You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?

I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!

See, isn't this nice?

I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.

You--fooler...!  Did I do good?

Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.

Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?

That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...

"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"

I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!

Will she still love him with that special perfect love?

I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?

Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?

Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?

Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.

Annie, what is it?

The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.

Now don't fuss, Paul.

Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.

It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.

Did I do good?

You don't think he's dead, do you?

Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.

I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.

Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.

No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.

Hey, Pete.

Answer me a couple things?

Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?

You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?

Has she been buying any odd things lately?

Marcia, please.

I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.

- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -

One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.

You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?

Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw.

You're not interested in seeing how it looks.

You won.

What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.

Feel like pleading for your life?

Nyah!

Fight a bit of a cold..

Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.

Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..

-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..

Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..

Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.

Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.

Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.

So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.

Range is two kay.

Do you know me?

Would you mind if I'm on top?

Where's the bloody -

- this is very disconerting..

May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?

So where did I got right?

There's nearly 2 million in London.

Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?

Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..

Before you are.

How's it going?  Everything okay?

We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..

What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.

No.  Should I?

Like what?

When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?

If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -

Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.

Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?

And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.

I don't.  No exactly.

Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.

They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.

..not in time to save him.

Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.

Luther, say again.

Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..

Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.

What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!

Only four more cars.

Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like.  If heís got that list, heís going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.

I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.

Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?

You were in the car!

Where were you?

What are you going to do?

Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...

Max made a deal with you?

I didn't say that.

I just need you to be safe.

I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan.

Claire.

Go ahead.

<u>Are you intact</u>?

No sir.

I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.

Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.

Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.

I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.

I'm not letting this list get out in the open.

It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.

Just don't know why I'd be doing it.

It's quite out of the question.

I don't know Job any more than he knows me.

What was your deal with Job?

Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.

That's not it.  That's not the list.

In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.

Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím coming to you.

I thought I was going to see Max.

Then what am I doing here?

Oh?  What's the problem?

Why not?

Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.

- no.  She canít know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Thereís too much at stake, Ethan.

Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?

Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?

What's going on?

That's what we do isn't it?

Thirty-two and change.

How long until we reach the Chunnel?

Yes...  Itís him.

No, I want to see the dessert cart.

Rita. Pass the wine.

I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.

Okay.

He got hit by a bus.

You've got to come. You've got to give me away.

Here.

It's temporary.

Mona?

Oh, Cosmo!

Why you looking around so much?

It's wrong to just let them go.

Yes!

I have no life.

This is good. Uhh...

Where'd Johnny find you?

Why?

I don't know.

No.

Stupid yourself.

I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.

He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!

A bride without a head!

I've got you.

It's so bright.

I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.

What did I do?

Snap out of it!

Alright.

Hi.

Beautiful. Sad. She died!

It's really cold.

Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.

This is your place.

I'm really afraid.

Why not?

Let me go home.

Will you marry me?

How near is she to death?

Yeah.

I can't. I need my family around me now.

Will you live here?

So we'll sell the house.

Did he tell her?

Thanks. What's the matter with you?

Do you love him, Loretta?

Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.

I... a... slept with my fiancé's brother.

Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.

The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!

Yes.

May I walk with you a ways?

We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.

Look.

I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.

I don't know.

A witch,  a witch,  burn her!

Halt!  Who goes there?

It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.

Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?

Order, eh -- who does he think he is?

Well, I didn't vote for you.

Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...

Oh!

How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?

None shall pass.

A scratch?  Your arm's off.

You're a liar.

Look!

I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?

Who ... Who breaks out?

Ni, ni, ni!

Ni!

What?

Who are they?

By what name are you known?

You know my name?

Where?

Well you could say: "Dennis"

I'm averting my eyes, Lord.

Make a bridge out of her.

Exactly.  So... logically ...

I feel fine.

Who approaches the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see.

What is your name?

What is your favorite colour?

I can't.

Did you kill all those guards?

They cost fifty pounds each!

You killed eight wedding guests in all!

Herbert.

Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!

And make sure he doesn't leave.

Make sure he doesn't leave.

Where are you going?

Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.

Camelot ...

Well, she's got a point.

... I Bet you're gay.

No look, really, this isn't nescess ...

There's nothing wrong with ... that.

Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...

Oh!

Stop saying the word!

So?

Sixty.

Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?

And she sent no word down?

You've got three broken ribs, man!

Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.

What's this?

Be careful who sees it.

What's your name?

Checked and locked, sir.

I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.

I wish to see my mother.

Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.

No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?

By whose authority?

The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.

Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.

Her Highness' Equerry.

Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.

Awaiting my orders.

Go inside at once.

If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.

What brings you here?

Do you hunt?

So...?

Too busy looking after themselves.

No loyalty.

She'll never understand it.

Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.

My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.

Those, over there, there.

They're ready now.

Must they always follow us?

You should never have gone out in such foul weather.

Then they may read about me.

I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.

Should we take it seriously?

A fine choice, sir.

A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.

I'm sorry, ma'am?

Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--

Why was I not informed?

He appears to be ... standing by his horse.

Well?

How long has he been this sick?

Read it.

Why not?

There is one other matter.

Ma'am?

Where is my son?

Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?

Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.

Nick, Alex, how are we today?

What's her problem?

Hello?

It is.

So how did it know my name, then?

Because I didn't know where else to go.

Well?

Where do we go?

It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...

The Police, then...

Then where do we go?!

I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.

You don't get it, do you?

You feel it?  It's different this time.

Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.

Shit...

Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?

Cool.

They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.

Someone's shut off my money!

What do you mean "you know"?

Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.

I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.

We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.

Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?

There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?

So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.

I understand.

Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?

Fine. I'll check out in the morning.

Get going. You don't want to be late.

That's okay.

Betty Elms?

I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.

Hi.

You're still here?

I can call them... I can call my dad.

Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.

Yes?

No ..........I.

She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.

No.

No...I need to sleep.

What's wrong?

Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?

Okay... but just...just to see.

There's nothing?

Strange to be calling yourself.

"You're still here?"

"So... surprise"...

"Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."

"Before I kill you."

Don't stop!

Those men in front, in the car.

You're so easy.

I had a dream about this place.

Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.

You must come in first place to move on !

Why should we trust you ?

Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?

First Bank ? But how ?

McCay knows ?

What are you doing ?

Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?

It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.

Obviously, but what's the way out ?

I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.

I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.

And you believe that ?

I wanted to let his family know....

Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.

Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?

Are you Matthew Parker ?

That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.

NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.

Is it over ?

What's next Walt ?

An elevator ?

You okay ?

But, he's...

Stop the hydraulics.

What's wrong ?

Zach, how old are you, son ?

That was rather.... disappointing.

Do you think the assistant, what's his name...

Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?

Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ?

Maybe you should get over fears.

That is repugnant. You have the habits of a goat.

Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?

Thank you very much.

Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.

So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.

Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !

Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?

Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him !

I think we should follow him...

Are you okay ?

Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?

Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.

What now ?

No, idiot. Where do we go now ?

My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.

Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!

Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.

Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.

Do what?

Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.

Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?

You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?

I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.

What does that mean?

Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.

We have a baby?

Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.

Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?

Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.

Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?

Thanks.

Special effects?

And she saved it.

Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.

Hi.

Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??

All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?

I guess you have.

This is really very nice of you.

Vada?

Your mother?

I don't need you to be telling me to...

Getting off please.

Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team.  With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous.

It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.

Get married?

You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.

Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.

Let me see if it changes colors on me.

Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.

I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.

Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.

It's dangerous!!

You mean,  this ring?

Never heard of her.

Yeah I guess...sort of.

It's not his fault!

No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.

Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something.

That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?

...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.

Wow!

Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.

Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.

Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?

Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...

I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.

A secret, I like that.

No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.

No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.

Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.

We may go out for coffee after the meeting so don't expect us before midnight.

Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?

Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.

Bye Aunt Rose.

So what's wrong?

I mean...with your car.

Something wrong?

Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.

They're enormous, I know.

I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.

How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.

He's so tiny.

He's a great poet.

No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.

Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.

You're such a baby.

I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.

Ex...ex, ex...

Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??

I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.

I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.

Excuse me, what about the job?

I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.

Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.

I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.

Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.

In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.

Does it make it easier to win?

Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.

I had a good time tonight.

Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.

Home sweet home.

I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.

Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.

Kiss me.

I ahh, better go.

I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.

You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.

Shelly?

Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!

I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.

Vada, we're trying to work here.

Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?

The money?

She likes to play bingo.

Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?

Is that the fish you won at the carnival?

Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.

He's okay isn't he?

Really?

Why?

Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?

Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.

No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.

Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?

I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.

No.

Really?

Who's winning?

He won't give it to me.

Vada? VADA?? What happened??

Big Ringo fan.

The boys at school don't think I am.

Do you like putting makeup on people?

Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.

I like my name.

I think it should be outlawed.

Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?

She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.

Naah, I don't wanna.

Where's your bike?

Is that your Dad?

Here.

Sorry.

Pacifist!

Bed wetter!

No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.

You can come to my house for dinner?

Well when you get older, you just have to.

Say something it's too quiet.

You better not either.

For what?

Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?

No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.

Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.

I've lost interest.

Blood oath.

We'll never be the same.

Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.

There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...

Two words.

I'm taking my next book to Viking.

You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.

I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.

That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.

But he sure can kiss.

So it's sweet of you to be protective...

It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...

Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...

They both have some growing up to do.  But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time.

And you think he's kept this to himself.

How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?

Every day.  She makes the bed.

Still.  All's fair in love and w...

Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.

It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...

Big weddings are so strange.

Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.

You miss her, huh?

I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.

Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...

I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.

I'm up against a deadline.

The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...

Isabelle?  I need to talk to Kim...

Jules, what's wrong...

Lower.

I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.

He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...

All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...

I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!

Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...

I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you.

Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.

Am I disturbing you?

I said, I've been real tired.

What did you say your name was?

You going today?

I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.

I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.

His Word.

How is she?

You want anything?  A drink?

Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.

Yes, but we're just singing.

Howdy.

Hey!

Come on. He's a crook.

Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.

Business School so I can run Haven's business.

Listen, do you know anything about cars?

Did you see who that was?

He is just wonderful.

All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.

Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.

The car broke down.

I don't know his first name.

Have your children been deaf since birth?

Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?

Yes. Who's this?

Who is thin?

Thirty?

My mother. died in '72. They told me after. They said they couldn't find me before, so they told us after.

Yes.

I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.

Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...

Where's Bill?

We just got a gold record.

You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.

You want a ride into town?

No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.

Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.

Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.

That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?

Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...

Try to keep it to a minimum.

Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.

Naw, she don't mind.

Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.

They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---

The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?

Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.

Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.

Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.

Not to anybody. She sings.

Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?

We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?

Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?

What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.

Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.

Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.

That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.

Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?

Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.

Mickey, can I talk to you alone?

We ain't got all fuckin' day!

Through the power of the simple word---

Only on a much grander scale.

That's the Mickey and Mallory way.

The entire wing?

You can't be serious?

Roger?

What the hell happened to you?

Are you all set?

Yeah, we met. They're good men.

We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.

Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.

They passed the 'edge' along to us.

I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.

No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.

So we got a deal. Four deputies---

Why don't we make it three deputies and you?

Could we go with you and film it?

How 'bout that furniture plant?

Yeah.

They done that too long in my family.

Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!

Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?

What's the matter, boy? Never smile?

I know.

No. What you usually say, I guess.

You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.

Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.

That's two bucks, Joe.

That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.

How d'you mean?

Get out of here!

Not here, Duff.

What?

I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.

Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.

Yeah. Well, I do.

Surprised?

Hi.

I'll have some coffee, please.

I can see why.

That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.

Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.

Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.

No point fixin' it!

Don't do that!

You heard me!

Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.

Where' you goin'?

Just get her drunk.

Good-bye, Frankie.

I'm Duff.

Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.

Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?

My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?

That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.

It's just that I hate empty rooms.

Going back, huh?

I know he wasn't much of a father.

Hello.

I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.

I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.

And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.

Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.

Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.

Well, I got married to one of them.

Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?

I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.

Your Raoul?

How long's it been?

Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?

Let me get you another glass of wine.

Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?

What are you doing in here?

Can you get us into Straylight?

Easy...

We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.

The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.

Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.

Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.

Then I'd ask you what your terms are.

You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.

First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.

That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.

Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.

You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".

Tell me the words.

Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?

Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.

What elders?

Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?

Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?

Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.

What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?

Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?

What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.

What?

How much time you got left?

Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.

I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.

Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.

Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?

He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?

I gotta know... did it work>

Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.

I'm going in.

It sounds like you.

Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.

I know.

Is he going to make it?

The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.

My God... these people are insane.

I'm still going in.

Who?

Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.

What?

I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.

Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.

Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.

What?

It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.

Oh, man! Who told?

Well excuse me.

Who told!

Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.

Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.

Bridgework?

Wings?

That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.

: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?

Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.

It's an expose on cafeteria food.

No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.

Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.

It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--

I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-

Hey--what are you thinking about?

This--this is a luau that sells packing material!

How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?

Josie Grossie.

These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!

Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.

Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.

Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.

You're twenty-three years old!

Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.

Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.

Are you--scared?

You have to say that. You're my student.

You have to say that. You're my teacher.

Yeah. To watch the world go by.--

No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.

told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!

No, I'm alone.

So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?

What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?

Please. Please don't walk away.

Yes.

You ruined the whole thing!

I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.

Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...

Are you having fun?

Yes.

Coming...

Taste it.

Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...

Uh-huh.

We're here!  You sent for us!

You got your room straightened out yet?

I told you I want that room unpacked.

You set this all up, didn't you?  One of your sick jokes?

Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.

He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.

Jesse, help!

There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.

So, what about you and that Poletti girl?

Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?

You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.

What are you doing here?

You mean a shithead.

"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"

Are you okay.

Are you sure?

Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.

And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?

About not finding any bogey men?

What is it - What's wrong?

It's gone now.

You should eat something - you'll feel better.

Jesse, God - what happened?

Who, Jesse?

You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!

Hi.

What's so funny?

Jess?

Yeah, I'm fine.  Just really hot upstairs.

There's a Jesse on the phone.

We're going up to bed now.

Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.

What?

Can we talk?  Just for a minute?

Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.

If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.

Jennifer --

You didn't think we'd let you go alone?

I used to live in this house.

Freddy?

I don't know...

Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.

Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.

I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.

It's over.  It's over.

This is nice.

It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?

Just until we get things under control.

I can't believe I just did that.

Stop blaming yourself.

The truth.

Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?

You sound like Peter Pan.

Nancy...

That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.

In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.

We've got work to do.

Science...I suppose.

There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?

I could've saved them.

My God.

Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.

Why is he after us?

Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...

Lovely to meet you.

And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.

Oh Jesus.

Would you like a cup of tea before you go?

No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.

I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...

Hello.  Hi.  Hi.

Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?

You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.

Floppy, huh?

Too complicated.

No, I didn't.

I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...

Why?

Here we are.  Do you want to come up?

I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.

These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...

Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.

Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.

'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'

Eleven.

'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'

You like Chagall?

With a goat playing a violin.

Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?

How are you doing?

That's not true.

Hi.

No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.

You were saying...

But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.

... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?

I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.

I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.

Yes...

Thank you, Bernie.  Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?

Can I have your autograph?

Where are you going?

Yup.

Bella -- this is Anna.

Do you want to stay?

Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...

Bloody hell, this is fun.

Yes.  What do you think?

I was called and I came.  What's up?

Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.

No, I'm sure it'll be fine.

Are you a fan of Henry James?

Cappuccino as ordered.

I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.

I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...

You haven't slept with her, have you?

Do you ever masturbate?

You didn't know she had a boyfriend?

Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.

I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.

There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.

Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.

Does she know you're coming?

Hey.

Which was?

Well, okay.  There's this girl...

Spike!

I wouldn't go outside.

Was it you?

No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.

We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.

The one down your trousers.

Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.

But you have no proof.

Yes, Mister Harding?

M-m-m-ma'am?

Yes, Billy?

What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?

P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...

Get up, Billy.

Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.

Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!

Oh, I had them removed.

After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.

Yes, Mister McMurphy.

Certainly, Mister McMurphy.

Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?

Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.

I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!

So do I!

You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?

Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.

I hope everything is settled.

Gotta go now, ma'am...

Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!

What's your name, buddy?

Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!

That's okay, kid...

Yeah, kid?

W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!

Marry who?

Say it again.

Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...

What for?

She won't give me any more cigarettes!

I second the motion!

Ha! Did ya see that!  Hey, Cheswick!

Yeah, Mack?

Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.

What? What?

He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.

Yeah, my feet are cold...

Martini!

What are you doing?

It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.

Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!

Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?

You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?

Right!

Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are gonna screw up my plans. So just gone on back to bed like nothin' happened.

Gimme the ball!

My turn.

Poker!

To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure...

Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?

Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!

Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning...

Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you guys down, but ya gotta come right back up! 'Kay?

I'll bet a buck you don't do it!

Somebody's coming!

Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?

Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.

I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.

Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.

Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...

We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?

Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't have to cry... You ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying...

Is everything all right?

What are these men doing up wandering around?

They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.

Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.

I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...

Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.

No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?

My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?

Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?

You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?

I'm a liberal!

No.

...has a prior commitment.

Larry, can I borrow your car keys?

Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?

Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.

That's not the point.

How could you do this to me?

Why can't you just tell me?

Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.

So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?

Why are you asking me this?

Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.

Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.

I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in.

It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...

Hi, Peter.

So.  You found him.

And she's a knock-out, too.

Hey--

Nice dress.

Why are you doing this?

So were you.

How about music?  You like classical?

Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.

Hi.

You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.

Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.

As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.

Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.

And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.

Been here long?

Any night.

Aren't you going to tell me who you are?

Excuse me?

What looks good?

So what do you think?

Faith, this is my mother.

What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?

How about the other one?  His friend.

You don't have any idea?

He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.

Come on, it's not so bad.

But what?

Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.

Kate, is something the matter?

It's still the new year...

I have vacation time coming to me.

Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.

I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?

A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...

This is a Lifestyles hotel.

We're saved!

Couldn't we just have taken a train?

So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?

I never even got to be single.

Well, nobody can say we didn't try.

And then what, Faith?

That was really sweet...

So, you've had a little bad luck.

Who said I was going?

Amazing...

Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.

Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".

No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.

Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?

This is the last one before the wedding, right?

And we didn't have to bring another present?

It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.

I came after the woman I love.

And you didn't tell her?

It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.

Mmhmm.

Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.

Wow... .

It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens This bum Wilson he gets the title shot outdoors in the ballpark!  and what do I get a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.

It was you, Charley... .

How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me who?  -- who?

They're waiting for him to walk in.

Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?

I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.

The Golden Warriors.

How do you like that one?

If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.

It's quite  nice.

A dive? You mean, into the water?

Terry!

And when things get in your way or people you just knock them aside get rid of Them is that your idea?

What are you crying for?

Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.

It's true.

Pigeons... .

I don't want to hurt Charley I don't want to hurt you...

I know what you want me to do!

Edie...

Thanks just the same.

But I feel like My friends won't talk to me.

Every one of 'em... .

Then go ahead go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.

You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.

A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you hadthe only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .

Where you goin'?

But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .

D 'n D?

Nice fellows.

So help me God!

Waterfront Crime Commission ?  What's that?

Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.

A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!

You was a Golden Warrior.

Is Johnny in?

You ought to go home and take care of that

Hey, Skins  --get away with that sheet metal all right?

Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.

Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.

Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung!  You should have  You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business.

You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.

Go on beat it. Don't push your luck.

From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .

You got some nerve.

A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?

A banana boat. It would be bananas.  One of these days me ship's comin' in from Ireland,  God love 'er, loaded to the gunnels with sweet Irish whiskey!

The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.

You don't think he'd be helpful?

But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?

Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.

They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>

That sudden?

Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.

I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.

Well?

When!?

I understand, Master

Oh, if there is only time!

I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.

Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!

That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?

You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.

Glenn Michaels.

He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?

Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together.

You were his what, his box?

I'm not dressed.

I don't know where he is.

Go away, or I'll call the police.

I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.

Just that she got away.

Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.

Jack?

So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.

Nice disguise.

Whatta you think?

No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.

It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?

So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?

Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.

You find out?

What?

I'm going back inside.

Hello, Daniel.

Isn't that my report you're holding onto?

I have to qualify, is that it?

Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?

Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.

That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.

Karen, I told you not to--

How much for your company at chow?

Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.

Like being back in the yard, huh?

Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.

Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.

Boy, it stunk in there.

How many was that?

We still talk, though.

You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.

That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.

And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...

You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.

Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.

None of your business.

How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.

Think I could have them back?

Why not?

Unless you wanna tell me.

One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.

You did?

Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?

It's your game.  I've never played this before.

If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?

I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.

I wasn't sure you caught that.

You know I saw you on the street.

No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.

You coming back?

I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.

You're not dumb.

If you don't, one of those guys will.

I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.

You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!

Weren't you expecting us?

I thought you guys were busted.

You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.

Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?

My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.

I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.

Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.

Foley?  That you?

You busted out?

There were others.

And so now you're off to Glades.

And is Foley a part of this?

You there?

Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.

Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.

It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.

How's it going?

I can tell.

What'd you fight, middleweight?

Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.

Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?

I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.

Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.

How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?

What are you thinking about?

Was it Foley?

Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?

Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.

So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.

I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.

You here all by yourself?

In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?

Did you pay the guy the reward?

That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.

Faux goose down.

Midge.

White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?

I think he must've fell in.

What, good-lookin' sumbitch?

We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!

Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.

I wish she could forget him.

You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.

Nervous?

Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.

Too late for apologies, Walker.

Shit, he's puking on my feet!

They ready, Earl?

I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?

I didn't mean it.

I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.

It's tight.

Land of the free.

I'm out of ammo!

We've always tried to beat each other.

So beautiful!

There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.

I heard what you did.

I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.

Win?

Oh, this is Betty.

Danny's not coming?

Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.

There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.

Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.

What else can we do?

Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.

We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.

If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!

I have'na been able ta --

You have something to say, Yamamoto?

Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.

It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.

1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.

You should have left here years ago, like I did.

Lucky lady. Hi.

Can you believe I want to marry that dork.

I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.

Peggy Sue!

We're here on the sofa bed...

You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...

How do you feel?

How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?

Yeah. Like that.

You really love me, don't you?

Charlie, let's make love.

Charlie. About last nights..

Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.

Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.

I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...

Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love  Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?

Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.

Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.

Just take a look at it. 

Forget it, it'll never work.

Oh, Charlie.

. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...

God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.

Are you for real?

Terry, slow down.

Terry! Slow down.

If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.

You don't?

This is great reefer.

The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.

A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.

No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?

Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...

If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?

Damn that Charlie I

Thank God for that.

Hi, Dad.

I closed my Christmas club.

But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.

He'll win.

Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightheaded.

Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.

I'm excused.

Who was that man?

Would you get that, dear?

That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.

I'm not the maid!

You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.

What are you doing?

You think this'll cheer Dad up?

I remember that dress.

I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.

Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?

The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a foureyed worm.

I guess part of us never really leaves high school.

But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?

What're you doing?

Silicon is from sand.

No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.

Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.

I came to say goodbye.

Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.

No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.

...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...

I hear you moved into town.

Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--

What?

I hope he doesn't have rabies.

Zowie...

This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.

Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.

How can he not have a heartbeat?

What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?

You ever think about running away?

Mom...

What in God's name... ?

Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles.

Thanks, you guys.

Aren't you giving an exam?

You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?

What's wrong with you?

Whatever.

We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.

... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.

Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!

Innocuous?

Client of yours?

Jesus Christ, what happened to you?

Congratulations.

Kids are great.

Correct. I'm seeking representation.

I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.

The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...

Who'd you get?

PARRTYY!

I'm a law suit.

You think I'm uncomfortable...

Beckett?

He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.

Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.

In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?

Do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?

Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.

In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?

Do men have sex with each other in that theater?

When? Approximately what year did this event take place?

Do you need a break?

While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?

In some situations.

And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.

Gillman says I'm fine. My blood work is excellent. T-cells are up. Just a sec ...  Yes, I think that would alleviate most of our concerns.  My platelets look good too.

Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?

I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.

And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.

Leave that.

It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?

According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?

And I hate to rush you out of here, but...

Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.

Good school. What year?

Great.

Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!

Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?

Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?

Since when?

Yeah. Do I have a case?

Yeah. But we took care of him.

If it please Your Honor, we <u>hope</u> to settle this matter.

This would be a good time to break for the day...

Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?

He was doing a great job.

I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...

Gonna lose everybody out here....

Probably okay to talk to me now.

Bottle-count.

Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!

I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..

<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.

'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.

Just give me your hand.

You'd die for them?

Christ, you don't know what's out there!

What?

Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.

No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --

Nobody else is going down but me, okay?

Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --

Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --

Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --

You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.

You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --

Not a problem unless you're gonna make --

So you noticed too?

Fry?

I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.

Hasan?

The sled as a shield....

What're you doin'?

We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....

So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.

Very big beads.

I'd rather piss glass.

Such as.

Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?

Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?

Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.

What's her name, anyway?

So much for your nightfall.

Not a star-jumper.

I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.

Seal the cave?

Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.

Do you have to work tonight?

Look -- she remembers.

But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.

Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.

You didn't think so then.

Well, maybe they're not.

Got your sensors?

You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.

Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.

Landon! Join the expedition.

Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?

If only we could get a fix.

Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?

Who are you?

Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?

Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?

Lucius.

Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.

'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."

How so?

What about me?

A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?

Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?

Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.

You want her that much?

It's humiliating.

Would you like to come along?

Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.

Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?

WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!

Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...

Listen to that shit, that's good shit!

You lame Taylor?

Where's he from?

Baaa, got no time to go to the movies. Love and Hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul.

Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...

Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...

La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!

Come on man!

...I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.

Yo getting there Taylor. You be cool now and I'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.

Hey that's great King, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King... got your address right? You know where you can reach men, man. Anytime!

Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.

I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.

You wanted to see me sir?

Right...

No thanks, I've seen Seattle.

Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.

A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?

How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.

What's the matter?

We have some nice places around Vancouver.

I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.

Good evening, Miss.

You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.

Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.

No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..

You're drinking it.

Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.

I know it's a littler late for an apology.

He was a great boy for that. What else?

Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.

They're going to arrest me.

There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.

You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.

I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.

Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.

Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.

It buys things, just like any other kind.

No.  I paid him off.

I think you mean that.

You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.

I'm sorry.

Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.

We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?

This isn't a very good place to talk.

Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichés, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?

So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.

I can't answer that.

What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.

Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.

He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.

What are your rates?

I stick around and wait for the five hundred.

I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.

Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?

Who told you my name?

It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.

That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.

Thank you.

How are you two getting along?

Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.

Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.

So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.

So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.

The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.

And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't

Send that?

What's the face for, Driscoll?

It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.

You in charge here?

Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.

That's pretty risky business, Inspector.

Not too hard, is it?

Was that about the right angle?

You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.

Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.

You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?

I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?

You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.

I am a fool.

Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!

It does.  May I go now? 

I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?

No.

It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?

Well, find out.  Who's covering her?

Ye have, have ye?

Get out of here!

So-so.

She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?

You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.

I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.

How long have you had it?

It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.

Of course.

Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.

He's a little unhappy.  I hope he wasn't a nuisance?

It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.

To Ann.

It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.

The references are to Hansard or to newspapers.  I haven't got the actual speeches now.  You'll have to chase them up.

Shall we go?

Thank you.

Now first of all, tell us your name.

How's Mary?

No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?

Aha.  James giving some woman the old heave-ho.

Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?

Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.

Are you going to have coffee?

Oh, but he was terrific.

No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.

Oh yes?

You don't trust me.

I think we're ready now, thank you.  And how was Norfolk?  Did you get on with my mother?

Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?

Blasé and epicene.

And the Argies.

Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.

Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--

She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.

It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...

Hold those rights.

Perhaps I will, then.

Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?

Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.

Susan and I are very old friends, James.

Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?

Hello, Jimmy.

I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.

Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.

Now, are you going to have some more tea?

Jeremy!  How Fantastic.

We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.

What have you got there?

It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.

It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'

Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.

Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.

How you figure?

Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.

I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?

We gonna jump or jerk off?

Don't screw around man, pull it!

You gotta tell me where she is.

Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.

And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.

You never were...

All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...

How was the beach?

Surf conditions okay?

Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?

Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?

Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.

Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?

Sorry.

Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?

Johnny, it's the only way.

They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech.

I think you gotta hit them straight on!

Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?

I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?

Got it.

... so I started tailing him.

Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.

Time for lunch.

Nothing?

Angelo!  Don't fire!

Meaning you were expendable.

Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.

I... I gotta go.

Ouch.

So what'd the other guy look like?

Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?

Bye.

Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?

Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.

I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?

I can accept that, it comes with the job.

You're wastin' your time.

Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...

What's got Billy so spooked?

Took 'em out with a heat seeker.

Major, you'd better take a look at this.

How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?

Georgia.

Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.

Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.

You don't know anything about me.

The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --

Congratulations, sir.

Who are you going after next, sir?

What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price.

What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.

Mr. Harris.

You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.

What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?

No, you look like a hooker.

Mind if I turn on some heat?

Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.

What's your name, lover.

Always.

You really are a very beautiful girl.

Where'd you go?

By breaking up a company's assets --

Not... quite.

Where'd you learn to do this?

I'm not just talking about sex.

Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?

This isn't a date.

You're upset, huh?

Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.

I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.

What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.

Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?

Do I look okay?

What if someone tries to steal it?

To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...

Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.

If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?

What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?

It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.

Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!

I got tired of hating my father.

You're packing.

Aw, don't... no...

Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.

I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.

Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.

Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --

Doing what?

Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.

Did I wake you?

I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.

I don't think there's any sense in --

You spent it on drugs, didn't you?

Carlos had some great rock.

I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?

Looks slow tonight.

You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?

Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.

I'm just going to my room.

I'm -- I'm with a friend.

What is it, Miss Vivian?

I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.

What?

Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.

He knows I do not love him.

I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.

I fear I'll never see you again.

But how can you be sure?

I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.

I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.

Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.

Why is that, do you think?

Faster!

You be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.

-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --

The Man in Black?

It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --

Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --

Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.

You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.

For the last time -- SURRENDER!

I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.

-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it

There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.

And it is guarded by sixty men.

No.

-- yes --

I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.

True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.

Slow going?

I do not suppose you could speed things up?

But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.

Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.

You're amazing!

But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.

Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.

I accept.

Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.

You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --

"True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --

A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --

Think it'll work?

Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!

"Of the silvery mooooon,

Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.

I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?

It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.

Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.

What was I saying?

Assume away!

What do you mean?

So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.

But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.

Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.

Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.

What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?

Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.

Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.

What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?

Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?

What kind now, Leo?

You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.

I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.

Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.

How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?

But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.

What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?

They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!

Don't help me.

That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!

Vaaaat???

Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.

You, Blum go Motel.

Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.

So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.

Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.

Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.

I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?

Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.

Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.

Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?

What did you tell the people?

I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.

Very early. Dawn.

No.

No.

Of course not.

There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...

Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...

I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.

Forty thousand dollars.

Did he say anything about my sister?

Is something wrong?

Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.

Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...

I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...

I ought to call the police right now!

It's been three.

You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.

Stay here.

I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...

I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.

Huh?

You going to wait here for me?

We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.

There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!

That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...

I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...

Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?

I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.

I can come down next week.

Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.

You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.

Hey, we can leave together can't we?

We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway.

Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 

I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.

There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.

I've caused you some trouble.

You eat like a bird.

I'm looking for a private island.

Why do you ask that?

If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.

She sounded strong...

Except you.

You're not going to... to your room already?

Alright, Miss... 

No, m'am.

Frankly, yes.

In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...

Mary is Lila's sister?

Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.

Norman took a wife?

You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?

Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!

Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...

And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?

Just before she died she came to--

Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]

He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.

Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.

No, I don't want money. I only want to find out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not taking their money.

Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?

Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.

Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.

I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.

Oh, I see. Cats' fur.

Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.

What's down there?

What is it?

You're losing your blood?

What were you dreaming about?

Your father?

But you were in on it -- you worked for him.

You lie!

What are you laughing at?

I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?

There's no hurry. It's early.

You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?

If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.

Why, certainly, sir. My fiancée. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.

But why? She's the best friend I've got.

Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.

That's the way I feel about it.

But I think these things are beautiful.

Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?

Meaning what?

And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.

You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.

I am right! I know I'm right!

Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.

Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.

What do you mean?

You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?

I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?

Make it snappy, Colonel.

Don't give this to anybody else, will you?

Fine, thanks.

He might get some publicity out of it.

Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.

Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.

I told you I didn't want to mix in it.

Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?

--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.

Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!

If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?

To lunch.

But I have some friends waiting.

Could be.

She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --

I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.

Why?

Who would want to do such a thing as that?

I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.

I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?

He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.

He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!

Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?

Son, was Rose in your room last night?

What do you think, Brother?

The new girl is here.

Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.

Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?

Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?

Uhhh, gahdam stuff!

It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.

Wow! Brrrother!

Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.

Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.

It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.

What's goin' on?

Are they polar bears, too?

Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.

How could that be, son?

You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.

That's what she would say herself.

It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.

All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?

Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?

How goes it, darlin'?

Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.

Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.

They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.

I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.

But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.

Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?

Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.

Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?

I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.

I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do.

If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.

It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.

This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.

It's twenty after one.

Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,

Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!

Goddamn you, girl! You've made me make a fool out of myself, damn your hide, but let me tell you I am standing at the pass of Thermopylae and I won't budge! The very idea, my own home with children in the house, to say nothing of my wife -- oh-h, you had better believe I am standing at Thermopylae, you little nut, you had better believe it! What are you, crazy? A man is supposed to be a fool like this, but a woman is supposed to have some control and sense! Are you a nitwit? What's the matter with you?

Is anything wrong?

Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?

Ohhh-hh, ohhh...

I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.

I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?

There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!

God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.

Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job!

Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!

Your baby?

Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.

Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.

She didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to Winston-Salem. It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. Little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now?  A kike. That's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named Schapiro out in Seattle, who's got the nerve to have the same first name I got. Wouldn't you know it, Rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike? She was always out of her friggin' head and I'll tell you why.  Buddy, she was sick in her mind and between her legs, too. She was a nymphomaniac.

I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.

Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.

Afraid of the hospital?

A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?

It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.

We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.

Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?

I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?

I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.

What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?

It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.

Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?

Yes, Ma'am.

Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.

I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.

I don't want to go to the dentist.

I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!

Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.

Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.

I was going to tell him.

Let me tell him.  Let him decide.

What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.

We'll take the CalTrust heist, but if it's no good, we will hunt you down, and Billy-Boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it.

Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!

Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.

Make a hole, Billy-Boy.

Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?

What about him?

What day is it?

Where we going?

You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.

Hey...

Okay.  But, what changed our mind?

Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.

You live like a pig.

I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?

Maybe.

And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!

Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!

What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?

Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.

You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?

Pure horse.

Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?  Some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.

Yeah... great.

I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...

Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.

If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.

That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.

You put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...

How'd we do?

Come again... ?

You suck at lying, Archie.

Think Zimmermann's watching?

You John-Wilkes-Booth-ed him.

Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.

All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.

We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.

At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.

I can't do it, Ben.

The other he spoke of is your twin sister.

Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.

Your eyesight will return in time.

Yes, my Master.

As you wish.

What is thy bidding, my Master?

I have felt him, my Master.

Wouldn't miss it.

You got her warmed?

Vader's on that ship.

Hey, are you awake?

Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.

Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.

Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.

What are you telling them?

I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.

All wings report in.

Oh!

What's he saying?

Over there! Two more of them!

What do you remember?

Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?

Do you have any tattoos Brad.

You!

Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.

You promise you won't tell?

Yes.

Yes Brad.

Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.

But it seems so unhealthy here.

I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.

Brad...

Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...

Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.

Maybe we could try it this way.

You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never

Was all I had to say

Dealing

No no no no.

Are you - giving a party?

Who's Eddie?

But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.

...How's the turtle food this week?

It's Thanksgiving.

...Aren't you skating?

It's all right -- You're my guest.

They're all the same.

Would ya take off your glasses?

...T-thank you.

...What?

It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --

...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.

I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.

I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.

...That boy damn near broke my arm.

Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.

No doctor!

Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.

Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!

Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!

Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!

Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.

Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?

Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.

'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.

Six!

...How 'bout for the Cokes?

Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --

I say ya nothin'!

You can forget about sparring, kid.

Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.

What's ya name again?

What about for food an' stuff?

...The juice is climbin' every week.

Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay?

Mr. Balboa --

Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?

'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.

...What?

Do you see me talkin'? Huh?

Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?

How old are ya?

The legs must be goin'.

...Who'd ya fight?

I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.

How 'bout a glass of water?

...What?

Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.

Don't you care what the people will say?

How you holdin' up, kid?

Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?

I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.

Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.

I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.

I'll do okay.

Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.

How ya feelin'?

I got whiskey here.

How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.

Ya really like her?

To see ya train.

So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?

My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.

What's this, Roger?

Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.

A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.

Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.

So what's the scam, Eddie?

Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?

I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.

He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.

Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.

Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?

These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.

Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?

Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?

You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.

Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.

Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.

Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...

When will I hear from you?

Maybe.  Why?

You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?

You got the will in there, don't ya?

Pattycake!  Pattycake!

My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.

Aah!

What the hell are you doin'?

Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.

Does this help?

How do you know that?

But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.

Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?

Say, who's this guy laughin'?

You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.

Wrong number?

What the hell are you doin' in there?

That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.

No, kid, you're a real hero.

More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!

Out of her favour, where I am in love.

Farewell, my cuz.

Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.

What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.

'Tis he.

Uncle, 'tis a shame.

Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.

Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.

Goodnight.

I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!

O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?

Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.

Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.

O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!

A most courteous exposition.

I will follow you.

Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?

O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.

This is important.

I don't know.

Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.

Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.

When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.

Not to me, you know that.

About time!

And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.

Now, what did we steal?

Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.

Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.

Who are you?  IRA?

That fucking figures...

Shut up!

If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.

Where's my information?

Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.

I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.

We'll die if we stay here!

Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.

Then where is it?

Is it done?

Gregor, is that you?

It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.

Then I guess we're set.

Hello, Jean-Pierre.

Are you sure you won't have a drink?

Yeah.

Yeah, well...  My way works too.

What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.

You should watch what you eat.

I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.

Perhaps the police?

Cigarette?

Pretty much what you'd expect.

What'd you say to him?

That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?

What's the difference?

So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.

Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.

Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.

I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?

They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.

I needed to know.

How did you know?

No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.

And what job is that?

Clearly.

The Irish representative?

You sure your friend got the right place?

Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.

It is at that.

How could you have done that?

I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.

No you don't, and you know it.

Do we need anything else?

Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.

The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.

You speak French.

Do you have the tape?

I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!

How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?

Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.

He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.

Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...

Oh, you would have done great.

Call it in I guess.  Why?

Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?

That's right!

All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?

I've got one condition.

I don't know...

I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...

Well, we didn't know that at the time.

No we didn't.  He died on his own.

I could kill that no good son of a bitch!

Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.

Well what are we supposed to do?

How long is it going to take?!

It's gonna be o.k.

Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...

Do you have everything?

What happened?  What's Earl doing here?

You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.

Listen Earl.  I covered for you. For both of you.  I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!

Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!

You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!

Whoa, Earl!

Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?

Yeah?  So?

Sally?  I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.

You got me something?  What's the occasion?

That son of a bitch.

You're worth every last penny.

He started digging through my closet, something he never does.

Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...

So do I.

I don't know, Booth.

We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.

Yeah, I've seen him.

I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.

Be more specific.  A month, a week...

He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.

Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.

Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.

Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.

Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.

Just goes to show you.

Very clumsy, very clumsy.  Id have found it in a minute.

Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?

Why?

Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock, didn't I?

Hey where's the hot pad?

Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...

You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!

We're out of here.

What do you mean?  You gambled it?

Oh Jesus Christ...

You want to see how more unglued I can get?  Try me.

Are you hungry?

Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.

Don't you want it?

He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.

Yeah.

It's nine-thirty in the morning.

The band has been playing over an hour.

San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.

It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.

How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?

Would you like me to tell you how your father died?

Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.

Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.

You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.

That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?

Carter, get off that stage!

What'd I say?

All I wanted was a little mu-shu.

I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.

Carter?

Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.

He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.

No, no, that would be crazy --

I thought you'd think it was crazy.

I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...

Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?

What's she doing?

Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.

Pick it up!

Let me see it again?

They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.

Are you okay?

She saved our lives.

See you in the next world.

How was the sex?

That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.

Very nice.

You've been a good friend, James Carter.

Red Dragon.

Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!

No you didn't!

Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.

They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.

I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?

What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?

Do you still have the bills?

We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.

If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.

A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.

The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.

Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.

And that, of course, would be me.

Beach Boy.

You have one of these?

You speak English!

Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.

I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.

-- what the hell is that?

I thought you were taking me to the consulate.

I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.

I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.

Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?

When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?

What?

Let's go.  Everybody take off?

That's not how it goes.

No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!

What?!

This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.

No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.

What are you doing here?

Oh my god. Griffin.

Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?

You're killin' me here.

Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.

Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.

Yeah, if you're Superfly.

How about a lift home?

How much they want?

What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?

You understand what I'm sayin'?

Yo, Johnson...

Hello.

I would like one of my people to help.

Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.

I am so sorry about your men.

Got any last minute advice?

And in a "V".

Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.

Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.

Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.

I have no idea what I'm doing.

You could have told me you were fiance number three.

It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.

Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...

Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?

Yes, I am.  And who are you?

Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --

Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...

I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...

You're going to be very disappointed.

Really?

Give me that!

You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?

My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.

You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?

Five hundred.

It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.

No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.

I'll have the same.

Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?

It's valuable.  Hang onto it.

Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?

Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.

Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.

I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.

To who?  Are you asking me?

Yes, you!

You were not.

Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.

I'm going to kill myself.

Thank you.  You still think that he was....

I'm really rooting for this one.

You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.

You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.

I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.

Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --

Your Uncle Milton lost all his money in a Puerto Rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the IRS or the Federal prison system.  Your mother is Barbara, your father is Cliff --

Happy New Year, darling.

We'll stay at the Plaza --

I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?

I told you.  Nothing --

Oh!

"Sleepless in Seattle"?

Men never get this movie.

Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?

Hello.

What?

I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.

Did you talk to him?

You told a lie and got on a plane.

No.  That's the weirdest part about it.

So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.

You're going to miss the train.

What are your plans in New York?

She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.

Maybe you should see a shrink.

Everybody! Annie has an announcement --

I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.

You know.

I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --

Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?

Hello.

Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.

We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...

What was it that made you know?

Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.

You'll see.

You'll like it.

Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?

Eighty dollars.

Dad?  About last night?

Dad, I don't know about this one --

Does red pepper go under R or P?

What?

Fine.  Fine.

Sure.  Looking good.

Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?

How did they get our phone number?

"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?

This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --

She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!

This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?

In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.

Jed's got cables.

Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 

Why is she bringing that bag?

What are you doing up?

This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.

God, she's beautiful.

What's wrong with Annie?

Did too.

I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?

I can't believe you flew first class.

Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.

Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.

Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.

You're kidding --

You're welcome to one.

Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.

Take a drink. Calm down!

It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.

Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.

Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.

Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?

Mama, can I put the candles ...

Why are they singing, Mama?

So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.

We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.

But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen

This water's cold again.

We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.

First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.

Now don't start talking against the union again.

Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?

I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?

A fighter, huh?

Let them take it!

Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.

I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.

That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?

Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.

It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.

You mean you're ready to give up?

Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.

Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.

That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.

What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?

But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.

Ramón -- listen my kids ...

My kids don't have enough to eat!

Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.

No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.

Bobby?

What?

Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.

They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.

Ride 'em cowboy)

I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes.

I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.

I ain't a idiot, asshole.

How?

What?

Fuck you.

That's long enough to get out of town.

There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.

I need my paycheck.

You're good, princess. I'll give you that.

Who is it?

Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?

I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.

Where to?

Nice day

Don't get carried away.

A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...

Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?

Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?

Danny?

What the hell is that?

This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?

Nah... I want to keep it.  Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?

By not disgracing her memory!

I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?

I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?

I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.

Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.

Cool it. We got business.

What?

Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.

You think I'm a Judas?

You don't find that repugnant?

I was getting to it.

If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.

Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.

What're your taking down?

That's because he doesn't have one.

Murder.  Beautiful.

Please ... don't do this ...

I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.

What's on the other end of this thing?

Excuse me?

Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?

You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.

You, madam, are a heartless wench.

Really?

Tom, let's spend the night here.

First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?

Just no pleasing you, is there?

And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.

Report.

Resistance?

Casualties?

Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.

Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.

So, that's Ryan.

He ain't Wade.

Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.

Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.

Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.

We left them eighty-eights.

Not yet.

You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.

Upham?

Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.

What is it?

I wonder where they're going.

Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.

Captain, what about our deal?

GO!

You?  Leading a squad?

What about the company?

A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.

You think they'll be alright?

I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.

HOLD YOUR FIRE!

Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.

And how do you bluff yourself?

There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.

Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.

I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.

I'm listening, sir.

I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.

Any further thoughts on the subject?

Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.

Scans the Germans with his binoculars.

Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.

Maybe Caen.

Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.

I wonder if his cabin is still available?

FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.

Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.

The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way.  You hear me, Private?

Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.

Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.

Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.

Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.

Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.

I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.

Pardon me?

Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?

I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.

Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.

I'll be in my office.

Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.

I don't feel anything.

I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd.

Why?

Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?

You like it?

What are you doing?

God, that's... this is ridiculous.

What?

Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!

God, I'll have to go on a plane.

Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?

So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream.  I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.

Oh yeah.  There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream.

You're not listening to me.

Do you love him?

Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.

Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.

Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.

Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.

Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?

Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...

Hello.

Mom, please?

I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.

You will?

Thank-you.  The real world.

Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.

Whoah, what a day, huh?

Yeah.

Quick question - do you know who I am?

Are you busy on Friday?

I'll go.

Eight. Eight O' clock.

So we can finally talk?

Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.

I only have something like sixteen weeks.

Nice one.

Oh.

Okay, bye.

It's okay, everybody does that.

You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.

Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?

Are you comfortable?

Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.

Why didn't you tell me?

Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?

I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.

Then don't do it.

What do you want?

One more time would be nice.

Okay.

No my brother, you have to go buy your own.

Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?

Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...

Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.

Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.

Oh boy.

Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?

It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?

Oh, I was just going to...

Certainly.

Oskar - my friend Lena.

You know what, you'd like her.

It's not a charade, all this?

Should I stay?

All right, okay, let's talk.

You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.

It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.

What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.

What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?

Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.

What's that?

So I'm responsible for the weather?

This is not my problem.

Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?

Hey, Poldek, how's it going?  You know about the list?  You're on it.

Like this?

Oskar, good of you to come.

Thank you.

He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -

He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.

I was just the accountant.

Jews, yeah.  Investors.

I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.

What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?

Better this month than last?

You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.

They arrived.

I'll talk to you later.

I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...

If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...

It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.

A one-armed machinist, Oskar?

How's the name search going?

We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.

I heard a noise.

Outside.

Don't do that. Hang up...call...

Hang up...call...

Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.

"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?

Why do you always answer a question with a question?

Hello? Ted?

Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?

Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room.

I did that.

Look, I'm sorry about the face.

How do you put up with this Greek shit?

I could use some therapy.

How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...

About what?

Why?

Yeah, were trying to send a message to Hollywood. Im really getting tired of all the happy endings. Its just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.

You weren't supposed to leave her alone.

He seemed harmless.

A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.

..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...

You have every right to be upset.

I never meant to imply...

Not good. How you doin?

Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...

Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.

Jesus Christ!

Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.

Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...

What do you want?

What do you mean?

No, wait...

Sidney. Hello. How are you?

I'm sorry.

Someones trying to kill me. I need the police.

Yes, goddammit!

He tried to kill her first.

Time to change numbers again?

Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?

What about rehearsal?

Who is that guy?

No, girletta, I don't leave your side.

We're missing the Sig Ep party.

It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.

The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...

Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.

Sid, I'll seeya tonight.

Hello?

She's not here right now.

I hate scary movies.

You ass.

Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?

I'll be right back.

There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.

No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.

I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.

Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.

You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.

What do you mean?

Where are you?

What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?

Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.

Alright Kincaid, no where to?

Please, call me Gale.

Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.

Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!

Are you sure?

Did you request this case?

Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.

I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.

That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.

I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it.

Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.

Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.

Yeah?

What about me?

Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!

Sidney, what happened?

What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.

Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.

Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.

Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?

Geez.

Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.

Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!

Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?

Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.

Gale he's got Dewey!

Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.

I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.

But you know my favorite name?

Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.

No.

Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?

Duh... that's quick.

Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.

Ready?

What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...

Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?

Billy? What the...

What are you doing here?

Close call.

It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.

And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.

Jesus, SHIT!

No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.

I'm so sorry... please understand.

Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.

Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.

I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...

Who did you call?

When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?

I thought you were...

It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!

Hello?

I don't think so.

Popcorn.

I'm getting ready to watch a video.

That's not what you said.

I have to go now.

Yes?

My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...

So you better leave.

I wanna play a game.

What kind of game?

Afraid not.

What door am I at?

I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.

Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?

What brings you out to these parts?

I like it. It's... sexy.

Did you reach my Dad?

I don't know. I guess.

God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.

Have they found my father?

It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.

I was first to respond.

There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.

He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?

Casey! Casey!

The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.

Many times.

Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.

He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...

So where are you?

Are you okay?

No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...

Jesus, this place is packed.

You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.

We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.

Why are they doing this?

Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.

You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.

Tell your mom I said thanks.

Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.

I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.

Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.

What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?

You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.

I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.

I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.

How is it working for a scumbag like this? You proud of yourself?

... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.

You've left unfinished business before.

It's none of my business anymore.

How you feeling?

What the hell's going on?

I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.

Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.

Here he comes.

Somerset...

There's a bucket here.

The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.

This doesn't make any sense.

It could be nothing.

This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.

Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.

The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.

Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.

He's preaching.

No witnesses of any kind?

What the fuck is that?

I wish I still thought like you.

You tell me.  I'm new in town.

Why would we?

Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I've ever had.

Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...

By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.

How do you know all about this?

Think about it...

By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.

Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.

What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?

Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.

You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...

Oh, you want to stay now?

No.

If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.

Put your gun down!!

I need you to look at each one carefully... very carefully.  Look for anything that seems strange or out of place.  Anything at all.

This painting...

I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.

I was close once.  It just didn't happen.

I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.

I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.

I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.

Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.

But Mose Harper said...

Lucy's going on seventeen now...

Let's get along...

Another one, eh?

Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?

Haven't seen you since the surrender.  Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender.

You ain't goin'...

They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.

Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.

I say NO!

If there's anything I can do, sir...

Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?

Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...

Well, the reward still stands...

Told ya, didn't I?

How'd you come by this?

Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.

Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...

Yes, sir.

Well, come on!

You want us to fire a shot if...

And you think we got a chance to find her?

He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...

Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...

Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...

Futterman?

That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...

Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...

Ethan, quit it!

Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.

How? She's even forgot her own language!

Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...

Comancheros...

They never find that girl.

Might at least have left me my pants!

Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!

I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...

But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...

Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...

Maybe the antenna's broken.

Hey... the fuse.

Do you know where fuse box is?

Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.

Cherry-red Tears.

I miss Tommi so much.

Now, what did I do to deserve this?

So, did you sleep good?

She was old.

Let me guess:  Another short circuit?

Martin, what-

Hello.  Can I help you?

Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.

Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.

I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew...

Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.

WillWhere is Mercutio?

Oh

Ah

Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.

Wait!  Will you desist!

What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.

We have no Juliet!

We will all be put in the clink.

Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?

The title?

I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.

I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.

What's the title?

But I have to pay the actors and the authors.

This time we take your boots off!

So what do we do?

Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!

Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.

Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!

It is over.

No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?

Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?

Cut round him for now.

Ethel.

His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.

Good luck with yours, Kit.

It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"

Two hours at prayer!

Like Valentine and Silvia?

As a nurse.

My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.

What do you love so much?

Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?

Will!

Master Shakespeare

As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.

I have, Master Shakespeare.

Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.

Anon, good nurse. Anon.  Master Shakespeare?!

Oh my lady, my love!

I do not know how to undress a man.

Even your play.

Oh, let Henslowe wait.

In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.

You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.

Nono.

At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the dukeOrsino.

Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .

I meanYour Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can

Your name?

Take off your hat.

Like a sickness and its cure together.

And her lips?

What of her bosom?

"Poet?"

Is there a man?

There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?

Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?

You learn that in your psychotherapy group?

About this guy, this Hugo person.

He made it clear.

I can't do it.

I won't be able to.

Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?

Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.

How much did you pay?

What's all this for, more security?

What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?

It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.

Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.

What?

Well?

Are you recording it?

It looks like he's writing everything down.

Well, is it?

Just one thing.

What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.

That's right.

Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?

When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?

Did you know --

God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.

Well, she had problems --

I will ask you once more, what sort of car --

Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.

I wonder how he did it?

No.

Who's going to do it?

Stop nagging.

Cameron. You remember Cameron.

No.

You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.

No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.

Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.

What?

I don't know. I thought maybe I was --

Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --

So, uh...

It's about the burglary.

No, not that I recall, I was asleep.

Two?

How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?

No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.

No, I've never seen them.

Why do you want a room here?

Would you like to talk about it?

That's what it cost, David.

Expecting anyone?

Yes.

But they sneer, don't they?

And that's why I think you fit in here.

Hello.

Here?.

It's nice.

What's it about?

No.

Writing seems easy.

It was some guy called Brian.

A little bit. Is that good or bad?

Working nights?

For what?

It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.

You can tell by the intonation.

Anyway, you remember Harold?

I don't know, I think...

Then what's the problem?

You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?

I just thought you'd like to know --

We cannot go into this later.

-- is that right?

-- is that what this is all about?

Thanks a lot.

Yeah, I think so.

I don't know.

And listen, I'll be right back and I want your ass in that bed when I get back.

I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.

What're you doing later?

Your husband?

Is she all right?

I know.

Hi.

Oh, no.

Did you hear me?

Yeah.

No.

You are.

Right now?

You do know what money's like these days.

I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.

Yes, Buffums.

You're late, George.

You do it.

I don't know. Probably not.

I'm sure.

Okay... but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?

She's incredible...  She loves you, George.

Why not?

It was after you, baby. After you.

You know what I'm talking about.

Sit down.

We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.

-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.

No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.

Where do you want to go?

-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.

-- good afternoon --

Why?

So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.

I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.

Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?

Oh yeah?

What with?

-- you shouldn't do me like that...

-- you know better...

-- yes, George.

Gunshots, there were some gunshots.

Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.

I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.

Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.

How are you, baby?

I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.

I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.

Yeah.

You've never even been around one.

Yeah.

George?

Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?

I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.

Right now?

What?

Television or movies?

Well that's something.

Baby, don't do this --

What? What? What? What? What?

George, now cut this out.

Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.

George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?

When?

Tonight?

-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.

It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --

Sit down.

I wanna hear about it, George.

That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.

Did they have something against me?

Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...

Have a drink.

Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.

Awww --

Come on by.

I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.

Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.

My secretary saw you with that boy.

It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...

They get hair all over the place.

George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.

Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?

Hi, Leonard.

Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.

I thought you said things were great with George.

-- Yesss?

-- uhh-huhh...

Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.

Oh. thank you.

Sort of.

Johnny!

Now I didn't mean that, you rat.

You're kidding.

-- there's not much room --

-- yes, Jill.

Do you have children?

Everything okay, son?

Are you having a good time?

Good.  I want you to have a good time.

I love you, Danny.  I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?

Now this is where we keep all of out meat.  You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers.  You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb.  Do you like lamb, Doc?

Why don't you want to talk about it?

Who's Tony?

It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.

Maybe he showed me something.

No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.

Yeah.

We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?

Jack...

Mom?

Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?

I won't make any noise.

Mommy...

Is Tony one of your animals?

No.

To my stomach.

Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?

Shall we go into the living room?

But eh what was the matter with him?

It's okay, really.

Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.

She eh... interferes.

It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.

Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?

Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.  Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?

Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.

Bill, how do you do?

What'll it be?

How's my credit in this joint anyway?

Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.

Perfect for a child.

I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.

I'm not being grouchy.  I just want to finish my work.

and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?

or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?

Did you find anything?

You went into the room Danny said - to 237?

Somebody did that to him.

Jack!

Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?

Stay away from me!  Please...

Stay away from me.

Stay... stay away!

Stay away from me.

I'll bring back a doctor.

I'm Jack Torrance.

How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?

Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.

It's amazing how much activity is going on today.

By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.

Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.

Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.

What's the money for?

Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?

Are you all right, Marty?

You booger.

Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.

I've been hearing noises in there.

Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!

Mom-!

You all right, Marty?

Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.

It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.

It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!

No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.

It could have been anything, Marty.

Yeah? Really?

What if I say no?

I come here because Marty needs a friend.

Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.

Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?

I think I hear it!

You know, I just might!

LET THY SPIRIT

SING!

Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?

Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?

I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.

For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.

Sure.

What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?

She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.

To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.

DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE

SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!

Like this place?

What?

Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.

Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.

Babies

She's a pro.

We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.

Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?

What?

A cigarette?

No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?

We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.

Bobs

I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.

The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?

BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME

A convent?  They put me in a convent? What's the problem?  Wasn't there any more room in Hell?

The reason?

I see.

Miss Van Cartier.

Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.

Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?

Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.

The vow of obedience.

And the vow of chastity.

As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.

It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?

What's wrong with my life?

It never solves anything.

I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!

So... hi there.

Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.

Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.

Please let me try.  I'm begging you.

A vote?

You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.

What are you doing here?

I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?

What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.

From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.

When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?

Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.

Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!

I am?

Really?  Lieutenant?

Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.

I can't go with you.

Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.

We could put you into our witness protection program.

I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.

But you didn't tell me!

He's so damn cocky.  This is different.

I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.

She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.

I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.

It should be here any minute.

We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.

She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.

Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!

We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.

But, Bishop...

But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.

I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.

She's a nun, Vince.

Hail, Constable.  How are you?

Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.

You must have missed your mark.

It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.

For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?

Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.

Wallowing in sin and lust...

Wallowing quite literally in blood.

May we look at them now?

Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.

He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.

Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?

The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...

Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?

What is that you wear?

Out there.  What do you see?

Thank you.

I hear nothing.

We are leaving.

We should not go much further in this murk.

Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.

There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.

What was she doing?

What now?

Other people?

My suitor?

I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.

To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.

Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.

Thank you.  No.  Here...

People have put their trust in you.

Must I hear this?

Blood.

When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.

Katrina...

It appears well.  It has already clotted.

I know you saw me.

Van Ripper, turn the coach about!

Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.

Thank ye.

Yeah, they's good all right.

All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?

Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.

That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.

He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.

How 'bout you, Jerry.

Did you decide, sir?

About a half a mile I think it is.

Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.

You know what we ought to do tonight?

Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.

He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.

Leave.

Leave.

Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?

I ain't sure.

Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!

You like that Vaughan?

I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.

We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!

What's all them books?

You believe in the Bible?

I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him.

But maybe just for awhile --

Don't you live somewhere?

They let you out?

This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off?

It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.

Where'd you get them flowers?

I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.

What do you mean?

Oh, jackin' off?

I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?

She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?

Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.

Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.

I aim fer you to have 'em.

Reckon what kind of a feelin'?

He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.

We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?

Huh?

Yes ma'am, I reckon.

I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.

Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?

I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.

She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.

I'll be.

Mustard's good on 'em to me.

Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?

Where'd he go? What's goin' on?

I don't think I've ever seen you before.

Do you have family here?

I done et just a little bit ago.

Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.

What's wrong? Is everything okay?

Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.

I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.

My name's Jerry Woolridge.

Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?

I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.

It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.

Is he leaving right this minute?

I didn't mean that.

What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?

I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.

It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.

Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.

How'd you get started?

A photographer ...

Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?

Slow down, huh?

Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?

It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.

It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.

Did you ever go back to see her?

You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.

Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?

Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.

Like what?

Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.

That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.

Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.

For keeps?

Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.

There's just one thing I want to know.

Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.

Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.

Sounds like another one of your stories to me.

You don't take anything seriously, do you?

I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.

A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.

No, it's five thousand dollars.

Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.

That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.

They don't come cheap, son. These little honeys are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical climate, most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on. Little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage. The smooth, delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another...

Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.

Is your name Paul Benjamin?

And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?

He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.

No thank you.

His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.

No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.

Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.

Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?

Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.

I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.

I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.

Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.

Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.

Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.

You still have that watch Auggie gave you?

So what's the time?

No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.

Well, if you put it that way...

That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.

Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.

People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.

I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?

Is that what you do? Draw pictures?

Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.

Where did you get that thing?

I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?

And?

The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.

Let's not get too idealistic.

I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.

If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.

Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.

Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?

Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.

Good thinking.

You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?

Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?

Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.

I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?

Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...

The battery's in, that's done with.  Besides, you'd do the same for m...

None.

Why?  If they could never take title.

Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?

Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.

Happy for him.  And relieved.

We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.

He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.

I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.

The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.

I can just feel my spirits soar.

There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...

My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...

I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...

You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.

I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.

They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.

It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.

And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.

And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?

Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.

You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...

<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.

Greedy.

I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...

And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?

As my wife testified, we were considering it.

I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.

How long you have this detail?

Here now, what are you fixin' to do?

It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...

This tastes horrible, hmmn?

Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.

He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.

You must think I like losing.

I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...

And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?

Does it now?

Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?

One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.

So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?

That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.

So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...

For certain, no.

Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...

Improved...how?

The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...

Wanna see my driver's license?

It's from Satchel Mouth at Table Seven.  This is from me to you, doll.

Yes, Sue?  What is it?

You're welcome.

You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?

Okay. 

Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.

It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -

We're not?

But suppose he loses?

But suppose it doesn't?

But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.

Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!

Right.  We have the same blood type...

No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.

We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...

We didn't see anything -  - did we?

You don't see any blood?

And it's so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.

I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.

Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.

DAPHNE?

Not there - that's the emergency brake.

Done what?

This way, Daphne.

What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -

Well, now you know how the other half lives.

Blow where?

What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?

With ME?

Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.

What are you doing with my flowers?

Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?

WHAT?

What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.

But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?

Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.

I'll say there is!

Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?

Like when?

It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.

Not that, you idiot.

Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?

Sugar?

Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -

OH!

That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.

It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -

I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.

I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.

And your head is hot.

And you've got cold feet.

I'm a very sick girl.

We better have a drink first.

See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?

Oh, I have some suntan lotion.

What do you think you're doing?

His yacht?

Did he get fresh?

What for?

Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?

If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.

Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me

Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?

My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.

This is my friend Josephine - she's going to be a bridesmaid.

The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.

Anything today?

Now look, Nellie - if it's about last Saturday night - I can explain everything.

Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?

Because I got some plans -

Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.

Me?

Rough?

Why not?

I wish they'd put us in the same room.

Your face is familiar.

Which one is yours - the big one?

Yeah.  Real hot.

So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -

You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.

Why?

Josephine.

Guess!

One of whom?

You heard her - yes.

Been waiting long?

Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -

Three?

Oh - in here.

It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.

A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?

Down the hatch - as we say at sea.

Where's your shell collection?

Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -

Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.

What else is there for me? 

I got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.

Really?

That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.

Tomorrow night?

Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?

You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -

Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?

Refresh my memory.

We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.

Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.

Just dropped in to pay my respects.

Too bad, Charlie.  You would have had three eights.  Goodbye, Charlie!

You know what I love about all this?

We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.

Hey.

You know all that if these walls could talk stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?

Wheres Nick sleeping?

Huh?

Id be happy to. Youre welcome.

Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.

Ill just check into a hotel.

I look like a total wanker, dont I?

Hey, man.

Hey, Kat.

Is this supposed to be an apology?

Hi. Hey.

What color are my shoes?

Dont patronize me. Theyve clearly been at this a while.

You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when theyre naked.

What does your gut say?

No, count it, anyway.

Not the way youre thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.

Sorry. Im a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.

You shit!

Yes.

Are you asking me if Im gay for pay?

Theres a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours.  Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?

When I said Id never done a wedding before, I didnt say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.

What would you do if you weren't an escort?

Hi.

You didnt have to do that.

Whats he do anyway?

Like fifteen.

Hey, Sal.

Im worried. Amys not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it drunker or drunker-er?

Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?

My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?

It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?

Did your mother know you were going to see your father?

And you say all them people is dead now?

They lived a long time ago -- before you and I were born.

Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?

Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 

Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!

I see you found what you was lookin' for.

He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.

Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?

When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.

Why, Daddy; you won't be here?

Into the clouds and behind the mountains.

From Miss Johnson --

But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!

Can I go day after tomorrow?

I wish you wouldn't take the dog with you, David -- he's likely to be a burden to you.

We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.

This is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you.

When you read it we'll talk about it...

Come, I'll take you home.

Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.

I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.

Whatcha got there?

Mama, what was we laughin' for?

I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--

Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?

There, you see?

No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.

That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.

The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!

Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!

Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...

Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'

Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'

Why the fuck not?

Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!

What is this?

-no Cheesy Poofs.

Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!

Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?

How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?

I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!

You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.

Come on, just get to the message board!

You guys! Seriously! You guys!

Eric?! Eric, what is it?!

What was that word, young man!?

What's the secret to making a woman happy?

You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?

What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!

No... The General is right.

Guess.

SHIT!

Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?

Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.

No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!

It's okay, I am done for.

<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>

Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?

Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.

How can they do this?

I thought you had something planned.

My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.

What about air strikes?

SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!

Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!

Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!

Article 42!  You don't mean-?!

How is the children's progress?

Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter!

Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.

Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.

I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.

Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.

<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>

If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!

Ow, you're hurting me!

We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!

Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?

Hi Wendy.

<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>

Got it.

I think we're moving.

Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...

Anna...

Jesus, come on!

Uh, yes I am.  And you are?

Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.

Were you going to give it to them?

Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.

You're certain of that?

Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.

You gotta think of your old age.

Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.

It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!

Barnes?

This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!

Is that clear?

What's the use...we're gonna die...

Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?

What are we going to do?

It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.

If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.

I can't let you do that.

You're ready for the real thing?

Taylor?

I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.

We don't have enough suits to get the others out.

Take this flare.

I'm not going with you.

And what are you going to do?!

Dawn.  Come in.

Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?

What the hell are you doing?

So close...

What is it?!

What is happening around here!!!

I'm going back for Taylor!

What the hell is that?

Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out.

You a mini-golfer?

Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?

Heh, heh, heh.

After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.

Yeah, basement bingo.

Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.

Bowling police, step back, give him room.

What's on your mind, Miles?

It's a beautiful thing.

Buzz Fazeli.

Need some advice, huh.

I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.

What the fuck is this?

Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?

No...

Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.

The whole world thinks you're underground.

What about bowling?

So, eh, you never saw me. Right?

Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?

I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.

You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.

My poor baby!

Hello?

He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.

What did you do to Buzz?

Junior.

Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.

You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.

Where's Junior?

Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.

Don't go near the bowling alley.

I just hold it loosely with both hands?

Like this?

Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!

Do those two work for your dad or mine?

I came here to have a word with your dad.

Kinda tough on the butt.

Can I ask you something personal?

Unfortunately what he wants is you.

Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?

You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.

And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.

I can't tell you, Theo.

I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.

These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.

You told Junior that we did it.

It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.

How do you get this thing down?

Can I come with you?

What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?

Fuck plan C!

Lips still for sale?

Some unfinished business.

Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.

You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.

... Your civil rights have been overridden!

The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.

Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.

A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.

Fifty yards and closing.

But you've tested it?

Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.

We're moving fast considering the storm.

A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.

A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.

Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?

-- dating the crash at least that old.

We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.

The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.

You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?

At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.

Wait a second --

-- I didn't know it would come to this --

He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."

Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.

Can you open that panel?

What caused it?

Subs are still at surface, sir.

Nothing, sir.

Ted?  Captain?

We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.

Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.

I have to tell you.  It's strange.

Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.

I'd also like it noted --

Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.

It's not talking, it's mimicking.

It won't register.  It's too big to image.

Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?

To the spacecraft.  To investigate.

400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.

Norman!

... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.

Yeah, it was awful.

Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?

You said something to him, didn't you?

Forget the sub.

Maybe you should go.  To the sub.

But I don't know how --

What's the matter?

... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.

What's Harry doing with your suit in there?

That wasn't in there before.

You don't believe me.

"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...

He translated it wrong.

Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.

Diphenyl parlene.

Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.

Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?

What is it, Norman?

The sphere looks different.

What was that?  I couldn't hear you.

What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.

Do you fear them?

Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?

Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.

Shut up, Beth --

I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?

Don't, Beth.

Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.

Beth!

Where is it coming from, Beth?

Stop it!

Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.

How's that?

He doesn't wait for an answer.

What are you looking for?

Where's it coming from?

C'mon, Norman.

Nice work, Norman.

Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.

Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?

You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.

Norman, where are you?

What do you mean?  She's not here?

We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.

That's right.

It's the squid!  Stop it!

How much time you figure to get to the surface?

Hold on.

Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --

You know how to work this thing?

The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?

Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.

English?

Do you?

... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?

Good idea, Ted.

Norman Johnson.

It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.

How are the others?

Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.

Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.

Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.

He wasn't feeling well.

You want me to try?

He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.

Try this one.

Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?

You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?

Was it a military crash?

Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.

We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.

Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.

Who are you anyway?

You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?

You saw through me?

I assure you my intentions weren't bad.

I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.

It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!

Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.

When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.

I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...

We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?

The Kiber Crystal.

That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!

I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.

As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.

There are only three or four left.

All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.

When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.

What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.

You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.

I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.

Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.

I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.

I am Luke Starkiller at your service.

First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.

You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...

I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.

According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...

I think we're going to need them. Blast it!

Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.

You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?

Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.

You rich kids... are all the same !

Our love will grow, dear, year by year...

Saddle up, Roughnecks !

Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?

You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.

I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.

I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.

I don't believe it !

Are you alright ?

It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.

Or...?

Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?

You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...

Well, whad'ya know...

I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...

Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?

Johnny, wait...

35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.

None at all... We won.

He's nothing like you.

Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...

I love you, Carmen.

I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?

...I'm sorry.

Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?

Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?

Hey, amigo, come chow with me.

Well, see ya.

Way to go, amigo !

Hey, Diz...

Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...

Oh, my, what's that ?

Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.

Mr. Rasczak.

I'm eighteen. It's my decision.

Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !

I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.

Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?

Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?

Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...

Best in the Fleet !

That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.

How bad are you, pal ?

Alright, we're gonna carry you...

Don't be a hero...

I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.

I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.

Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?

<U>Why</U>?!

Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?

Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.

The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?

A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?

To join, and become One with the Creator?

Yes.

We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...

Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.

That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 

I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.

Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...

Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.

I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?

One hundred kilometers...

Clear the bridge, Captain...?

Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...

I still contain fragments of my human half.

Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!

It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.

The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.

We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.

That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.

Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!

Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...

Child...!?

Has not, Doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not...

... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?

Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.

Dock control reports ready, sir.

Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...

Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.

He have any special dietary requirements...?

Go you Huskies?

I have one, but they lost it.

Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.

You haven't heard of it.

I quit.

That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.

But, but but but...

So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...

The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...

...who...?

They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?

What I need to <u>say</u>...

Uh huh.

"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."

...lost the screw...

Me, too.  You have a paperclip?

And here's some hydrogen peroxide.

Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?

Yes.

Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?

Ah.  Ah.  Ah...

Good morning.

I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...

We could live up here, live up in the country.

And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?

What is it all about?

I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...

Ten thousand dollars.

"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."

Hi!

We did...?

I have to tell you something...

I wasn't doing business.

I know em, I don't know what order they come in...

He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.

Big day last night.

<u>Wonderful</u> scr...

Wat...

<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.

I will.

Because, because...we don't <u>have</u> to build an Old Mill -- they <u>have</u> an Old Mill -- <u>yeah</u>.  It's on a stream -- that's where you <u>put</u> a mill.

That's right.

Then she wasn't in the car.  <u>Say</u> it.

...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...

...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...

Whyn't you learn your lines?

I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...

That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?

Mornin, sister.

Tell it with...

What I...

Are you Okay?

<u>Bobby</u>...

Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?

You do...?

You guys had better leave us a...

I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?

Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...

Aren't you ever in school?

What's his name?

But not that <u>way</u>...

That's my...

Will you help me out...?

This is Joe White.

"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."

You can't do what?

...<u>no</u>, they don't...

...I can't do it, Wally...

Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!

...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?

What?

Where you off to?

Aren't you supposed to set an example for people...?

...I just swore my life away, back in that...

Hi.

What's in the case?

Mmmm.  You have children?

Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...

You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...

He saw the accident...?

You told me they had an Old Mill here..

Town's out of lilacs.

...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...

Not now.

My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...

Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?

Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?

Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.

I know the feeling.

Grace...

I treated you like a son or nephew.

No, what is it?

How do they know that, you told them?

You didn't see it...

You cool the broad out?

Did you bring Bob's weights?

IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?

He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.

She wasn't in...you were al...

Wally...?

Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  It's the Mayor, he's saying...

Do something.

Where the hell have you been...?  It's...

I've got two days to get this house...

Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.

...not at all...

On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.

Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...

...the damn thing...

Where are we?

We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?

&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;

I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.

Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...

Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...

Look she's upset --

And don't tell her I told you.

We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...

I said...

He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.

This'll work, huh?

Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...

I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...

No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.

C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...

Your mom had to...help a friend with this...emergency?  And she called me. And we switched days.  Then, I got stuck on my shoot, and...

Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???

June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...

Oh, baby, I'm so sor...

Great.  Big ears, too?

Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!

...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --  We are late.  We are seriously late.  Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed --

Excuse me --

Poof!  You're happy now.

Rachel's job is she works.

Mommy?

ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!

Mommy's sick, guys.

Where Ben?

I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...

Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...

And when did that pass?

May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...

You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!

Are you here?

Rachel's not half my age.

Called him.  We set an ap...

I'm afraid she's going to walk.

I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.

Machines do not EAT message.

Yeh?

Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.

I have a snoop.

I'm sorry, I just...

And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...

You bet you are.

Oh, my God.

She's devastated.

And you said...?

The primo stuff is great for pain.

He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.

Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...

Hon, maybe your mom would like t...

It's the same choice you made.

Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.

You really didn't have to come, you know.  I'd have brought them straight t...

Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.

See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.

And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.

She likes a Stolie, no ice.

I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...

You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!

Why didn't I?

You ride with Annabelle...

Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...

The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.

I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.

And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --

Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...

We have the kids.  Next weekend.

Oh my God.  Are you serious?

They're my kids.

She's not gonna die.

She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.

Can we go sit somewhere?

That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.

Where you goin'?

I don't know what's wrong with that kid.

Marty, ignore him.

Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.

Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.

Hey, Scooby! How's it going?

Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?

Consuelo. Are you crying?

Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?

Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.

Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?

Maybe it's for the bestI mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrongPeople who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?

Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.

Why was he on Death Row?

I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.

I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening

We're not ready.

We're not ready!

Twinkeys!

But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.

What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?

Marcus...You'll write something better next time!

Get the hell outta here!

Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.

Maybe he's that one in a million!

I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.

I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.

You're not.

...gger.

Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?

Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.

I do.

Yeah. But not any more.

Yeah...So you're um...you're married?

Great. How old are they?

What for?

So like, yeahI caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviewsY'know, I figure I can always drop out.

Prnceton.

Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry...

Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?

I said I'll lead.

What now?

Let's move it we got company!

Cooper...

What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!

I have a lighter!

Came over the satellite.  We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.

Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.

Who's Ryan Cooper?

Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.

Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?

Good.

Get your men to do it!

War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!

Can I have a glass of water?

Possibly some coffee?

Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.

But, finally, one factor tipped the scales. We received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one.

This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!

That's nonsense, and you know it!

Then all you have to do is untrigger it.

Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?

They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.

On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.

You've wasted enough of my time, fella.

Go back to sleep, baby.

Does the threat board show anything?

May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???

I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.

Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.

Yes, sir.

Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.

As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.

Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.

What's the gun for, General Ripper?

Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?

That is correct, Major.

That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.

That about right?

What shall we drink to, sir?

I don't think so, sir.

Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?

I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."

Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.

Do you think we'd cheat?

Major, those are my boys out there dying.

Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?

General Jack D. Ripper, sir.

Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?

General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?

What's the target.

General, stick to the point, please.

Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.

We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.

Then this is it.

A through H is correct.

Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.

Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.

Okay.  Check these points.  Complete radio silence.  To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders, the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits.  The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114, which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got it?

Where'd they get you?

What does it look like?

In about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar.  Cross in over the coast low-level, continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary, and climb for bomb run.  Any questions?

Shoot, Lothar.

Primary circuit is live.

Release first safety.

Fusing for ten thousand air burst.

What happened?

Where'd they get you?

He's dead, all right.

Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.

I said that's the point!

There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.

Who's that?

We're on course, Major.  Just fixed our position on that river back there.

When they emerge, a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable, if they are moth-balled in advance.  I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years.

Mn-hm.

Um-hm.

Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?

We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.

It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?

Uh-huh.

Typical male.

Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?

It's really not about anything.

A cloud.

Your a nurse?

Yeah.

Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.

No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.

Stuck with what guy?

Pony's coming here to the corner?!

Jesus Christ.

Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?

Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?

She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.

Yeah.

No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.

Hey, man.

Tim...

Bullshit.

God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.

Ah, you know people there?

Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.

Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?

Am I fucking him?

Hey! Hey.

Hey, we're just having a conversation.

Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.

You're a drunk and an idiot.

Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.

Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!

Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.

Thanks. See man?

You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."

You could do it.

You rich?

Oh, me too. Middle-class.

Yes.

You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?

It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?

Hi.

What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.

Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.

Well, w-what happened?

Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?

No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.

Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?

You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.

No.

Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?

You know, this, what you're doing with your life...

Oh, it's very complicated, huh?

Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.

No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.

Your sure as hell right about that.

No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.

God, KAREN JOHNSON.

Um, because you didn't want to go.

So what do you wanna do?

Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?

My goal is to make art.

Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.

No, I don't.

Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.

What?

Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?

I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.

What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.

You did, huh? Good for you.

You really suck, you know that?

Hey, Pony.

Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.

Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?

The prom. That's funny.

Great.

Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?

Yeah, well, that's what I do too.

W-wait a minute, wait a minute.

George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?

Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.

Look, get down off my property.

Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!

Get off my roof!

I hope you're happy!

No, this has everything to do with you.

Is that your driver?

No, no, it isn't. It's cool.

So? What's L.A. like?

Yeah, come on, play it.

Jesus, Jeff.

I'm moving.

Me?

Yeah, I know what you're saying.

Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.

Tim?

Oh, How'd she get back?

Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.

Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.

Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?

Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?

I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?

So where are you?

Seriously? It's a great idea.

Why don't you go back to where you came from?

Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!

It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.

Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.

This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!

Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.

No.

... I don't know.  Probably not.

I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.

So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.

I sure do.

Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.

Jack, I think I should get a job.

It's all my fault.  I'm sorry I ever started this...

Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.

Hey, hey, hey.  C'mon you guys.  Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow.  Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars.

I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.

Hannah, we've...

You got that big retarded girl down there?

Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?

She did, did she?  How is the old girl?

Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!

I don't hate you.  I need your help.

What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!

Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.

It must be about that appalling script of hers.  What can I say to her? What can I say?

Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !

Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?

Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.

I've been hoping to run into you.

Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.

How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?

I was afraid of that.

It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.

You sure have.

Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it.  It's all yours.

I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.

Check.

Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...

Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.

Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.

Who's Norma?

I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.

I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.

Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...

Why not?

Hello, young fellow.

Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.

Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl

You're a writer, you said.

Are you or aren't you?

They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!

Of course it is.

Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.

The name is Gillis.  I'm single.

That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.

You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.

Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.

Shouldn't we wait for the others?

Hold me tighter.

You think this is all very funny.

What are the notes?

What's the matter with you?

Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.

Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.

What on earth, darling? It took you hours.

Where are my cigarettes?

Don't you want to come along, darling?

He must be quite a guy.

Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book.

You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?

Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.

Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.

See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!

That's a lie!  They still want me!

I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --

You are not dressed properly.

That's what I told them.

How is she?

What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?

How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?

Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?

You made her a star?

Joseph C. Gillis?

So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?

Got a title?

So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.

How's that about your being my friend?

Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.

Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.

Bring something to drink.

Paramount is calling.

If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.

I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.

But the Power Source, Zaltar.

Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?

Why did she have to show up now?

Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.

Home?

I don't feel like it right now.

That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.

You're alive! She didn't kill you!

Let me kiss you.

You're not afraid are you?

She said it wouldn't last.

There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...

That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?

It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!

Hey! Ethan!

A little.

Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.

I bet they do.

What is it?

Guess! Go on.

Why the empty cage?

Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.

Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?

Someone's chasing him.

Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?

I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!

I can't help it if men notice me.

Why didn't you tell me?

Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.

Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.

My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.

Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.

You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?

I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.

No plans for the weekend, Linda?

Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?

I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.

Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?

That was meant for me!

The Danvers. And two of your little friends.

You've run out of things to throw, Selena.

I'm free. I can never thank you enough.

Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.

What is this place?

...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."

Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.

You can use the wand.

What's that? Never saw anything like that.

Zaltar. Use the wand!

Goodbye...

What are you talkin' about?

I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.

I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"

You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.

And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.

No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.

The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.

He really was!

Well, aren't you excited?

I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.

Well...  Not quite like this.

Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!

Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?

Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.

It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?

But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?

The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --

Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!

Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?

You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.

How many sugars?

Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?

You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.

Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  You want to be rich, right?

Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.

Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...

It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.

That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.

Is this whitemail?

A computer.

I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.

Everything.

Yeah? How's it look?

Stone mutha.

But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.

How you doing down there?

Hey, you're perfectly safe.

Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.

You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!

Ricky?  Where...what...

And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...

Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.

If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!

How would you know?

I can't! It's out of control!

Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.

85,000 dollars.

Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?

That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????

Computers talk to other computers, right?

Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...

And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...

That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...

Yes! This time we got it right!

'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.

Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.

Where were you?

It's true. It's true.

I didn't think I wanted to.

Let's go to my place.

Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .

You do?

Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?

Gee. But --

Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?

A parka.

Well done, Miss Teschmacher.

Artemis? Do you read me?

You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --

And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?

And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.

DELETE IN CUTTING

OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.

Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please.  Wait, -- look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of...

No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.

He flies as well, then . . .

He has powers as we do . . .

So --  I hope you like it.

Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .

There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.

Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times --

I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.

Free!

You are master of all you survey.

But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...

I've never been in a place like this before.

My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?

Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.

Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.

He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.

Gee, I don't think . . .

I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!

You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.

You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.

No Paris?

Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.

Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.

Impossible? Why?

Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .

Is he for real?

But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.

I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.

But he's never there.

What's that?

Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.

Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.

Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.

The one Superman wrecked up?

Hey! He looks . . . normal.

We'll all fry.

What I need this for?

Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.

Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!

Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.

Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?

I'm not going anywhere.

Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.

You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.

But . . . how could you beat him?

You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!

It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --

Don't worry, Mom. I know.

I'd like to.

Not...gray.

Some people aren't the athletic type.

Stop him, Clark!

For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.

Is that what they're calling him?

Super...man. Hmmm...

Listen...thank you.

You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...

The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?

Again???

See?

Mr. Romance...

Meteorites!

Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.

Don't let me down.

You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.

I don't understand.

Oh. Why? does he live up here?

Will you abide by the Council's opinion?

Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.

The good lord works in mysterious ways.

All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.

I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton

Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -

They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.

No! You couldn't imagine -

Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.

I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.

How old are you?

What color underwear am I wearing?

Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?

Do you like pink?

Where do you hail from?

There.

But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!

Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?

It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --

Luthor  --

Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!

Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.

I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?

She's in trouble?

I understand.

Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.

Case?

That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.

They just finished supper.

I'll be back around nine.

I don't know.

What do you mean 'outgrown it'?

I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.

How is Nicole?  Is she around?

I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.

I stopped by the station a while ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could almost hear the kids inside.  There was a lawyer there.  He told me he'd gotten you signed up.  Is that true?

Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.

No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.

What do you mean?

What do you mean?

You've talked to Billy?

It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.

How was it?

Is this mine?

That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.

Nicole?

That's right.

I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...

They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.

There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.

Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'

DADDY!!!

News?

I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand.  I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.

It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.

Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?

How does the family survive?

This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?

You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?

What's so funny?

What's that?

Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.

He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.

Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.

Loretta...Sidney Falco...

Where are we running?  What am I missing here?

But of course...

Did she accept?

Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -

I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.

Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.

You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?

Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.

How is dear old J.J. by the way?

I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...

Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...

Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.

Why are you trembling, dear...?

You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.

Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.

Hello, Harry.

I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.

Well, what have I got?  Alimony to a pair of tramps?  They're of no concern to me.  It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again!

You're picking up my lingo, hon.

I'm not sure I can reach him in time.

I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?

I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.

What's this boy got that Susie likes?

Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...

Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms?  Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...

Bribing me again?

I don't think so.

Is Frank D'Angelo around?

You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you "interviewed"?

Do you still keep your key under the mat?

Yeah!

Who else phoned?

What's the matter?

Why me...?

That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"

Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!

If there's a funnier man in the world than Herbie Temple at the Palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing.  No, make that 'screaming'.  It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks. Probably see you at Twenty One tonight.  No, for supper, late. Right. 'Bye...

I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.

Jimmy!  This is a coincidence.  I am just going -

This is big, you know.  Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater.  With the boys.  Fred can call Millie and -

Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted.  He isn't perfect, but -

But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?

Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?

Steve, I...

No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!

Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --

Please... let... the kids... go...

Do you have bandages?

Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?

This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?

What does that mean?

Radical.

Where we going?

I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?

Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!

Everything.

Affirmative.

It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".

Torque wrench please.

"No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."

I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!

This is tactically dangerous.

Is it dead?

So she's pretty cool, huh?

Out of the way, John!

I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.

I love you.  I always will.

They took him from me.

I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.

But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.

You broke my arm!

You look like handmade shit.

Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.

The CPU from the first terminator.

Is it safe for them here?

... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --

Oh! And don't wave your hands about!

And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.

Don't see me to my door, there's no need.

When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?

I guess so, sir.

So, what does the Russki want?

Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.

Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwängler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.

Can I ask you a favour, Major?

When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?

Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.

This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.

And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.

I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwängler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.

You live here, in Berlin?

Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?

Says here because of your father. What's that mean?

Steve.

Think you can get me any of that?

Of course.

But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.

What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.

Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?

What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.

That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?

You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?

Who?

If it's too hot, open your tie.

Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.

I have illegitimate children.

Do you know what that is?

Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!

Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?

What?

Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?

And ask him about his private life.

You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.

Was looking at Furtwängler like that?

So, you never heard of him.

Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?

Dr. Furtwängler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.

Mission control to Chuck, come in...

Anything else?

Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?

Great.

Not lately.  Did you check messages?

I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.

Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?

There's so much...

Reese...you got a first name?

I caught one, back there.

This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.

That's where we're going.

Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.

Kyle?

Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?

Sarah.

What are you doing?

I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?

You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.

I didn't build the fucking thing.

Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?

Here's her driver's license.

Send a unit.

Call her.

Same shit.

Go!  Go!  He's got her.

I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.

Did you play recently?

I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...

Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...

I'm so sorry.

Excuse me, I need to explain...

Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...

It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.

The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...

This is C.R.S.

That one did.

We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.

The maitre d' called you Christine.

Where'd you get this?

Do you mind if I sit?

You can talk while I drive us to the police.

Who are "they?"

They did the same to him as they did to you.

I don't know.  A lot.

Who is it?

What are you <u>doing</u> here?

He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...

Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...

No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me...

There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.

Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.

Like what... my favorite color... ?

One brother, one sister.

No.

Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.

About me?

Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.

Call that number.

It's a profound life experience.

It doesn't matter...

Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?

You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!

Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...

Where's Christine?  The waitress.

No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?

How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.

I need your car, Elizabeth.

I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.

We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.

Happy Birthday, Nicholas.

Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.

It's different every time.

Sorry to keep you waiting.

It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.

I need the police.

Didn't I give you two?

Thank you.

Mr. Van Orton... ?

What makes you ask?

What's this about?

He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...

Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...

I wasn't expecting you.

Attractive...

Nicholas...

Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.

Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...

You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?

Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...

Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?

Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.

Because... well, I know I can trust you.

I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.

You're not telling us something.

He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.

Hey!  I heard screaming...

Well, this lot is full!

I didn't do it.

So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?

Yeah.

Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.  Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.

Are you working with her?

All the carvings.

Sorry.

Nell!  What's wrong?

So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.

What happened after you smelled it?

It was a stupid thing to do.

I don't know.

I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.

But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!

Come on.

This is where we're going?

Get a blanket!

Is she asleep?

Me?  No.  What are you doing here?

Is there something about the house?

I love this house.  I really love this house.

Good night, Theo.

Watts?

Is it over?

Theo... Did you?

Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.

I've never had a pedicure before.

I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.

Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> --  -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --

What'd you come back for, babe?

Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?

Am I a thing?

It's not a compliment.

That's what Gordon's always saying.

Italian?

Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.

I like the colors.

No.

How they goin', kid?

Same as last time -- the rest after.

I thought he was in prison, in England.

As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.

You think I'm staying?

Man knows what he likes.

That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.

Edward Rama?

Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.

Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.

I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.

Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom.

What are we standing on?

Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?

Do you have any friends, man?

I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.

Didn't get it.

Perhaps it was the smoke.

Why did you come here?

And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?

Here, aren't you gonna let me in.

Here, are you always this sarky?

She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.

Modelling.

I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.

Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?

-- Your employer?

What line is he in.

So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.

You fuckin' guys and your dicks.

-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.

Won't he be looking for you about now?

Minor officials bother you, don't they?

Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.

She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.

Where's Big Sur?

Fancy it?

Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.

That's where Valentine's scarpered.

Friends and <u>colleagues</u>.

Yeah, I guess you are.

That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.

So what's your beef, pal?

A <u>statement</u>?  I wouldn't mind getting a statement.  You see, <u>my</u> client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.

I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.

Been away a lot.

Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.

How much.

Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.

Like what.

You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.

You know her?

What kind of trouble are you in?

Is he here?

You must know Ian.

Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.

Thanks.  You, too.

Yes?

...Yes?

Ann--

Hello, Rachel.

That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.

...I stank, didn't I?

...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.

I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.

I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music?

Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.

Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.

It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.

...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...

No problem!

...You bring a check?

...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--

All right.

...That's quite a wife you got there.

She's a rare one.

Uh-huh.

Please, Ed.

...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell.

What kind of man *are* you?

...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?

Where you going?

...What's so damn strange about that?

I don't know what's going on. I--

I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.

I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.

Should I... should I tell you why?

Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?

How did you get into the store?

...I don't get it.

Not guilty, your honor...

Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.

I'm fine.

That was something. I'm Ed Crane.

Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?

This hair.

...How you today, Ed?

Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!

I don't understand.

'Lo, Ed.

Hello!

Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!

Yes, sir.

Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...

...Yeah, it's a tough break.

Are you awake?... Is he awake?

What'd he say? Does he understand?

Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.

If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.

Battery's dead.  Shit.

Fifteen... what's next?

I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --

D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.

Who are you?  The undertaker?

Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?

In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.

Lieutenant --

Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.

Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?

I think I should come with you.

Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!

What happened?!

It's still back there!

How much ammo do we have to make a stand?

I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.

We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.

What are we talking about here?

Curious.  There's something missing.

Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --

All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."

With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.

Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.

Where is that?

Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.

This room sucks.

And it snuffled the ground like a dog.

Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.

They've got something.

Oh... my... God!

Jesus, what is this?

Oh no.  I smell it.

What?

That's impossible.

Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?

How does it work?

Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.

No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.

My God.  Then it was an animal.

I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.

It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.

Genetic damage?

I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.

Is there another way around?

What is it doing?

Then it won't go after the others?

For what?

That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!

Help someone!

Just like John.  He won't listen.

I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?

Where exactly?

You want to book the flight?

Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?

I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?

Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.

Are we talking Emmies?

We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.

Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--

Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?

You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?

Sure she would.

You take Japanese.

Lauren, right?

It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.

No...I, er.

Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.

It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?

I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.

I think it's got something to do with my dad.

It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.

Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?

Well, what do you think?

Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.

How did it go today?

I was hoping we could have a special evening.

What're you doing down here?

What did you want?

What do I do?

Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!

Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.

Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--

No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!

You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's?

--Darling--

See you tomorrow, Truman.

I think you better tell us.

Poopy day?

I think that about does it, Spooky.

Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --

You've been back to Dallas?

And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --

Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?

You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?

Have you examined them?

The Federal Building was too well guarded.

You know my work?

And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?

I'll know soon enough.

And they tell me I'm paranoid.

You told me you had answers.

You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.

Mulder -- it's me --

I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.

Had you.

Scully...

Where are you, Mulder?

Scully?

Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.

They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.

Why?

This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.

You're... quitting?

What are you implying, Scully?

You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.

This looks like new grass to you?

Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?

Where would they be going?

You think they went left?

Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?

This virus -- it... 

Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.

Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.

What? What happened?

We've got to keep moving.

Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.

You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.

I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.

Let me out. Stop the car.

We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.

My god...

Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.

You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.

He hates me.

She adores you.

We've been over this a dozen times.  No.

He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.

Like a New Year's Day hangover.

...a pocketful of rye.

What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would you go?

I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...

You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.

COME ON!

Thank you.

You liked him?

What now?

She the one from Santa Cruz?

Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?

Intravenous administration complete.

She changed the codes.

Instead of going into his mind...

When did he lapse into the coma?

Agent Novak.

What about the cat?

The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.

How is she?

After three years she remembers what the guy drove?

Oh, American, thank you. I like them.

No.

Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.

I don't know. They didn't answer.

You shouldn't get mixed up in this.

Drink?

Can I hear you?

Holly.

What happened to your hand?

Have you seen Calloway?

He liked to laugh.

...and my lover. He was Harry.

...is there?

Here, it will be cold on that train.

Nichts danke. Kein.

That's the reason.

They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.

He works in a military hospital.

I said another man was buried in his place.

That's what we want to find out.

...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.

Miss Schmidt.

Get the next plane.

Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.

Well?

So would I.

...be responsible for you in the streets.

...in the morning.

Fifty yards right down there.

I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.

Calloway!

Win what?

Be sensible, Martins.

...of Santa Fe."

Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.

You do!

Seems exciting.

Hello, Harry.

What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?

I'm only safe in the Russian Zone... I'm safe as long as they can use me...

Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?

It's wonderful how you keep the tension.

You really liked it?

We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.

...were of you.

Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?

...you.

Not yet.

Mr. Popescu is here tonight.

...give evidence.

Something wrong.

Mr. Martins...

...this time.

Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.

Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.

Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.

You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.

Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.

Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?

Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.

I don't know - I'm American.

Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.

She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.

We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.

One kilometer

Have you told someone?

Exactly.

That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.

Fucking Danny, man...

Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.

Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?

You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.

Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.

I'm coming to your room tonight.

But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?

I want to learn to read it.

Where are they?

The sex is better.

Fuck that.

No, I think you shouldn't.

Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?

Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny Balint...? We met at that...[meeting at your house.]

Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?

Who's Eichmann?

Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.

...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...

Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.

That would be a catastrophic mistake.

Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.

They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?

The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?

And? WHat did you notice?

Jewish girls like to give head, right?

Because the Jew is essentially female.

Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.

Who? How would I know him?

Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?

Which <i>Times</i> guy?

So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?

All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....

And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.

Do you feel you're making progress here?

But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.

Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...

Hello...?

Get out of here....

What is it?

Shut up. Fuck you....

Oh, what is this shit?

The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.

Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.

Who'd you kill?

Leary?

We tested the new bomb.

You're going to live here permanently?

He's shy, not like Enzo.

I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?

You're right.  You're fired.

I tell you she's mine!

I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?

A new world record!  That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow!  You ever been to Tahiti?

Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?

Well, good night, then...

... It's a comfortable place.

Jacques!  Johana!

What else is there?

You risk your life when you cross the street.

Because you'd laugh.

Why?

Roberto?  How long?

The medics are looking all over for you.

Where did you get that?

Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!

What's with the voice?

You're the best, Enzo!

... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?

It's okay.

Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.

Why?  Are they what's most important?

No, I have to ask you a favor...  You're the only one who'll understand.

Good night.

You don't have that one, do you?

... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!

I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.

Anybody can have a bad day!

No!  I would never cheat you.

... Push me back in the water...

Tea... or whiskey?

You jumped in?

... No?

Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?

Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.

So have I.  ... Hello?

And you?

Jacques...?

Jacques?  I'm pregnant.

Promise me one thing.

Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?

Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?

Uncle Louis!

Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?

Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?

How was your trip?

Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.

It was a trap. I'm back at square one.

Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.

Looks like I got a plane to catch.

Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.

Client notes. Sorry.  What can I do for you?

What was that!?

What!?

Mordechai?

Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.

I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.

Esther!

Happy Hanukkah Tikva.

You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...

What are you doing?

How do we bypass it?

I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?

So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?

Bootleg copies of the Frank Capra classic, 'It's A Wonderful Life.'

Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.

What day is it?

My soninlaw. What do you think of him?

Mmmyes.

Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met

North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head - maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone 

It's a blackcard and bad card, but not the card of the cat - not the card of fourfooted things.

Cut.

The death card - -

He will be waiting...

Pedro is waiting for me, too.

Show business?

You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?

It doesn't jibe with this  you told me the leopard would go out into the country - it wouldn't stay in the city 

That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.

Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.

Yes, but what sort of a man?

To the eye? Like other men.

Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?

So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.

I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -

You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.

Yes. The lipstick.

Makes no difference. Get him out!

On his back, I suppose.

That's easy. Me.

This is l939. Can't you subtract?

No  not yet.

Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.

Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --

Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.

You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --

We stood here once before.

I hated you that day - you and your flip talk - with that little girl lying dead.

Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Whys that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess theres space enough for war games... Must be good for business.

Good afternoon. De Moraess residence.

By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistresss brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?

Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brothers death.

What about you, Mrs De Moraes?

Its a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. Im told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you dont require a definition.

You seem surprised. Could it be you dont think that badly of him after all?  You neednt worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.

I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.

How dare you...  You dont know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?

Im impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.

Are we understood?

Huh! Really? Hotels?

You know hed have had him killed, dont you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?

How... When did you...

Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?

What do you mean, No, Mrs De Moraes?

Leons not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leons found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned Id exceeded his expectations.

Kids are not your thing, Deborah. Youd have been ready for me when I turned up with Sleeping Beauty. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. Not Leon, you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didnt say My God!, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. Not Leon. Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman Id stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didnt you?

One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?

A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?

What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?

Where is that?

To get me killed...?

The staff dont know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldnt take any more...

Im sorry, sir. Could you try that again?

Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?

By your Austrian?

Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...

Look, you dont tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Whos the guy? The Austrian?

What...?

Im finished here and Im tired, Emily. You shouldnt be here. Now dont make it worse.

Im calling about the puppies.

I saw the ad at Georges.  Im passing through town and Im in a hurry.

Why?

Who are you?

Whats this place? A hotel of some kind?

Where are the kids?

How many of you scumbags are here?

What about the staff?  Theyre in on whats going on, arent they?  How many of them?

Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?

I came to feed your fish. I didnt know...

Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say youre my secretary, all right?

Hello, Jane. Its me.

Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?

You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.

How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?

Check with your sons bank. Banks dont usually give out information about their customers.

I presume you checked your sons apartment...

I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?

£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?

Lets go.

Trying to say something, Martin?

The Hyatt...? Whats that?

At what time will you be available?

What are you talking about?

Five to three. Youre early.

Your lady friend did.

And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian?

Leon? No. Im afraid he left.

In my jacket. Left inside pocket.

...Leons not here. How did you get here? Phil doesnt know where I live.

You thought wrong. I havent seen Leon for months.

He just said he had good reasons.

Theyre German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. Its not guilt, more of a curse...  And then theres something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think thats just one of Leons dark delusions...

The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?

He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...

Huh... I guess you aint quite ready for civilisation yet... Ill give you one more day, a meal, and then youre on your way.

Los Angeles is 100 miles away.

No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.

What about which girlfriend?

Mon bureau coûtait trop cher.

Le montage, lemballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors stuff. How much would it cost me?

So why didnt he?

So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?

Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.

What sums?

My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!

Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.

Jean, it's... it's not so easy...

What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?

I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.

I also need someone who can read and write.

I thought you were an archer?

Jeanne, stop it!

He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!

Good.

The king said you're his finest archer...?

They've abandoned me... like everyone.

All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.

I don't know it.  I feel it.

The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.

Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?

I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.

To be killed in battle?

Go onto the next question.

And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?

Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?

And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?

Yes, but...

Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...

But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...

Dead you're worthless, darling.

My king will pay any ransom you ask.

Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!

Who are you?

You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.

Please... may I have it back...

I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!

Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...

It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...

... and what... what did he say?

Get them out of here!

Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?

I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?

Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?

May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?

Good.  Where are the English?

Wait, wait...

Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.

"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!

Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...

Well...?  Shall we go?

God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.

And... what does Jeanne think?

Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?

Jeanne... The men are exhausted!

Do you know how to count?

So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?

But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!

So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??

We... won?!

You don't believe me anymore?

As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?

What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?

Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?

Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!

I... I never lied!

Why were you yelling like that?!

Yes... that's what I pray for...!

They won't come anyway.

God asked you to do something?

No.  That was a sword in a field.

No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!

I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...

Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.

You know I'm always happy to see you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...

They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.

He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.

Then... why are you here so often?

Beautiful.

He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?

I want to be with him always...

Someone you know?

I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.

Sit.

I need help.

For what? For my tie?

Get your things together, you have to leave!

Believe me, they've picked him up.

Can you help?

Can you help us?

Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?

It's not funny.

Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?

What's the matter? Are you sick?

Very appropriate.

No one thought they'd hold out so long.

Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.

They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.

Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.

I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.

You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.

What's your work?

What's all that gunfire?

Are the Russians here?

Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave.

We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.

No, it was a table.

Which mountains are those dear?

Yes, why not.

Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.

No, words. You have never heard words?

You have to wash them.

Everyone has to practice.

Oh no, it can't come now.

I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.

What are ya gonna do, call the cops?

Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.

7 to 2.  That ain't bad.

Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!

Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.

If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.

These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.

Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.

No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.

And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.

Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.

You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?

There's always a depression on.

What the hell you gonna do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan?  You're committin' suicide, kid.

I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.

Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.

Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.

Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.

You just worry about your end, kid.

Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?

You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.

I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.

I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.

The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.

We'll use the wire.  Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.

Raise 1,000.

See and raise 1,000.

How do I know you're tellin' the truth.

Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?

My end was only one.

What time you get off work here?

You doin' anything tonight?

Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?

All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.

What does this guy want?

Looks like he missed ya.

Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.

Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.

He'll have to take a check.  I couldn't find my wallet.

What do you mean?

Get on with it then.

You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.

And you were gonna pay me back?

You stayin' in or not?

You got the 400 grand yet?

No.

What happened?

We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.

You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?

Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.

What is this?  I got work to do.

Do ya know him or don't ya?

Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.

Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?

How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?

Don't.  It's horrible.

You took that money from Julia's hand.

Then what are you hiding?

All right, then.  I'll tell them.

Aren't you Nick Charles?

I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.

Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.

Where did you get this gun?

Dead?

It's been the same one for three months.

He'll still be your son-in-law!

I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.

Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?

Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.

Nothing.

You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.

What about the suicide?

For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.

What about Jorgensen?

I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.

Just rolled them up and threw them in.

Could this be him?

He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.

Shut up.

I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....

I didn't know they had a fight.

You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?

Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?

That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.

Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!

I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.

and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.

We're just having a little drink.

I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.

I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.

I can't! I haven't got it!

I never had it.

Oh, he's sitting up.

Did you get my money?

Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?

Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....

You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.

But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.

Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.

Dorothy!  Is she here?

But he has nothing to do with it!

This is all very pleasant but why are here?

You did... where?

Oh, did he?  What did he say?

Perfectly absurd.

It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.

That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.

How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.

What am I?  The fall guy?

I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --

Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.

I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?

Isn't that my drink?

No thanks.

Everybody says you were a grand detective.

She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?

It's all right.  It just grazed me.

I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?

On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!

Aren't you hot in that?

Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".

Sit down!

So am I.

I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?

What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?

What are you going to do?

Nick - I won't have you going down there.

I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.

Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.

You bet I wouldn't.

You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.

How long has he been dead?

I'm going to tell her.

But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...

You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.

Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.

You worked here?

You his wife?

I just wanted to tell you...

Who fired you?

You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?

Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?

...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.

What are we going to do!?

They shouldn't have been here.

What are you doing.

Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.

We've got rope?

All we've got to do is make it to the top.

Not much of a pass.

We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.

You're the one with all the ideas.

Stop it!

Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.

I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.

You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.

Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.

Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.

You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.

Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.

This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?

And you know what that area is?  It's Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe you've read about it.

But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.

They're not going to--

What?

And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?

SAY IT!

Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.

I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.

What!?

What?

You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!

I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.

My leg is falling asleep.

You're going to be fine.

You don't know that.  It could be a trick.

This.  Whatever it is.

But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.

Where is it?  Where'd it go?

What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?

What are you doing?

It looks like you're not doing anything.

Get up and dig.

It's just a mongoose.

Wait.

Wes might be right about that.

We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.

I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.

Epps?

I don't want to die.

Sorry.

We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.

I pick that way.

You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.

Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.

And then shoot them.

Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!

...Wes...?

Can you ride a horse?

We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.

I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.

Some good ones.

Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.

He says it's a box.

It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.

You will.  You'll get it.

You really think there's a treasure inside?

Jaeger?

They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--

That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.

This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.

Iraqis.

We have to go back.

You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.

I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.

So?

Maybe we should give him some water.

Think the Iraqi's killed them all?

I can't hear him.

Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.

HUMMMM.....

Control ON.

What's this?  Why did you change it?

When?

I've never been under the table before.

Look, food!

What are you doing?

Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.

Good Lord!

There goes another of your disciples.

He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.

Wait!  I'll talk to him.

I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.

What's going on?

Where's LUH?

How do you know?

Maternity ward, huhh!

Oh, That!  I'm 5555 SRT Entron..

I knew him.

That's not it.

...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...

Dispatch, this is Reilly.

Where did you get this?

Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.

What're you talking about?

I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?

Only once, at Redstone.

An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.

Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?

Driving in circles, waiting for-

No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...

Fuck factor?

Wires... metal, cold... something soft...

More metal... sharp edge...

Something round, two wires ...

Yeah, another round thing.

What... ?

How the hell do you feel yellow?

Political.

Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.

We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.

C4, plastic explosive.

Computer device?

Alright!

Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.

What about the ballistics report?

I'm filing charges against that mother-

Next week we work the park.

What was it this time?

Vice cop on a homicide?

Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.

Sir...

It's our only option.

What?  I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye!  Yes?

Yes.

Eleven o'clock! 

The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.

The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.

No.

Yes!

But--

No color, no sparkle--but dependable.

And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.

I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--

It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--

Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!

You say I am a crook.

Monescu.

The tennis player?

Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?

Thank you!

Please.

The pepper, too?

I like you, Baron.

Monescu!

The fourteenth of May.

Two fifty-three, five--

Five, seven, and nine--

Correct. Now the train leaves--

<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.

Now, Lily--

You <u>have</u> to get out of here!

And you--

Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company! 

You know the main staircase in the opera?

Neither do I.  That's where I found it.

Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.

Naturally I did.

You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.

But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.

Oh? 

No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.

Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--

Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--

And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.

The same thing.

Precisely.

Like that!

Instantly.

Adolph J. Giron.

Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.

Lovely.

Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.

Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...

You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.

Yes, madame?

About what?

Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?

Right!

Yes, madame?

I beg your pardon!

You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.

Yes, I saw it--but--

How much time?

Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!

Bottom, left, right. I have it.

Shit.

So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!

Holy shit.

Rush her.

What?

I make my own luck.

I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.

Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?

Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.

But I was with him the whole time.

Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.

This should be amusing.

'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!

The boats are all going.

Cor... look at that, would ya.

Oy, mate... that was a close shave.

The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.

They'll pull us right down I tell ya!

So you've not lit the last four boilers then?

No you won't.

Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --

Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.

Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?

Oh God, I am such an utter fool.

So don't marry him.

Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.

A whole ten cents?!

Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.

You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?

May I cut in, miss?

You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.

Fabrizio said you might be up --

Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.

What is it? A sapphire?

Where to, Miss?

When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.

Yes sir.

Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.

Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?

Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.

Anya!

Anya, I think you're crazy.

Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?

Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?

Good afternoon--

Will you pardon me?

No-o!

What did you want a gun for?

I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 

How about a little game later?

And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.

I thought you were one of my friends.

You've got lipstick all over you.

--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.

This is Mr.--er--

Isn't she attractive?

This time I'm really glad you showed up.

What, again?

I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.

I could see you were pining away--

Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--

I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.

Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.

A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!

Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.

Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.

Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?

Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.

Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.

You keep it-- 

Hello, Jimmy. What's up?

On the drunk.

Come in! 

I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.

Three Jacks.

How's your mother feeling?

Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.

That goes two ways.

You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.

I'll go with you.

Hello, young fellow!

Don't get yourself all worked up--

Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?

Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?

Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.

Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?

Now we get it down to two words--"next month."

That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.

Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!

I'll say--how fast is this boat going?

Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--

Yes--Me--in person!

Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.

Come on, get up.  That horse is carrying too much of a load.

Oh, there you are--

You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.

I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?

And you've put it over--haven't you?

Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?

You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.

It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.

Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--

Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.

Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?

Why--don't you like him?

Well, let's hear the poem--

Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!

With your dry wit and humor--

H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!

Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--

Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 

Yes, Yes!

No!

I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--

He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?

And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?

I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.

Oh, for Christ's sake!

Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.

Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'.

What d'you think of the singer?

Shut up, Ike.

I want them spitting blood!

Come on, you...

Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.

Age quod agis.

That's just my game.

I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?

You don't even know him.

That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.

We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.

Doc!  How the hell are you?

So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.

I don't know.  Probably ignore her.

Maybe I ought to go out there.

Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair.

I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much

I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I Literally don't care if I live or Die.  But even I can't fight human Instinct.  Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?

I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.

A which?

Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.

You really look awful.

Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.

No.

You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.

But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.

Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before?

Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.  You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.

We've never actually met.  My Name's-

Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?

Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.

What's wrong?

Come up to the fire, honey.

Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?

Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be?

All right, look.  I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie.  I can, I swear.

Run for your lives, boys!  It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas!

Boy, look at all those stars.  Bet You can see every star there is. Practical touch 'em.  Kinda makes You think, you know?  I mean you Look up and you think God made All that but he still remembered To make a little speck like me. Kinda flattering really.  Hey, Wyatt, you believe in God?  No, Come on, really, do you?

Well what do you think happens When you die?

It's that woman from the coach!

Hey Doc!  Come on now.

All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.

Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?

Look at that.  Busted.  Brand new Money Ward, too.  33 years old And I don't even have a decent Watch.  'Bout time I started Lookin' out for myself.

Look pretty rough.

Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.

You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money.  Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings.  Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.

It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-

Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.

Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.

It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark.

Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.

By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?

Briefly.

...And what's that, my dear?

I'm sure they will.

In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.

Tsi tien, Chien-penny.

Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.

What - no lust for adventure?

What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?

Do you feel better now?

Just - say it. Say it just once.

His newspapers?

Gone fishing.

It was an authorized test. I returned the money.

Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.

A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?

I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?

I got you covered.

Sidney Winch, meet -

Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.

Nice to run into you again.

I hope you'll be gentle.

Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.

Wait here.

Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.

Here. You shoot. I'll drive.

Sleep well?

But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.

...I'll give you a ring from Venice.

Sakwa!

Who's in charge here?

I was an attorney!

The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -

Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations

And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.

A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!

How sweet.

Bore through.  ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond.  They're wrong.  Revenge is the best revenge.

They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!

Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.

Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.

I pay my own way.

Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.

When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?

This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.

I'll drive her to the hospital.

You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.

I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.

We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.

Why does he always pick on me?

Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?

I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted.

It was nip and tuck.

Harry is coming to pick me up.

What is that?

Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?

I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.

He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.

I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.

You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.

I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.

This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.

Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.

It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window

What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.

One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.

I have someone I want you to meet.

Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.

You invited me.

Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.

I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.

You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.

Some folks take that natural stuff too far.

You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.

We can't really bring another family in here with us.

I'm sorry he got those birds.

I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.

But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.

Can we leave this up 'til we move?

To infinity and beyond!

Andy!  I'm heading out the door.

I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.

Here!  In the car!

Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?

What are you doing over there?

We're almost there.

Well, let's see, we've got double A's --

Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.

They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.

Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.

And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.

What's going on?

Oh.  Oh, that's good.

Sheriff, this is no time to panic.

No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.

Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!

Spaceship.

Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.

Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.

Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.

Well, thanks for the ride.

Great!

Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!

No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!

Oh, no!

Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?

I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.

Laser-envy.

Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!

Okay, we're on the last present now...

Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.

This is ludicrous.

This town ain't big enough for the two of us!

Hey, Slinky?

Bad news?!

Woody, what are you doing under the bed?

Woody?!

Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.

Woody!  Speed up!

You'll put your clothes here.

I like plaits.

Curled up on the landing like love locked out!

Who's there?

Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.

He'll murder you when he finds out.

Stop it!

I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.

I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.

I'm Melanie.

Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.

He's not here.

What is he planning on telling them?

How much do I pay him?

Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.

Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.

Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.

Helena, please.  This is out of your hands.

It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?

Don't bother.

You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.

Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.

This is different.

Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.

You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.

God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?

He didn't hang around us.  He's like one of those hippie kids.  I'm not part of that group.  It was a party in all these rooms.  His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do?  I mean, what would you have done if you had been us?

You all right?

We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --

Okay, young lady, that's it.

Live with your parents?

In school?

Private?

How are your grades?

What are you doing?

I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.

Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?

Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.

All the professionals keep them in the trunk.

Women's room, stall two.  Should we stop for ice-cream?

I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.

You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.

I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.

You first.

Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.

Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come?

Madrigal's alive.

I'm curious how you did this with such economy.

The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso?

That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?

Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?

I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.

Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.

Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.

He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --

I'll be right after you.

I want the money, Mark, that's all.

No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --

Shut you mouth or you'll be next.

Twenty thousand.

It's a scandal, Franco.

Buy yourself that island in the sun?

We'll be half-way down the road with the money.

Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.

Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?

Christ, I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.

Holding hands?

In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.

Yes.

You're too young.

So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.

Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.

What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?

I'm an old boy myself, you know?

Strive, hope, believe and conquer.

No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.

Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.

I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.

No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.

But try too hard --

Exactly.

You Only Live Twice?

Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.

No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.

Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.

Cut it out.

I can't believe you did that.

How much?

But you don't have the money?

And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?

This had better be good.

Six weeks!

Qual se tu?

It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.

Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.

In firing position. Torpedo armed.

What's Emergency Landing Plan B?

This is the Starship Enterprise.

Can we have it quiet?

Your pain runs deep.

I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?

What is it you seek?

But how?

Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?

Ah, Captain?

What are you doing?

Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.

Damnit, Spock. God damnit!

There, you see? See?

I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.

Is it possible?

Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.

I am here, Captain.

There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.

What is this?

Spock?

I trust your message was received?

What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?

No special conditions?







Borgus Frat.

And I thought we were supposed to be going together.

No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.

I am a Starfleet Officer.

Why not?

Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!

You did break in.

Dillinger?

Want one?

I want to go to his place.

Of what?

I don't think I'm cleared for this.

Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.

Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.

They'll start to soon enough.

That all you can say?

This honey doesn't handle so good in town...

You said it.

Meanwhile, he might find it.

Cute.

The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.

You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?

Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...

Who is your User, program?

Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?

How about over there...that empty memory?

We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master

Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?

Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.

Flynn... you can't... I

You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.

Yeah, yeah -- that's great.

Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...

It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...

Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...

Thank. you, Master Control.

Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?

You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?

Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.

The Users...you really think they're still there?

Do you know what he's talking about?

My quarters.

Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why weren't you in class today?

You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?

They call him "The Sand Spider".				*

Probably because it sounds scary.				*

Harry?  HARRY?!

What's this for?

Thanks dear.

Fourteen, Harry.

You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.

What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.

Station wagon?

What's the plan?

Nobody believes it can happen to them.

Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?

Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.

Guy's a spook!

It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?

Now what?

I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.

Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?

So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?

Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.

Do you like my tomb?  The museum				* financing fell out, so I thought				* your clients might be interested.

Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.

Did you tell her about us, Harry?

Uh huh.  Okay.

I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.

Look, I know you're upset.  I'm really sorry, honey.  I raced home as quick--

...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.

Uh huh.

They said you had to run out.

And you agreed?

I don't know.  I guess I needed something...

Let me out of her!  Right now!

Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--

So last night was pretty exciting, huh?

Now slide the nylons off one by one.

I'm sorry, honey.

Is it working yet?

As much as you used to?

What are you going to do?

Oh shit.

What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?

Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet.  But it's not enough.  If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.

Sorry.  Trade secret.

Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?

See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?

Yeeaoowww!!

Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?

What?

Hello?

Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.

Worse than Cairo?							*

What's happened?

To our assignment.

You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.

Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?

You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?

I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.

Tell him we gotta go.

Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.

Bye-bye.

... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.

I love to get pie after a movie.

Tell me about yourself.

Ask me them again. One by one.

Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.

Burt Reynolds.

What are your turn-ons?

How long have you worked here?

What's that?

Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.

She OD'd, didn't she?

You're a whore?

That dazzling imagination.

You have a pimp?

A real live pimp?

Is he nice?

Yes.

Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?

I do.

Is this a joke?

I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.

I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.

I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?

What the fuck are you talkin' about?

I'm hip.

Yeah.

I can't believe what you're tellin' me.

You'd really do that?

If I thought I could get away with it -

All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.

Clarence sent a letter?

That's a pretty amazing story.

... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.

How much of that letter was on the up and up?

Clarence.

In case of what?

No. But thanks.

When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.

I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.

What?

He wants to talk ya.

But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.

Oh, Mr. Donowitz -

You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.

If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?

Yes, I still have friends on the force.

What makes you think I could do that?

I don't know. He just appeared as magic.

That was a good fuckin' movie.

Or a bit player -

You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -

Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -

Nicholson and I.

He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.

Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.

Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.

Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!

Just put it in your purse.

Yes.

Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?

The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become "addicted" have you, Cole?  To that "dying" world'

To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.

What kind of information?

You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?

Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.

I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?

"Never cry wolf!"

About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.

A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.

Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!

I told you what I want.  Lock the door!

The guy was a total fruitcake.

We need gas.

I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.

You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?

What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?

I need help all right.  They're coming after me.

Just like that?  You were in prison?

You want me to rob him?

It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...

You... you couldn't have heard me.

I know this place! ... This is my dream.

What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.

Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.

They hurt you!

What....???

Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!

JOSE!

What...virus?

What?  What did you say?

Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.

Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?

I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.

He no!

Nothing.

Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.

It's nonsense.

Can I help you, sir?

Where in Mexico would you like--

You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--

It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.

Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?

Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back.  You don't look so good.

Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.

You think bad, and bad is what you get.

Please, just leave the car alone.

What would a truck stop be without beer?

No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.

That yours, Mrs. McKenna?

Is that the way you want it, boy?  A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert?  Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.

How could I?  I was sleeping.

Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.

Can I give you a hand, beautiful?

Wasn't nothing.

Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.

Where you coming from?

Where you headed?

I didn't say it bothered me.

Nice place you got here.

What do you do anyway?

Beautiful?

No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?

That's not an answer.  What is it you want?

Doesn't the heat bother you?

I'm guessing no.

All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.

I don't know how.

How far is it to California?

He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.

There is no us, remember?

Why the hell didn't you do anything?

If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?

Let's go in the bedroom.

He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.

You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?

The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.

It's . . . it's locked.

I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.

Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.

For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!

I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.

What brings you to Sierra?

I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.

Why would I kill her?

Good Lord.  What happened to you?

You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.

Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.

You meant it.

Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.

And for that you'd kill Grace?

Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.

I guess I might as well get this done with.

You know what I mean.

You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?

Drop it, Jake.

Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?

Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.

Yeah, well, me too.

He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.

It's the truth, Jake.

Got any requests?

Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.

I wasn't doing anything.

Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.

Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.

His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.

Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.

Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.

Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.

Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.

No police!  Wait until I'm gone.

Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.

Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.

Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.

You sure seen a lot for a blind man.

I think I've heard that before.

I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?

Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.

Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.

Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.

Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.

Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?

Christ, I don't believe this!

Mister!

Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.

Say, what happened to your hand?

I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.

Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.

I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--

Talk?  About what?

Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.

You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.

Shhh! Liar.

What happened to your hand?

Got any requests?

You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.

You Harlin?

You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--

Great!

How much time?

A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?

I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.

Then you ain't gonna have the car.

It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.

Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.

Look, Harlin.

Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.

Soda.  You got any soda?

I don't know your real name.

You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?

What do you do anyway?

Where'd you learn to do that?

Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.

I think I can find my own way back to into town.

You never did answer my question.

Doesn't the isolation bother you?

You love him?

Is that why you're with him?

All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.

It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.

You'd never understand.

I wanted to talk.

Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?

Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?

I don't know about that?

I'm not sailing his boat.

No Grace, my hand's bothering me.

Time to go for a walk, Jake.

Why's that?

...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.

The old lady?

Yeah, if you could send it care of...

What'd you say to me!

How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.

Beck's.

Morning Grace.

Anybody hurt?

You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?

Who was that on the phone?

What the hell you looking at, girl?

You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.

I want to stay.

Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.

Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians?

What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?

Not a specific day. What's this about?

...I can't remember.

When was the last time I wore pink?

Oh shit...

Megan?

I remember you.

...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?

He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.

He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.

I assumed because of the train.

What do you want?

Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.

I thought he was carrying something.

Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.

No Jeremy.

How much is it?

How many did you put on that time?

That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.

I'll just shoot him once.

You represent someone in Philadelphia?

He doesn't look very threatening.

How are you feeling?

Was your family traveling with you?

She's gonna live.  She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke.

You told them cowboys you had it.

I didn't think they'd really do it.

Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.

Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?

He's coming ain't he?

I thought... you was an angel.

Some big guy beat the shit out of me.  I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?

Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.

I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.

What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.

You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.

This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.

She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.

An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?

All week?

That much, huh?

Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.

Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?

That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?

Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.

"Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."

He hanged him?  Shot him down?

He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.

Yeah, I guess so.

Oh.

I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.

Three ways, I figured.

An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.

What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?

He ain't killed.

When we gonna double back?

Yeah, I guess so.

First one I ever killed.

Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.

I trust you, Bill.

I... I... think I'm... shot.

How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?

Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.

He hit you?

He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?

You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?

IS THAT YOU, KID?

Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.

I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin' bed.

I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  I guess we could use some now.

Claudia... ain't here, Bill.

Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.

He say anythin'... The Kid... ?

No... I meant...

Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...

Far enough.

Fuck you.

Say, Ned... ?

How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?

Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.

I don't kill nobody without him. 

Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?

That ain't what I mean.

I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.

I don't get it.

&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;

Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.

&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;

Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.

...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.

I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.

How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.

DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.

You heard right.

He's alright.

Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.

Get out.

How are they going to do it?

Three million?

We'll make it.

The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.

Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.

What do you mean I can't see him?

Weapons. Misdemeanor two.

He won't go into the interrogation room.

You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?

I don't know about that.

You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.

Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.

A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.

Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.

TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .

I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.

His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.

But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.

Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'

I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?

No...

NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

This is all bullshit.

No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.

He was accused of jury tampering.

We thought it was just.

... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...

This is going to drive the ante up.

No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...

Say it.

You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...

Thank you.  When Debby...

...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.

You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?

Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?

You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?

In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?

...sworn before God you would tell the truth?

Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?

I do.  Yes.

If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.

Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...

Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?

Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?

I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'

Dr. Thompson...?

...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...

Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?

'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.'  General textbook on the subject.  Is  that correct?

And you wrote that...

...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?

I appreciate--a man as busy as--

He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?

Who are you protecting, then?

I could subpoena him if I had a week.

Is the Plaintiff ready?

Yes, Mr. Galvin?

Continental Casualty...

Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...

This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?

Pardon?

I'm a lawyer.

Really.  How wonderful for you.

Do you think it's my fault?

You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.

Maybe I'll tell you later.

Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!

What are you going to do?

... hey, I don't need your charity ...

I have to talk to you.

Come on.  Let's get a drink.

You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'

...he's a good man...

...I have to stand up for her...

Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.

Brindisi versus Electric Boat.

Today is Tuesday.  What?

And all we've got is a witch doctor!

I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?

We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?

Yes.  Yes, I have.

He saw her at the Northern Care...

What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...

Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...

What?

And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?

Well, well, well.  Huh?

You have a record of what happened in the operating room...

Yes.

I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.

My name is John Ferguson, and --

You.

Will you have dinner with me?

Then will you for me?

Mmm.

And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?

Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.

There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.

Scottie, what are you doing?

But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.

You want me to dress like her?

Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!

I don't like it!

The color of your hair...

Ernie's?

Come here.

We're going awfully far.

Scottie, why are we here?

But why? Why here?

And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.

We're going up the tower.

Scottie, please...!

And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!

Why am I here? What happened?

I hope we will, too.

No.

Do you hear anything?

And no birds sing.

Where were you born?

No, I can't tell you!

Would you know the room?

A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?

I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!

Go on.

Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?

There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.

Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.

No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --

Ow!!

I had to quit, Midge.

I know. Everybody tells me.

From that music.

An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.

I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.

Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --

Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.

Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?

Is she pretty?

Just wander.

What have you been doing?

It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.

By her own hand.  There are many such stories.

Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment.

The stripper's here.

Jesus.

No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.

Name one.

About anybody but yourself. You never have.

If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.

You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.

Wait!

Are you sure this was an accident?

Stop it!

How do you figure?

We have to get going.

Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.

What is your problem?

What?

I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!

I won't do it.

You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.

I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...

Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?

What is it?

She's not here.

Who?

That's right.

Is everything okay?

Keith Richards, Dean Martin...

Where do you look? What side of the neck?

Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.

She's dead. Call somebody!

All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.

That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.

Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.

He's cracked up.

I just want to get married.

What's your point?

And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?

That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.

That's right.

This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.

Okay fine.

False.

Not true.

I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.

We're goosed! Goosed by God!

Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.

These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?

Why can't we do it through the mail?

Can't we do it on the phone?

Photographer?

I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.

He's my friend. He's not a moron.

I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...

He just doesn't talk a lot.

Time out.

Will you please call the chair people?

Just call and let me know that your okay.

Hi.  Are you calling from jail?

Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?

That's sweet.

Just a bit of organizing.

"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.

Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.

That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.

Call the police.

My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?

Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.

No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.

I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much...

What?

Just kills me...

Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.

I'm not breathing right.

I'm getting married...

I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.

He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.

Well that ought to be about the end of that.

We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.

Good times.

You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.

They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.

Enedina and Paco ...

You have no feelings toward ...

How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.

Never.

This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.

How strange you are! When I asked you to do this favor for me you refused. You seemed almost offended. And now, here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. Thank you, my child!

Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.

What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.

That's fifteen by seven?

Have you thought of what you want planted yet?

Ramona! Ramona!

She's mad.

I don't know, sir.

Miss Viridiana ...

Well... is it so urgent?

I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.

Are your parents alive?

Forgive me if I have offended you.

How do you feel?

) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies...

Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?

What are they doing in Los Feliz?

You were supposed to act as if everything was real.

You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.

When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?

What happens if I can't catch him?

Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...

You know how much man power you're talking about?

This better not be a wild goose chase.

How does he know who I am?

Get that fucking thing away from me!

Coordinated by polymer neural net.

I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.

You catching my drift?

You actually listen to all those tapes?

John died.

If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.

I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.

Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.

Give me your wrist.

Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?

Don't worry about it, all right?

You know I am.

No, this is great.

It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.

Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?

...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.

I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.

Sorry, Mr. Gekko.

The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.

Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.

I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.

And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.

Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.

Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...

Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.

So, how did your conference go with Gordon?

You have modest wants. I like that in a man.

...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...

Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...

Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.

Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!

I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.

You were never that innocent sugarpie.

You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.

Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.

What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.

I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.

You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...

Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.

Yeah 

What's that?

We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?

Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.

Your books Master Loftmore

No Jonathan.

She went to a waxwork party

No Mark. MARK Why not?

Come on.

No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.

You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!

Well?

Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.

I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.

I miss you.

Did you?

Who's idea was it?

Why is he worried?

You're saying you willed these events to happen?

What?

There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.

Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.

Who?

Who are you?

I've seen you.  From the window.

He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...

Tell me.  Please.

Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...

Would you like some iced tea?

You must think I'm pathetic.

What's your name?

What was her major?

You should have heard her play.

How you holding up?

Thanks, but I'm fine.

Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.

In the window.  Norman's at work.

We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?

Oh...

Something was there.  You saw it.

But Claire--

Oh God...you knew.

I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.

She could have hurt me if she wanted to.

Jody he was lying.

She's awake.

Claire?

If you have to work...

You did a great job.  She's a good kid.

And we moved out here for the quiet.

Maybe we should just...

Did she say that?

Why?

I just wish you could have heard her.

Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.

Sorry.  You understand.

Our house.

Where is she then?

See?

Oh.

...like it never even happened...

What are you doing?

There we go.

Are you lonely?

What are you doing out here?

How did you--

Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...

I'm sorry...

What?

You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...

We walked all night...

A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...

It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.

I may have seen her on campus.

...I'm positive this time...

It's Madison Fra--

She did it.

Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.

Do you know it?

I know.

:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?

Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.

Are you alright...?  You look pale.

There are two.

With his hands!

You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!

I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.

on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.

I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?

I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.

You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.

E11ie - Diedre died at five o'clock this morning.    Obviously, there are 1egal matters.  Your discretion will be -

I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -

Who the hel1 -

When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!

You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.

She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!

I don't want the -

Lasher - bring us through!

- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -

Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...

I know that you're evil.

--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.

Only you...

I do not understand...

Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?

The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!

Harder...

Yessss...

I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.

You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -

My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.

Stop it.

Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -

Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.

C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---

Everyone - this is Michael curry.

I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.

I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.

Wanna snack...?

Hey - you're bleeding.

ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.

Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.

When aid you get home last night...?

You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.

A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.

Rowan Mayfair.

I thought it was 'whistle while you work.

I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?

OH MY GAWD!

Sounds good - thank you

Do you take sugar?

If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen

Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?

What did you do with her?

The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?

Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?

then why did you marry her -

My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted

I want it to stop - it all to stop...

What?

First finish your tea...

whats wrong...what have I done wrong?

I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...

It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?

I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.

I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...

Dr STECKLER?

Sugar?

See? Did you see that?

Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.

Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.

What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?

Who the hell was your father?

Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.

I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.

Check this out.  Hurry!

Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?

I get it now. You and me. We're dead.

Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.

Oh, how inappropriate is that!

Get them together.

You got everything you ever wanted.

Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called "Heaven."

What gives, Don Corleone?

New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.

That explains the emptiness that haunts me.

Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?

Great jacket, Teddy Bear.

I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.

We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.

You're way ahead of me again?

Son.

Finally, some gratitude.

The one with the horses.

Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?

Who exactly ARE you?

Ted! Do something!

But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.

But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.

They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.

Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."

They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.

That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.

Are they okay?

So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.

Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?

A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.

Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.

Me?

My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.

You're amazing.

Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.

A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.

That has more to do with your proximity to me.

I see.

A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."

I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."

You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.

And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."

What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?

Well? Surprised?

Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?

You promise you'll finish school?

Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?

I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.

That's a good start, yes. A very good start.

Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.

You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.

I'm warning you.

You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.

You do like girls, don't you?

The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.

Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?

You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.

No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.

The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.

At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.

I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.

In a hurry, are we?

Are you familiar with "Heaven?"

All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...

No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.

You mean he withdrew...

And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?

Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?

Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?

Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.

You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.

That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.

I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...

They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.

This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?

Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.

Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...

He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.

You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.

No.

Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.

You guess?  Did he or didn't he?

This wasn't my idea.

You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...

My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.

Kelly.  What is it?

Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...

Don't forget the car wash.

Look, he forgot.  I knew it.

All right.  I'll have to look for it.

Kelly...

God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.

I'm running away.

But check this...

Forget it.

You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.

I just want my life back...

You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.

Who is it?

Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.

Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...

Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.

Yes.

But she ran away.

You mean this thing?

I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?

I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.

That was about as grim as it gets.

Why don't you come in, have a drink?

Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.

Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.

Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...

Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.

Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.

That's a lot of butler.

All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...

Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.

So... what happened?

They're so precious when they're asleep.

This is good.

So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?

When we find him, he is mine.

We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.

Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...

I could get used to this, looking down on people.

My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.

We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!

Where'd he say he was going to do this?

These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.

This is something.

Now it's a bomb.

Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...

Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?

You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.

You are very important, Willow.

Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.

Go in the direction the bird is flying.

You!  Are you the mother of that child?

I can't.

Gawd...you're...beautiful...

Why did you say that?

Who is that girl, anyway?

We're a tiny version of all that?

Don't make me angry, Peck.

Thanks for your help, Peck.

You all right?

Because she's sick.

Where's the baby??

Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!

When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!

Madmartigan, I need your help.

She asked about you, Madmartigan.

You?

Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.

Kill him!

I hope she's all right.  How much more do I have to do of this?

What's the magician's weapon?

Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?

Ouch!!

What'd you bit me for!!

I just wanted to test it first.

I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!

Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!

Watch this.  Right between the eyes.

Are you sure?

Get back here, Rool!

She needs to be changed.

She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.

Madmartigan.

I'm getting her out of there!

This is not going well.

Hey, careful there!

Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.

Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?

I saw him.

Hey, Sam...

Are they going to kill you?

Are you really ever coming back?

Have you got your gun on now?

Amish.

What have you got?

Who else knows?

Where are you taking us?

You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!

What was that?

Now what's the problem?

Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.

Oh? Anything else?

But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?

Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.

John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.

Buttons are Hochmut.

Where's the nearest telephone?

We had some lemonade and he left.

There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.

I want you to take this... to remember by.

Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.

It's me.

Where I'm at is maybe 1890.

You're the first one he'll contact.

What's so funny?

Is the English dead?

Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.

Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.

Never seen anything like that in all my years.

He's not in this building.

Momma... are they angry with us.

I wish dawdie was with us.

Aunt Em!

Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --

Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!

Our echo.

...have you come back?

... -- Oz -- has spoken!

Uhhhh -- yes...

Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!

Run, Toto, run!

Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.

Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?

Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?

...Toto, too?

Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?

Oh --

...room --

That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.

Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...

...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.

...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.

Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.

Oh! They're - they're gone now.

Oh! Something bit me, too!

Oh, my!

Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!

Ho -- ho --ho -- ho

Who's her?  Who's her?

I'll be home in time for supper!

How about a hippopotamus?

I'd be too scared to ask him for it.

Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?

Did I scare you?

Um-hmm.

Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!

Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.

...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.

I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!

Oh, you did it yourself!

I've got a plan how to get in there.

From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.

What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 

Whozat?

...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!

You don't get around us that easy!

No, sir!

That's right.

Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!

Hey, Dorothy!

Let's.

Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!

Oh, did - did you see that?

Oh - upstairs, quickly!

Stop that dog!

He is an impostor.  Theres no Davidov at Miratom.

The plutonium is missing.  Theyve taken the core!

But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...

Hes sealed himself in.

Then maybe Id be... open to that.

Constructions not exactly my line.

I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...

He was my father.

The killer doesnt want to see this pipeline continue, doesnt want to see you take over...

I cant stay.

The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward.

Vodka martini.

What are you talking about?

So you killed your father.

That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.

Really Bond, couldnt you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?

Wheres the sub going?!

Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  Its what you wanted.

The parcels in the post.

Why?  What's the problem?

The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.

We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.

A whore fucking.

What's your theory?

I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.

In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .

I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.

Jon, I do not want to hear it.

Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.

I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.

She's with me.

Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.

Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .

Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .

Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --

Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.

Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?

-- What is it.

Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?

The Owlship.  I can't believe it.

God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.

What?

What's he doing?

I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.

He saved himself.  He changed the past.

Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.

So do I.  So do you.

. . . That was quick.

Obvious pattern -- all ties in --

Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.

Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.

. . . And they call me a fucking nut.

I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.

Nothing wrong with ketchup.

I can fix it.

No comment.

Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.

You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.

Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.

Adrian.

Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.

Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.

Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.

Why is that?

Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.

You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.

Not bad for a gimp.

I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.

What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.

Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?

This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".

You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.

All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.

He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.

Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys

They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.

Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.

Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.

Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.

What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.

My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.

Where are you going?

Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.

You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.

Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?

All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.

They tell me you're an American agent.

Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.

We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?

You're what? What the hell have you been doing?

No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.

Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.

I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.

Where are we going?

Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?

They left. To a fortress in the mountains.

Aren't you afraid?

Did you do your homework?

It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.

Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.

You're serious?

My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.

I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.

Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?

He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.

Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.

That was for Anders.

Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--

He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.

Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.

I'll tell you one thing though.

Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.

Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?

There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.

I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.

The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.

Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.

He's uptight.

Logan, do you see this ring?

This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -

I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...

I do love a good check mate.

Come with me and I'll let her live.

Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.

Where are we going?

I'll find him.

Is that so?

Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?

The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?

Carlson!

What?

MMMmm!

MMMMM!  MMMMM!

Love me oodles and oodles?

Darling!

Darling!...you will be careful!?

You have your tickets?

And your passport?

Promise??

Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.

Will you miss me?

I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.

Goodbye, darling.

Darling!

Darling!?!

What a strange fellow.

But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.

I suppose you're right.

I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.

I suppose you're right.

You mean... the laboratory??

well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.

I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?

I didn't do that.

But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?

Are you putting me on?

I see.

There wolf!  There castle!

Down!  Get down, you beasts!

But what you were doing?

What is this place?

Taking the book along?

You're sure you know what you're doing?

More, do you hear me?

Don't try to cheer me up that way.

But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.

Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.

Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.

Yes, Master!

All right -- where is she?

Thanks...for all your help.

Hello there.

MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.

Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.

Look, Doctor!

A god?

Reputation.  Reputation!

What are you going to do?

There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.

Yes, I know.

MMMMmmmmm!

His what??

It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.

I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?



You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?

Why don 't the Zulus attack?

1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir

Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?

Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right

Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?

Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.

Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
